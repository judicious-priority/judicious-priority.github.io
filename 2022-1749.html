<br>
<br>[Fun Fact, approximately half of the sixty-seven Pennsylvannia Courts of Common Pleas illegally refuse to allow 'offline public access' to PFA dockets and docket entries, along with the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas seemingly not even having the required 'public terminal' along with illegally refusing public access (by any means) to more than just PFAs.]
