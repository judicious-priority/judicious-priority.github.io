 These rules shall be known as the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure and may be cited as ‘‘Pa.R.Civ.P.

’’
Comment
   The previous use of ‘‘Pa.R.C.P. No.’’ to cite the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure may not serve as a basis to invalidate a reference to that authority.

   The rules of civil procedure are not applicable in the magisterial district courts. Civil actions and proceedings in magisterial district courts are governed by the Rules of Civil Procedure Governing Actions and Proceedings Before Magisterial District Judges, Pa.R.Civ.P.M.D.J. 201 et seq.
