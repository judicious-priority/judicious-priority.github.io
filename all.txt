Comment
   The previous use of ‘‘Pa.R.C.P. No.’’ to cite the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure may not serve as a basis to invalidate a reference to that authority.

Rule 205. [Rescinded].

Explanatory Note
   Rule 205 provided that the Code of Professional Responsibility of the American Bar Association, adopted August 12, 1969 and amended February 24, 1970, was the standard of conduct for attorneys of all courts of the Commonwealth. The Committee has long felt that such a rule was properly a rule of disciplinary enforcement rather than one of civil procedure.

   On June 28, 1976, the Court promulgated the Pennsylvania Rules of Disciplinary Enforcement which will become effective on October 27, of this year. The Definition of Disciplinary Rules as provided by Rule of Disciplinary Enforcement 102 incorporated the same Code of Professional Responsibility as that specified in Rule of Civil Procedure 205. In view of the duplication of the rules, the rescission was appropriate.

Rule 205.1. Filing Legal Papers. Mailing. Personal Presentation by Attorney Not Necessary.
 Any legal paper not requiring the signature of, or action by, a judge prior to filing may be delivered or mailed to the prothonotary, sheriff or other appropriate officer accompanied by the filing fee, if any. Neither the party nor the party’s attorney need appear personally and present such paper to the officer. The signature of an attorney on a paper constitutes a certification of authorization to file it. The endorsement of an address where papers may be served in the manner provided by Rule 440(a) shall constitute a sufficient registration of address. The notation on the paper of the attorney’s current Supreme Court identification number issued by the Court Administrator of Pennsylvania shall constitute proof of the right to practice in the Commonwealth. A paper sent by mail shall not be deemed filed until received by the appropriate officer.

   Official Note

   The address endorsed on the legal paper must be one where the paper may be handed to or mailed to the attorney. See Rule 440(a)(1).

   The filing of legal documents prepared on recycled paper of good quality is encouraged.

Rule 205.2. Filing Legal Papers with the Prothonotary.
 No pleading or other legal paper that complies with the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure shall be refused for filing by the prothonotary based on a requirement of a local rule of civil procedure or judicial administration, including local Rules 205.2(a) and 205.2(b).

   Official Note

   Rule 239.1(a) authorizes each court of common pleas to impose requirements governing the physical characteristics of pleadings and other legal papers. Rule 239.1(a) requires each court which has imposed requirements to promulgate a local rule, numbered Local Rule 205.2(a), listing the requirements.

   Similarly, Rule 239.1(b) also authorizes each court to require pleadings and other legal papers to be accompanied by a cover sheet. Rule 239.1(b) requires each court which has imposed the requirement to promulgate a local rule, numbered Local Rule 205.2(b), stating the requirement and setting forth the form of the cover sheet.

Immediately preceding text appears at serial page (340379).

Rule 205.3. Filing Pleadings and Other Legal Papers with the Prothonotary. Originals and Copies.
 (a)  A party may file with the prothonotary an original pleading or other legal paper, or a copy including a facsimile copy provided that the copy shows that the original pleading or other legal paper was properly signed and, where applicable, verified. Except as otherwise provided by law, the copy shall be deemed the equivalent of the original document.

   Official Note

   This rule does not authorize the filing of legal papers with the prothonotary by facsimile transmission, but, rather, authorized the filing of a non-original facsimile or other copy. See Rule 205.1 governing the manner of filing with the prothonotary.

   See Rule 76 for the definition of facsimile copy.

   The facsimile copy must be on paper of good quality. See Pa.R.A.P. 124(a)(1).

 (b)  If a party has filed of record a copy of a pleading or other legal paper, any other party may require the filing of the original document by filing with the prothonotary and serving upon the party who filed the copy a notice to file the original document with the prothonotary within fourteen days of the filing of the notice.

Rule 205.4. Electronic Filing and Service of Legal Papers.
 (a)(1)  A court by local rule may permit or require electronic filing of legal papers with the prothonotary and shall specify the actions and proceedings and the legal papers subject to the rule.

   Official Note

   This rule does not require the implementation of electronic filing by a local court.

   If a court determines that legal papers may be filed electronically with the prothonotary, Rule 239.9(a) requires the court to promulgate Local Rule 205.4 which shall describe the electronic filing system program and set forth the practice and procedure for the matters required by this rule.

   If a court provides that electronic filing is mandatory, it must also provide the necessary technical assistance to those parties who lack the capability to file legal papers electronically.

   (2)  As used in this rule, the following words shall have the following meanings:

    ‘‘electronic filing,’’ the electronic transmission of legal papers by means other than facsimile transmission,

    ‘‘filing party,’’ an attorney, party or other person who files a legal paper by means of electronic filing, and

    ‘‘legal paper,’’ a pleading or other paper filed in an action, including exhibits and attachments.

 (b)(1)  Legal papers shall be presented for filing in portable document format (‘‘pdf’’) or any other electronic format, if any, that the court by local rule designates. A paper presented for filing in a format other than portable document format shall be converted to portable document format and maintained by the prothonotary in that format.

   Official Note

   Rule 239.9(b)(2) requires that subdivision (b)(1) of Local Rule 205.4 specify the electronic format for presenting legal papers for filing.

   (2)  A legal paper filed electronically shall be deemed the original document.

   (3)  The electronic filing of a legal paper constitutes a certification

     (i)   by the filing party that a hard copy of the legal paper was properly signed and, where applicable, verified, and

     (ii)   as provided by Rule 1023.1(c) governing the signature to a legal paper, the violation of which shall be subject to the sanction provision of Rule 1023.1(d).

   (4)  The filing party shall maintain the signed hard copy of the document filed for two years after the later of

     (i)   the disposition of the case,

     (ii)   the entry of an order resolving the issue raised by the legal paper, or

     (iii)   the disposition by an appellate court of the issue raised by the legal paper.

   (5)  Any other party at any time may serve upon the filing party a notice to produce for inspection the signed hard copy within fourteen days of the service of the notice. The court upon motion may grant appropriate sanctions for failure to produce the signed hard copy pursuant to the notice.

 (c)(1)  The prothonotary when authorized to accept filings by electronic transmission shall provide electronic access at all times.

   (2)  The prothonotary may designate a website for the electronic filing of legal papers. Access to the website shall be available by the attorney identification number issued by the Court Administrator of Pennsylvania. The court by local rule shall designate the manner of access to the website for a filing party who is not an attorney.

   Official Note

   Rule 239.9(b)(3) requires that subdivision (c)(2) of Local Rule 205.4 specify the manner of access to the website by a filing party who is not an attorney.

   (3)  The time and date of filing submission and receipt of the legal paper to be filed electronically shall be that registered by the electronic filing system. The prothonotary shall provide, through the electronic filing system’s website, an acknowledgement that the legal paper has been received, including the date and time of receipt, in a form which can be printed for retention by the filing party.

 (d)(1)  A filing party shall pay the cost of the electronic filing of a legal paper by approved credit or debit card, or by advance deposit of sufficient funds with the prothonotary if the court by local rule so provides.

   (2)  A filing party who presents the legal paper for electronic filing in person at the office of the prothonotary shall pay the cost by a method prescribed by paragraph (1) or by check or cash.

   (3)  If a court has designated a third party to operate the electronic filing system, the filing party shall pay the cost of the electronic filing to the prothonotary or to the third party operator in the manner provided by local rule.

   Official Note

   Rule 239.9(b)(4) requires that subdivision (d)(1) of Local Rule 205.4 list the credit and debit cards approved by the court or the prothonotary, and state whether the filing fee may be paid by depositing, in advance, sufficient funds with the prothonotary.

   Rule 239.9(b)(5) provides for subdivision (d)(3) of Local Rule 205.4 to govern the payment of the filing fee to a third party operator, if applicable.

 (e)(1)  A filing party shall be responsible for any delay, disruption, interruption of the electronic signals and legibility of the document electronically filed, except when caused by the failure of the electronic filing system’s website.

   Official Note

   The filing party accepts the risk that a document filed by means of electronic filing may not be properly or timely filed with the prothonotary.

   (2)  No pleading or other legal paper that complies with the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure shall be refused for filing by the prothonotary or the electronic filing system based upon a requirement of a local rule or local administrative procedure or practice pertaining to the electronic filing of legal papers.

   Official Note

   See also Rule 205.2 governing filing legal papers with the prothonotary.

   (3)  If a pleading or other legal paper is not accepted upon presentation for filing or is refused for filing by the electronic filing system, the prothonotary or the electronic filing system, as may be appropriate, shall immediately notify the party presenting the legal paper for filing of the date of presentation, the fact that the document was not accepted or refused for filing by the system, and the reason therefor.

   (4)(i)  The court upon motion shall resolve any dispute arising under paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision.

     (ii)   If a party makes a good faith effort to electronically file a legal paper but it is not received, accepted or filed by the electronic filing system, the court may order that the paper be accepted and filed nunc pro tunc upon a showing that reasonable efforts were made to timely present and file the paper.

 (f)  When electronic filing is permitted as set forth in subdivision (a)(1), the court by local rule shall provide for

   (1)  a filing status message to the filing party,

   (2)  the maintenance by the prothonotary of an electronic file only, or of such electronic and such hard copy files as set forth in the rule,

   Official Note

   A hard copy file is not required by this rule. If the local rule requires a hard copy file, the requirement may extend to all cases or only to certain specified cases. For example, the court may require hard copy files for cases listed for trial or scheduled for argument while maintaining only electronic files for all other cases.

   (3)  additional procedures, if necessary, to ensure the security of the web site and the electronic files,

   (4)  procedures for the payment of prothonotary’s fees and costs, and

   (5)  such other procedures and matters necessary to the operation of a system of electronic filing.

   Official Note

   Rule 239.9(b)(6) provides that subdivision (f) of Local Rule 205.4 must set forth the practice and procedure with respect to the matters required by subdivision (f) of this rule.

 (g)(1)  Copies of all legal papers other than original process filed in an action or served upon any party to an action may be served

     (i)   as provided by Rule 440 or

     (ii)   by electronic transmission, other than facsimile transmission, if the parties agree thereto or an electronic mail address is included on an appearance or prior legal paper filed with the court in the action. A paper served electronically is subject to the certifications set forth in subdivision (b)(3).

   (2)  Service by electronic transmission is complete when a legal paper is sent

     (i)   to the recipient’s electronic mail address, or

     (ii)   to an electronic filing system website and an e-mail message is sent to the recipient by the electronic filing system that the legal paper has been filed and is available for review on the system’s website.

   Official Note

   Upon the electronic filing of a legal paper other than original process, the electronic filing system may automatically send notice of the filing to all parties who have agreed to service by electronic transmission or whose e-mail address is included on an appearance or prior legal paper filed in connection with the action. If the electronic filing system sends notice of such filing, the party filing the legal paper only need serve those parties who are not served by the electronic filing system.

   An electronic mail address set forth on letterhead is not a sufficient basis under this rule to permit electronic service of legal papers.

   See Rule 236(d) providing for the prothonotary to give notice of orders and judgments, and also other matters, by facsimile transmission or other electronic means.

   See Rule 440(d) governing service of legal papers other than original process by facsimile transmission.

 (h) A judicial district which implements an electronic filing system pursuant to this rule is exempt from the requirements of Rule 205.5 governing cover sheets, provided the electronic filing system has the capability of gathering and transmitting to the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts all the information required by Rule 205.5(e).

Rule 207.1. Motion to Exclude Expert Testimony Which Relies Upon Novel Scientific Evidence
 (a)  If a party moves the court to exclude expert testimony which relies upon novel scientific evidence, on the basis that it is inadmissible under Pa.R.E. 702 or 703,

   (1)  the motion shall contain:

     (i)   the name and credentials of the expert witness whose testimony is sought to be excluded,

     (ii)   a summary of the expected testimony of the expert witness, specifying with particularity that portion of the testimony of the witness which the moving party seeks to exclude,

     (iii)   the basis, set forth with specificity, for excluding the evidence,

     (iv)   the evidence upon which the moving party relies, and

     (v)   copies of all relevant curriculum vitae and expert reports;

   (2)  any other party need not respond to the motion unless ordered by the court;

   (3)  the court shall initially review the motion to determine if, in the interest of justice, the matter should be addressed prior to trial. The court, without further proceedings, may determine that any issue of admissibility of expert testimony be deferred until trial; and

   (4)  the court shall require that a response be filed If it determines that the matter should be addressed prior to trial.

   Official Note

   This rule establishes procedures for motions to exclude expert testimony which relies upon novel scientific evidence. The rule does not address the requirements for the admission of expert testimony under Pa.R.E. 702 and 703, which are governed by case law. It also does not address motions under those rules on other grounds.

   The court has discretion in the manner in which it determines the motion. While depositions of expert witnesses and evidentiary hearings are available to the court for this purpose, they should be utilized in limited circumstances. See the limitations set forth in Rule 4003.5 governing discovery of expert testimony.

   In deciding whether to address prior to trial the admissibility of the testimony of an expert witness, the following factors are among those which the court should consider: the dispositive nature or significance of the issue to the case, the complexity of the issue involved in the testimony of the expert witness, the degree of novelty of the proposed evidence, the complexity of the case, the anticipated length of trial, the potential for delay of trial, and the feasibility of the court evaluating the expert witness’ testimony when offered at trial.

   When a ruling on a pre-trial motion to exclude the testimony of an expert witness is deferred until trial, the trial judge may choose to decide the motion (1) before the expert witness testifies on the basis of evidence offered outside the presence of the jury or (2) after the expert witness testifies on the basis of testimony offered at trial, in which event the trial judge will strike the testimony of the expert witness if it is found to be inadmissible under Pa.R.E. 702 or 703. However, hearings on preliminary matters must be conducted outside the presence of the jury ‘‘when the interests of justice require.’’ See Pa.R.E. 104.

 (b)  A party is not required to raise the issue of the admissibility of testimony of an expert witness prior to trial unless the court orders the party to do so.

Rule 208.1. Motion. Definition. Scope.

Rule 208.2. Motion. Form. Content.
 (a)  A motion shall

   (1)  contain a caption setting forth the name of the court, the number of the action, the name of the motion, and the name of the moving party,

   (2)  be divided into paragraphs numbered consecutively,

   (3)  set forth material facts constituting grounds for the relief sought, specify the relief sought and include a proposed order,

   (4)  include a certificate of service which sets forth the manner of service including the name of an attorney of record for each party that is represented by counsel, the party whom the attorney represents, a ‘‘pro se’’ designation for each party that is unrepresented, and the address at which service was made, and

   (5)  be signed and endorsed.

   Official Note

   Motions are subject to Rule 440 governing service of legal papers other than original process, Rule 1023.1 governing the signing of documents, and Rule 1025 governing the endorsement of legal papers. Any requirements of a court relating to the format of a motion and cover sheet must be set forth in local rules numbered Local Rule 205.2(a) and Local Rule 205.2(b).

 (b)  A motion need not be verified unless verification is required by general rule governing the particular motion or by order of court.

   Official Note

   Rule 239.3(a) authorizes a court to require that a motion include a brief statement of the applicable authority. Rule 239.3(a) requires each court which has imposed this requirement to promulgate a local rule, numbered Local Rule 208.2(c), stating the requirement.

   Rule 239.3(b) also authorizes each court to provide a certification requirement for a motion as uncontested. Rule 239.3(b) requires each court which has imposed this requirement to promulgate a local rule, numbered Local Rule 208.2(d), stating the requirement.

   Similarly, Rule 239.3(c) authorizes each court of common pleas to require the moving party in any motion relating to discovery to certify that counsel has conferred or attempted to confer with all interested parties in order to resolve the matter without court action. Rule 239.3(c) requires each court which has imposed this requirement to promulgate a local rule, numbered Local Rule 208.2(e), stating the requirement.

Rule 208.3. Alternative Procedures.
 (a)  Except as otherwise provided by subdivision (b), the court shall initially consider a motion without written responses or briefs. For a motion governed by this subdivision, the court may not enter an order that grants relief to the moving party unless the motion is presented as uncontested or the other parties to the proceeding are given an opportunity for an argument.

   Official Note

   Rule 208.3(a) does not prevent a court from denying the moving party’s request for relief without the opportunity for an argument where the motion is procedurally defective, is untimely filed or fails to set forth adequate grounds for relief.

   Parties may choose to submit responses and briefs at the time of the presentation, provided that copies have been served on every other party. However, parties are not required to do so.

   Rule 239.3(d) requires every court to promulgate Local Rule 208.3(a) describing the local court procedure governing motions under this rule.

 (b)  A court, by local rule, numbered Local Rule 208.3(b), may impose requirements with respect to motions listed in the rule for the filing of a response, a brief or both. Where a response is required, any party opposing a motion governed by Local Rule 208.3(b) shall file the response within twenty days after service of the motion, unless the time for filing the response is modified by court order or enlarged by local rule.

   Official Note

   Motions are governed by the procedure in subdivision (a) unless the court by local rule designates particular types of motions to be governed by the procedure in subdivision (b).

   The twenty-day response period may be extended or reduced by special order of court. A local rule may only extend the time period.

   A response shall be filed by any party opposing a motion governed by subdivision (b) even if there are no contested issues of fact because the response is the opposing party’s method of indicating its opposition.

   Rule 208.3(b) authorizes each court of common pleas to impose requirements of responses and briefs with respect to designated motions. Rule 239.3(e) requires each court which has imposed such requirements to promulgate a local rule, numbered Local Rule 208.3(b), listing the motions and the requirements.

   Rule 239.3(e) also provides that Local Rule 208.3(b) must describe the local court procedure governing motions under subdivision (b) and may allow the court to treat the motion as uncontested if a response is not filed.

Rule 208.4. Initial Consideration of Motion. Court Orders. Issues of Disputed Fact.
 (a)  At the initial consideration of a motion, the court may enter an order that

   (1)  disposes of the motion, or

   (2)  sets forth the procedures the court will use for deciding the motion which may include one or more of the following:

     (i)   the filing of initial or supplemental responses,

     (ii)   the filing of initial or supplemental briefs,

     (iii)   the filing of affidavits, depositions and the like,

     (iv)   the issuance of a rule to show cause pursuant to subdivision (b) of this rule,

     (v)   the holding of an evidentiary hearing, and

     (vi)   the entry of an order providing for any other procedure for developing the record.

 (b)(1) If the moving party seeks relief based on disputed facts for which a record must be developed, the court, upon its own motion or the request of any party including the moving party, may enter an order in the form set forth in paragraph (2) providing for the issuance of a rule to show cause. The procedure following issuance of the rule to show cause shall be in accordance with Rule 206.7.

   Official Note

   A court will not necessarily utilize the rule to show cause procedure of subdivision (b) because other methods for developing the record, such as the filing of affidavits, may be the most efficient and appropriate manner for developing a record.

   (2)  The order required by paragraph (1) shall be substantially in the following form:

Rule 212. Pre-Trial Conference.

   (Editor’s Note: Rule 212 was renumbered as Rule 212.3 pursuant to an order dated August 11, 1997, effective December 1, 1997.)

Rule 212.1. Civil actions to be tried by jury. Notice of earliest trial date. Time for completing discovery and filing pre-trial statement.
 (a)  In a civil action in which the damages sought exceed the jurisdictional limit for compulsory arbitration and which is to be tried by a jury, notice shall be given by the court of the earliest date on which the case may be tried. The notice should be given at least thirty days before the plaintiff’s pre-trial statement is due to be filed. The notice may include a date by which discovery shall be completed.

 (c) (1)  The times set forth in subdivision (b) may be made earlier by published local rule or by special order or as set forth in a trial list published in the county law journal or otherwise made available to the parties.

   (2)  The times set forth in subdivision (b) may be made later by published local rule or by special order in a particular case.

   A listing of ‘‘anyone named in discovery’’ is insufficient under this rule. A listing of a ‘‘records custodian’’ of a specific entity is a sufficient listing.

 (d)  The court may make an order reciting the action taken at the conference and the agreements made by the parties as to any of the matters considered, and limiting the issues for trial to those not disposed of by admissions or agreements of the attorneys. Such order when entered shall control the subsequent course of the action unless modified at the trial to prevent manifest injustice.

 (e)  The court may establish by rule a pre-trial list on which actions may be placed for consideration as above provided, and may either confine the list to jury actions or to non-jury actions, or extend it to all actions.

Rule 213. Consolidation, Severance and Transfer of Actions and Issues within a County. Actions for Wrongful Death and Survival Actions.
 (a)  In actions pending in a county which involve a common question of law or fact or which arise from the same transaction or occurrence, the court on its own motion or on motion of any party may order a joint hearing or trial of any matter in issue in the actions, may order the actions consolidated, and may make orders that avoid unnecessary cost or delay.

 (b)  The court, in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice, may, on its own motion or on motion of any party, order a separate trial of any cause of action, claim, or counterclaim, set-off, or cross-suit, or of any separate issue, or of any number of causes of action, claims, counter-claims, set-offs, cross-suits, or issues.

 (c)  [Rescinded]

 (d)  [Rescinded]

 (e)  A cause of action for the wrongful death of a decedent and a cause of action for the injuries of the decedant which survives his or her death may be enforced in one action, but if independent actions are commenced they shall be consolidated for trial.

   (1)  If independent actions are commenced or are pending in the same court, the court, on its own motion or the motion of any party, shall order the actions consolidated for trial.

   (2)  If independent actions are commenced in different courts, the court in which the second action was commenced, on its own motion or the motion of any party, shall order the action transferred to the court in which the first action was commenced.

   (3)  If an action is commenced to enforce one cause of action, the court, on its own motion or the motion of any party, may stay the action until an action is commenced to enforce the other cause of action and is consolidated therewith or until the commencement of such second action is barred by the applicable statute of limitation.

 (f)  When an action is commenced in a court which has no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action it shall not be dismissed if there is another court of appropriate jurisdiction within the Commonwealth in which the action could originally have been brought but the court shall transfer the action at the cost of the plaintiff to the court of appropriate jurisdiction. It shall be the duty of the prothonotary or clerk of the court in which the action is commenced to transfer the record together with a certified copy of the docket entries to the prothonotary or clerk of the court to which the action is transferred.

Subdivisions (c) and (d) have been rendered unnecessary in view of the abolition of the former Municipal Court of Philadelphia and the County Court of Allegheny County by the Constitution of 1968.

   For transfer of actions from counties of improper venue, see Rule 1006(e).

Explanatory Note
   Prior to 1969, two county courts existed in Pennsylvania. The Municipal Court of Philadelphia was created by the Act of July 12, 1913, P. L. 711, §  1, 17 P. S. §  681, and subsequently renamed the County Court of Philadelphia by the Act of July 17, 1961, P. L. 781, §  1, 17 P. S. §  705. The County Court of Allegheny County was created by the Act of May 5, 1911, P. L. 198, §  1, 17 P. S. §  621. Both of these courts were abolished by the Constitution of 1968.

   Business of the Court Rules 213(c) and (d) refer to transfers between county courts and common pleas courts. Joinder of Parties Rule 2231(b) is predicated on the jurisdiction of the county courts. These sub-divisions are obsolete.

   Trespass Rule 1044(c) refers to county courts. This reference is also obsolete.

   Rules 213(c) and (d) and 2231(b) have been rescinded and the reference to a county court in Rule 1044(c) has been deleted. Appropriate notes have been added to each Rule.

Rule 213.1. Coordination of Actions in Different Counties.
 (a)  In actions pending in different counties which involve a common question of law or fact or which arise from the same transaction or occurrence, any party, with notice to all other parties, may file a motion requesting the court in which a complaint was first filed to order coordination of the actions. Any party may file an answer to the motion and the court may hold a hearing.

 (b)  The court in which the complaint was first filed may stay the proceedings in any action which is the subject of the motion.

 (c)  In determining whether to order coordination and which location is appropriate for the coordinated proceedings, the court shall consider, among other matters:

   (1)  whether the common question of fact or law is predominating and significant to the litigation;

   (2)  the convenience of the parties, witnesses and counsel;

   (3)  whether coordination will result in unreasonable delay or expense to a party or otherwise prejudice a party in an action which would be subject to coordination;

   (4)  the efficient utilization of judicial facilities and personnel and the just and efficient conduct of the actions;

   (5)  the disadvantages of duplicative and inconsistent rulings, orders or judgments;

   (6)  the likelihood of settlement of the actions without further litigation should coordination be denied.

 (d)  If the court orders that actions shall be coordinated, it may

   (1)  stay any or all of the proceedings in any action subject to the order, or

   (2)  transfer any or all further proceedings in the actions to the court or courts in which any of the action is pending, or

   (3)  make any other appropriate order.

 (e)  In the order of coordination, the court shall include the manner of giving notice of the order to all parties in all actions subject thereto and direct that specified parties pay the costs, if any, of coordination. The court shall also order that a certified copy of the order of coordination be sent to the courts in which the actions subject to the order are pending, whereupon whose courts shall take such action as may be appropriate to carry out the coordination order.

 (f)  The final order disposing of a coordinated action or proceeding shall be certified and sent to the court in which the action was originally commenced to be filed of record.

   Official Note

   The subject matter of former Rule 215.1 governing the duty of common pleas courts in Commonwealth Court jury trial cases is now governed by Rule 3735 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure, adopted November 5, 1975 and effective July 1, 1976.

Rule 216. Grounds for Continuance.
 (a)  The following are grounds for continuance:

   (1)  Agreement of all parties or their attorneys, if approved by the Court;

   (2)  Illness of counsel of record, a material witness, or a party. If requested a certificate of a physician shall be furnished, stating that such illness will probably be of sufficient duration to prevent the ill person from participating in the trial;

   (3)  Inability to subpoena or to take testimony by deposition, commission, or letters rogatory, of any material witness, shown by affidavit which shall state:

     (i)   The facts to which the witness would testify if present or if deposed;

     (ii)   The grounds for believing that the absent witness would so testify;

     (iii)   The efforts made to procure the attendance or deposition of such absent witness; and

     (iv)   The reasons for believing that the witness will attend the trial at a subsequent date, or that the deposition of the witness can and will be obtained.

   (4)  Such special ground as may be allowed in the discretion of the court;

   (5)  The scheduling of counsel to appear at any proceeding under the Pennsylvania Rules of Disciplinary Enforcement, whether:

     (i)   as counsel for a respondent-attorney before a hearing committee, hearing officer, the Disciplinary Board or the Supreme Court;

     (ii)   as a hearing officer or member of a hearing committee; or

     (iii)   as a member of the Disciplinary Board;

   (6)  The scheduling of counsel to appear at any proceeding involving the discipline of a justice, judge or magisterial district judge under Section 18 of Article V of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, whether:

     (i)   as counsel for a justice, judge, or magisterial district judge before the special tribunal provided for in 42 Pa.C.S. §  727, the Court of Judicial Discipline, the Judicial Conduct Board or any hearing committee or other arm of the Judicial Conduct Board; or

     (ii)   as a member of the Court of Judicial Discipline, the Judicial Conduct Board or any hearing committee or other arm of the Judicial Conduct Board.

 (b)  Except for cause shown in special cases, no reason above enumerated for the continuance of a case shall be of effect beyond one application made in behalf of one party or group of parties having similar interests.

 (c)  No application for a continuance shall be granted if based on a cause existing and known at the time of publication or prior call of the trial list unless the same is presented to the court at a time fixed by the court, which shall be at least one week before the first day of the trial period. Applications for continuances shall be made to the court, or filed in writing with the officer in charge of the trial list, after giving notice of such application by mail, or otherwise, to all parties or their attorneys. Each court may, by local rule, designate the time of publication of the trial list for the purposes of this rule.

 (d)  No continuance shall be granted due to the absence from court of a witness duly subpoenaed, unless:

   (1)  Such witness will be absent because of facts arising subsequent to the service of the subpoena and which would be a proper ground for continuance under the provisions of Rule 216(a); or

   (2)  On the day when the presence of such witness is required a prompt application is made for the attachment of such absent witness; or

   (3)  The witness, having attended at court has departed without leave, and an application for attachment is made promptly after the discovery of the absence of such witness; or the court is satisfied that the witness has left court for reasons which would be a proper ground for continuance under Rule 216(a).

 (e)  Each Court may adopt local rules providing for the temporary passing of cases or governing applications for continuance because of the absence of a witness, not a party, who has not been served with a subpoena.

 (f)  Rule 216(b)—(e) and Rule 217 shall not be applicable to a continuance granted for any of the reasons set forth in Rule 216(a)(5) or (6).

Rule 217. Costs on Continuance.
 When a continuance is granted upon application made subsequent to the preliminary call of the trial list, the court may impose on the party making the application the reasonable costs actually incurred by the opposing party which would not have been incurred if the application had been made at or prior to such preliminary call.

 Where a continuance has been so granted and costs imposed, the party upon whom such costs have been imposed, may not, so long as such costs remain unpaid, take any further step in such suit without prior leave of court.

 A party upon whom such costs are so imposed and who was at fault in delaying the application for continuance may not recover such costs, if ultimately successful in the action; otherwise such costs shall follow the judgment in the action.

Rule 218. Party not Ready when Case is Called for Trial.
 (a)  Where a case is called for trial, if without satisfactory excuse a plaintiff is not ready the court may enter a nonsuit on motion of the defendant or a non pros on the court’s own motion.

 (b)  If without satisfactory excuse a defendant is not ready, the plaintiff may

   (1)  proceed to trial, or,

   (2)  if the case called for trial is an appeal from compulsory arbitration, either proceed to trial or request the court to dismiss the appeal and reinstate the arbitration award.

   Official Note

   See Rule 1007.1(c)(2) for withdrawal of demand for trial by jury when a party who has filed a demand therefor fails to appear or is not ready.

 (c) A party who fails to appear for trial shall be deemed to be not ready without satisfactory excuse.

   Official Note

   The mere failure to appear for trial is a ground for the entry of a nonsuit or a judgment of nonpros or the reinstatement of a compulsory arbitration award.

   A nonsuit is subject to the filing of a motion under Rule 227.1(a)(3) for post-trial relief to remove the nonsuit and a judgment of non pros is subject to the filing of a petition under Rule 3051 for relief from a judgment of non pros.

   A decision of the court following a trial at which the defendant failed to appear is subject to the filing of a motion for post-trial relief which may include a request for a new trial on the ground of a satisfactory excuse for the defendant’s failure to appear.

Rule 219. View of Premises.
 A party desiring to have the jury view any premises involved in the litigation, may make application thereof either prior to the call of the case for trial, or at the bar during the actual trial of the case. In all such cases, the allowance of the application shall be within the discretion of the court, which may impose upon the applicant such reasonable costs or expenses as may be involved in connection with such view, or may direct that any costs thereby incurred shall follow the judgment entered in such action as in other cases.

Rule 220.1. Preliminary Instructions to Prospective and Selected Jurors.
 (a)  For purposes of this rule, ‘‘prospective jurors’’ means those persons who have been chosen to be part of the panel from which the trial jurors and alternate jurors will be selected. ‘‘Selected jurors’’ means those members of the panel who have been selected to serve as trial jurors or alternate jurors. ‘‘Jury service’’ means service as (1) members of the jury array, (2) prospective jurors, and (3) selected jurors.

   (2)  read or listen to any news reports about any such case;

   (3)  use a computer, cellular telephone, or other electronic device with communication capabilities while in attendance at trial or during deliberation. These devices may be used during breaks or recesses but may not be used to obtain or disclose information prohibited in subdivision (c)(4);

Rule 220.3. Voir Dire of Jurors.
 (a)  Judge’s Presence Required. Voir dire of prospective jurors shall be conducted, and the jurors shall be selected, in the presence of a judge, unless the judge’s presence is waived by all parties with the consent of the court.

 (b) Instruction of Juror Duties. Upon completion of the oath, the judge shall instruct the prospective jurors upon their duties and restrictions while serving as jurors, and of any sanctions for violation of those duties and restrictions, including those in Rules 220.1 and 220.2.

 (c) Juror Information. Voir dire shall be conducted to provide the opportunity to obtain, at a minimum, a full description of the following information, where relevant, concerning the prospective jurors and their households:

   (1)  name;

   (2)  year and place of birth;

   (3)  residential neighborhood and zip code (not street address);

   (4)  marital status;

   (5)  nature and extent of education;

   (6)  number and ages of children;

   (7)  name, age, and relationship of members of prospective juror’s household;

   (8)  occupation and employment history of the prospective juror, the juror’s spouse and children, and members of the juror’s household;

   (9)  involvement as a party or a witness in a civil lawsuit or a criminal case;

   (10)  relationship, friendship, or association with a law enforcement officer, a lawyer, or any person affiliated with the courts of any judicial district;

   (11)  relationship of the prospective juror or any member of the prospective juror’s immediate family to the insurance industry, including employee, claims adjustor, investigator, agent, or stockholder in an insurance company;

   (12)  motor vehicle operation and licensure;

   (13)  physical or mental condition affecting ability to serve on a jury;

   (14)  reasons the prospective juror believes the prospective juror cannot or should not serve as a juror;

   (15)  relationship, friendship, or association with the parties, the attorneys, and prospective witnesses of the particular case to be heard;

   (16)  ability to refrain from using a computer, cellular telephone, or other electronic device with communication capabilities in violation of the provisions of Rule 220.1; and

   (17)  such other pertinent information as may be appropriate to the particular case to achieve a competent, fair, and impartial jury.

 (d) Voir Dire by Written Questionnaire Permitted. The court may provide for voir dire to include the use of a written questionnaire. The use of a written questionnaire without the opportunity for oral examination by the court or counsel is not a sufficient voir dire.

 (e) Individual Voir Dire Permitted. The court may permit all or part of the examination of a juror out of the presence of other jurors.

 (f) Recording of Voir Dire. Voir dire, including all rulings by a judge, shall be recorded in full unless the recording is waived by all parties. The recording shall be transcribed only upon written request of a party or order of court.

Comment:
   Subdivision (a)—The permitted waiver is a waiver only of the judge’s physical presence during voir dire. It is not a waiver of a party’s opportunity to create a record or to have the judge make decisions based upon that record. This subdivision is also intended to provide flexibility to permit another judge, or a senior judge, in the judicial district to preside over voir dire, as circumstances warrant.

   Subdivision (c)(17)—See Capoferri v. Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, 893 A.2d 133 (Pa. Super. 2006) (en banc) (voir dire should have been allowed with respect to the effect of pre-trial publicity on prospective jurors’ ‘‘attitudes regarding medical malpractice and tort reform’’), as an example of the type of information that may be sought from potential jurors to achieve a competent, fair, and impartial jury in a particular case.

   Subdivision (d)—The parties or their attorneys may conduct voir dire of the prospective jurors unless the court itself conducts voir dire or otherwise directs that voir dire be conducted by a court employee. Any dispute shall be resolved by the court.

   A written questionnaire may be used to facilitate and expedite voir dire by providing the trial judge and attorneys with basic background information about the jurors, thereby eliminating the need for many commonly asked questions.

Historical Commentary
   The following commentary is historical in nature and represents statements of the Committee at the time of rulemaking:

Explanatory Comment—1997
   New Rule 220.1 governing voir dire, the examination of prospective jurors, furthers the goal of establishing a uniform civil practice throughout the Commonwealth with respect to the information which the parties may obtain concerning prospective jurors.

   The rule specifies the information which the parties should be able to obtain through voir dire but does not require a particular manner of voir dire. Subdivision (a) is devoted to listing the information to which the parties are entitled.

   The rule does not dictate the mechanics of voir dire, but leaves the method of voir dire to the local courts of common pleas. Subdivision (b) does give some guidance, however. Voir dire may include the use of a written questionnaire, but no form of questionnaire is mandated or suggested. The note observes that a written questionnaire may ‘‘facilitate and expedite’’ voir dire by providing basic background information. The rule provides that ‘‘the use of a written questionnaire without the opportunity for oral examination is not a sufficient voir dire.’’ The parties are entitled to both hear prospective jurors and observe their demeanor.

   The rule recognizes that service upon a jury may be a new and disquieting experience to citizens called as prospective jurors. Information may be sought which a prospective juror feels uncomfortable revealing in open court. Thus, subdivision (c) provides that the ‘‘court may permit all or part of the examination of a juror out of the presence of other jurors.’’

Explanatory Comment—2008
   Rule 220.1 governing voir dire has been amended with the addition of a note to subdivision (a)(16). Subdivision (a) lists the information to which parties are entitled to obtain during voir dire, concluding with a catch-all provision in subparagraph (16). The note cites Capoferri v. Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, 893 A.2d 133 (Pa. Super. 2006) (en banc), as an example of the type of information that may be sought from potential jurors pursuant to subparagraph (16) to achieve a competent, fair and impartial jury in a particular case.

Explanatory Comment—2015
   The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has adopted new Rules 220.1 and 220.2 and the amendment of current Rules 220.1 and 223.1. The changes are intended to provide guidance to the bench and bar regarding the use of electronic devices by jurors in civil cases.

   The new rules and amendments provide for jurors to be instructed that the use of electronic devices is restricted during their tenure as a prospective juror, i.e. a member of the jury pool, and as a selected juror. The new provisions require the trial court to instruct jurors that they may not conduct independent research on the Internet about the case, communicate about the case electronically, e.g. ‘‘tweet’’ or ‘‘blog,’’ or use such devices during juror service. A trial court is required to instruct jurors at the earliest opportunity of interaction between the juror and the trial court, and then repeat those instructions as often as practicable. The new rules and amendments provide for sanctions against any person who violates the provisions of these rules. It should also be noted that a note to new Rule 220.1 cross-references Section 1.180 of the Pennsylvania Suggested Civil Jury Instructions, Pa. SSJI (Civ), §  1.180. These instructions specifically address the use of electronic devices by jurors.

   While the proposal focuses on the use of electronic devices by jurors, it remains silent as to their use in the courtroom by the public and media. Rule of Judicial Administration 1910 outlines the responsibility of a trial court regarding the broadcasting, televising, or taking of photographs in the courtroom in civil proceedings.

Rule 223. Conduct of the Trial. Generally.
 Subject to the requirements of due process of law and of the constitutional rights of the parties, the court may make and enforce rules and orders covering any of the following matters, inter alia:

   (1)  Limiting the number of witnesses whose testimony is similar or cumulative;

   (2)  Limiting the number of attorneys representing the same party or the same group of parties, who may actively participate in the trial of the case or may examine or cross-examine a witness or witnesses;

   (3)  Regulating the number and length of addresses to the jury or to the court;

   (4)  Regulating or excluding the public or persons not interested in the proceedings whenever the court deems such regulation or exclusion to be in the interest of the public good, order or morals.

   Official Note

   Trial courts in Pennsylvania customarily exercise discretion as to the exclusion of persons from the courtroom in the interest of good order and morals.

   The exclusion of the taking of photographs or radio or television broadcasting is governed by Pa.R.J.A. No. 1910.

   Official Note

   This rule catalogs certain procedures which may be utilized in the conduct of a jury trial. Since the court has broad power and discretion in the manner in which it conducts a jury trial, it is not intended that this rule be construed as enlarging, restricting or in any way affecting that power and discretion.

Rule 223.2. Conduct of the Jury Trial. Juror Note Taking.
 (a)(1)  Jurors shall be permitted to take notes during the presentation of evidence, opening statements, and closing arguments and use their notes during deliberations.

   (2)  Jurors shall not be permitted to take notes when the judge is instructing the jury as to the law that will govern the case.

 (b)  The court shall give an appropriate cautionary instruction to the jury prior to opening statements. The instruction shall include:

   (1)  Jurors are not required to take notes and those who take notes are not required to take extensive notes;

   (2)  Note taking should not divert jurors from paying full attention to the evidence and evaluating witness credibility, the opening statements, or the closing arguments;

   (3)  Notes are merely memory aids and are not evidence or the official record;

   (4)  Jurors who take few or no notes should not permit their independent recollection of the evidence to be influenced by the fact that other jurors have taken notes;

   (5)  Notes are confidential and will not be reviewed by the court or anyone else;

   (6)  A juror may not show his or her notes or disclose their contents to other jurors until deliberations begin, but may show the notes or disclose the contents during deliberations;

   (7)  Jurors shall not take their notes out of the courtroom except to use their notes during deliberations; and

   (8)  All juror notes will be collected after the trial is over and immediately destroyed.

   Official Note

   It is recommended that the trial judge instruct the jurors along the following lines:

   We will distribute notepads and pens to each of you in the event you wish to take notes during the trial. You are under no obligation to take notes and those who take notes are not required to take extensive notes.

   Remember that one of your responsibilities as a juror is to observe the demeanor of witnesses to help you assess their credibility. If you do take notes, do not become so involved with note taking that it interferes with your ability to observe a witness or distracts you from hearing other answers being given by the witness.

   You may also take notes while the attorneys’ present their opening statements and when they will make their closing arguments about the evidence at the end of the trial. Again, if you do take notes, do not become so involved with note taking that it distracts from paying attention to the remainder of the opening statement or hearing all of the closing argument.

   Your notes may help you refresh your recollection of the evidence as well as the attorneys’ opening statements or their closing arguments. Your notes should be treated as a supplement to, rather than a substitute for, your memory. Your notes are only to be used by you as memory aids and are not evidence or the official record.

   Those of you who do not take notes should not permit your independent recollection of the evidence to be influenced by the fact that other jurors have taken notes. It is just as easy to write something down incorrectly as it is to remember it incorrectly and your fellow jurors’ notes are entitled to no greater weight than each juror’s independent memory. Although you may refer to your notes during deliberations, give no more or no less weight to the view of a fellow juror just because that juror did or did not take notes.

   Each time that we adjourn, your notes will be collected and secured by court staff. Jurors shall not take their notes out of the courtroom except to use their notes during deliberations.

   A juror may not show his or her notes or disclose their contents to other jurors until deliberations begin, but may show the notes or disclose their contents during deliberations. The only notes you may use during the deliberations are the notes you write in the courtroom during the proceedings on the materials distributed by the court staff.

   Your notes are completely confidential and will not be reviewed by the court or anyone else. After the trial is over, your notes will be collected by court personnel and immediately destroyed.

 (c)  The court shall

   (1)  provide materials suitable for note taking,

   Official Note

   The materials provided by the court are the only materials that jurors may use for note taking.

   (2)  safeguard all juror notes at each recess and at the end of each trial day, and

   (3)  collect all juror notes as soon as the jury is dismissed and, without inspection, immediately destroy them.

 (d)(1)  Neither the court nor counsel may (i) request or suggest that jurors take notes, (ii) comment on their note taking, or (iii) attempt to read any notes.

   (2)  Juror notes may not be used by any party to the litigation as a basis for a request for a new trial.

   Official Note

   A court shall immediately deny a litigant’s request that juror notes be placed under seal until they are reviewed in connection with a request for a new trial on any ground, including juror misconduct. The notes shall be destroyed without inspection as soon as the jury is dismissed.

Rule 223.3. Conduct of the Trial. Actions for Bodily Injury or Death. Jury  Instructions on Noneconomic Loss.
 In any action for bodily injury or death in which a plaintiff has raised a claim for a damage award for noneconomic loss that is viable under applicable substantive law, the court shall give the following instructions to the jury.

 The plaintiff has made a claim for a damage award for past and for future noneconomic loss. There are four items that make up a damage award for noneco- nomic loss, both past and future: (1) pain and suffering; (2) embarrassment and humiliation; (3) loss of ability to enjoy the pleasures of life; and (4) disfigurement.

  The first item to be considered in the plaintiff’s claims for damage awards for past noneconomic loss and for future noneconomic loss is pain and suffering. You are instructed that plaintiff is entitled to be fairly and adequately compensated for all physical pain, mental anguish, discomfort, inconvenience, and distress that you find (he) (she) has endured from the time of the injury until today and that plaintiff is also entitled to be fairly and adequately compensated for all physical pain, mental anguish, discomfort, inconvenience, and distress you find (he) (she) will endure in the future as a result of (his) (her) injuries.

  The second item that goes to make up noneconomic loss is embarrassment and humiliation. Plaintiff is entitled to be fairly and adequately compensated for such embarrassment and humiliation as you believe (he) (she) has endured and will continue to endure in the future as a result of (his) (her) injuries.

  The third item is loss of enjoyment of life. Plaintiff is entitled to be fairly and adequately compensated for the loss of (his) (her) ability to enjoy any of the pleasures of life as a result of the injuries from the time of the injuries until today and to be fairly and adequately compensated for the loss of (his) (her) ability to enjoy any of the pleasures of life in the future as a result of (his) (her) injuries.

  The fourth and final item is disfigurement. The disfigurement that plaintiff has sustained is a separate item of damages recognized by the law. Therefore, in addition to any sums you award for pain and suffering, for embarrassment and humiliation, and for loss of enjoyment of life, the plaintiff is entitled to be fairly and adequately compensated for the disfigurement (he) (she) has suffered from the time of the injury to the present and that (he) (she) will continue to suffer during the future duration of (his) (her) life.

  In considering plaintiff’s claims for damage awards for past and future noneconomic loss, you will consider the following factors: (1) the age of the plaintiff; (2) the severity of the injuries; (3) whether the injuries are temporary or permanent; (4) the extent to which the injuries affect the ability of the plaintiff to perform basic activities of daily living and other activities in which the plaintiff previously engaged; (5) the duration and nature of medical treatment; (6) the duration and extent of the physical pain and mental anguish which the plaintiff has experienced in the past and will experience in the future; (7) the health and physical condition of the plaintiff prior to the injuries; and (8) in case of disfigurement, the nature of the disfigurement and the consequences for the plaintiff.

   Official Note

   These instructions may be modified by agreement of the parties or by the court, based on circumstances of the case.

Rule 224. Regulation of Order of Proof.
 The court may compel the plaintiff in any action to produce all evidence upon the question of the defendant’s liability before calling any witness to testify solely to the extent of the injury or damages. The defendant’s attorney may then move for a nonsuit. If the motion is refused, the trial shall proceed. The court may, however, allow witnesses to be called out of order if the court deems it wise so to do.

Rule 225. Summing Up.
 Attorneys for each party or group of parties may make an opening address to the jury and may also make an address to the jury after the close of the testimony.

   Rule 225 merely confers the right to make addresses to the jury as stated therein. The trial court by local rule or otherwise may regulate the number, length, and order of addresses. See Rule 223(3).

Rule 226. Points for Charge. Motion for Directed Verdict.
 (a)  Points upon which the trial judge is requested to charge the jury shall be so framed that each may be completely answered by a simple affirmation or negation. Attorneys shall hand copies of requested points for charge to the trial judge and to the opposing attorneys before the closing addresses to the jury are begun. A requested point for charge that was presented to the trial judge becomes part of the record when the point is read into the record, or filed in the office of the prothonotary prior to filing a motion for post-trial relief regarding the requested point for charge.

   Official Note

   An appellate court will not review an objection to a ruling of a trial court regarding a point for charge unless the point for charge was (1) presented to the court and (2) made a part of the record by either reading the point into the record or filing it in the office of the prothonotary prior to filing a motion for post-trial relief.

 (b)  At the close of all the evidence, the trial judge may direct a verdict upon the oral or written motion of any party.

Rule 227. Exceptions.
 (a)  It shall not be necessary on the trial of any action or proceeding to take exception to any ruling of the trial judge. An exception in favor of the party against whom the adverse ruling was made shall be deemed to have been taken with the same force and effect as if it had been requested, noted by the official stenographer and thereafter written out, signed and sealed by the trial judge.

 (b)  Unless specially allowed by the court, all exceptions to the charge to the jury shall be taken before the jury retires. On request of any party all such exceptions and arguments thereon shall be made out of hearing of the jury.

Rule 227.1. Post-Trial Relief.
 (a)  After trial and upon the written Motion for Post-Trial Relief filed by any party, the court may

   (1)  order a new trial as to all or any of the issues; or

   (2)  direct the entry of judgment in favor of any party; or

   (3)  remove a nonsuit; or

   (4)  affirm, modify or change the decision; or

   (5)  enter any other appropriate order.

 (b)  Except as otherwise provided by Pa.R.E. 103(a), post-trial relief may not be granted unless the grounds therefor,

   (1)  if then available, were raised in pre-trial proceedings or by motion, objection, point for charge, request for findings of fact or conclusions of law, offer of proof or other appropriate method at trial; and

   (2)  are specified in the motion. The motion shall state how the grounds were asserted in pre-trial proceedings or at trial. Grounds not specified are deemed waived unless leave is granted upon cause shown to specify additional grounds.

 (c)  Post-trial motions shall be filed within ten days after

   (1)  verdict, discharge of the jury because of inability to agree, or nonsuit in the case of a jury trial; or

   (2)  notice of nonsuit or the filing of the decision in the case of a trial without jury.

   If a party has filed a timely post-trial motion, any other party may file a post-trial motion within ten days after the filing of the first post-trial motion.

 (d)  A motion for post-trial relief shall specify the relief requested and may request relief in the alternative. Separate reasons shall be set forth for each type of relief sought.

 (e)  If a new trial and the entry of judgment are sought in the alternative, the court shall dispose of both requests. If the court directs the entry of judgment, it shall also rule on the request for a new trial by determining whether it should be granted if the judgment is thereafter vacated or reversed, and shall specify the grounds for granting or denying the request for a new trial.

 (f)  The party filing a post-trial motion shall serve a copy promptly upon every other party to the action and deliver a copy to the trial judge.

 (g)  A motion for post-trial relief may not be filed in an appeal from the final adjudication or determination of a local agency or a Commonwealth agency as to which jurisdiction is vested in the courts of common pleas.

 (h)  A motion for post-trial relief shall be filed following a trial upon an appeal from the decision of viewers pursuant to the Eminent Domain Code.

 (i)  When an appellate court has remanded a case for further proceedings, a motion for post-trial relief relating to subsequent rulings in the trial court shall not be required unless

   (1)  the appellate court has specified that the remand is for a complete or partial new trial, or

   (2)  the trial court indicates in its order resolving the remand issues that a motion for post-trial relief is required pursuant to this rule.

Comment:
   Subdivision (a). The motion for post-trial relief replaces the following motions and exceptions: motion for new trial, motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, motion upon the whole record after disagreement of a jury, motion in arrest of judgment, motion to remove a nonsuit and exceptions following the decision of the judge in a trial without jury.

   The following rules provide for the filing of exceptions, e.g., Rule 1534 (exceptions to a fiduciary’s account), Rule 1569 (exceptions to a hearing officer’s report in partition), Rule 1920.55-2 (exceptions to a hearing officer’s report in an action for divorce), Rule 1910.12(e) (exceptions to a hearing officer’s report in an action for support), and Rule 3136(d) (exceptions to sheriff’s schedule of proposed distribution).

   Subdivision (b) states two requirements for the granting of post-trial relief. First, the grounds for the relief requested must have been raised in pre-trial proceedings or at trial and, second, they must be stated in the motion. Under subdivision (b)(1), if no objection is made, error which could have been corrected in pre-trial proceedings, i.e., a ground for a new trial or a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, or during trial by timely objection, may not constitute a ground for post-trial relief. It must be raised timely in pre-trial proceedings or during the trial, thus affording the court the opportunity to correct the error.

   Pa.R.E. 103(a) provides that the specific ground for an overruled objection, or the substance of excluded evidence, need not be stated at or prior to trial, or without having made an offer of proof, if the ground of the objection, or the substance of the evidence sought to be introduced, was apparent from the context.

   Under subdivision (b)(2), motions which set forth mere ‘‘boilerplate’’ language are specifically disapproved. Rather, the motion must state ‘‘the specific grounds therefor.’’ A post-trial motion must set forth the theories in support thereof ‘‘so that the lower court will know what it is being asked to decide.’’ Frank v. Peckich, 391 A.2d 624, 632-633 (Pa. Super. 1978).

   Subdivision (c). A motion for post-trial relief may be filed following a trial by jury or a trial by a judge without a jury pursuant to Rule 1038. A motion for post-trial relief may not be filed to orders disposing of preliminary objections, motions for judgment on the pleadings, motions for summary judgment, or motions relating to discovery or other proceedings, which do not constitute a trial. See U.S. National Bank in Johnstown v. Johnson, 487 A.2d 809 (Pa. 1985).

   A motion for post-trial relief may not be filed to matters governed exclusively by the rules of petition practice.

   The filing of a motion for post-trial relief is prohibited by the following rules: Rule 1557 (order directing partition) and Rule 1930.2 (no post-trial practice in domestic relations matters).

   Subdivision (g). See 2 Pa.C.S. §  101 for the definition of ‘‘local agency.’’

   See 42 Pa.C.S. §  933(a)(1) providing for jurisdiction of appeals from determinations of particular Commonwealth agencies to be in the courts of common pleas.

   Subdivision (h). Any distinction with respect to the filing of a motion for post-trial relief between jury and non-jury trials following an appeal from the decision of viewers in eminent domain proceedings is eliminated.

Historical Commentary
   The following commentary is historical in nature and represents statements of the Committee at the time of rulemaking:

EXPLANATORY COMMENT—1983
   Introduction

   The Judicial Code and the Judiciary Act Repealer Act (JARA) have repealed Acts of Assembly which formed the basis for the entry of compulsory nonsuits and post-trial practice. The Code and JARA contemplate that the subject matter of the repealed statutes shall be governed by general rules. These amendments to the Rules of Civil Procedure supply the necessary procedure.

   The amendments abolish the distinctions which have existed heretofore in post-trial practice. A party who seeks post-trial relief will do so by filing a Motion for Post-Trial Relief irrespective of whether the action is at law or in equity or whether the action is tried with or without a jury. New Rules 227.1 to 227.4 inclusive apply to all such actions.

   A detailed analysis of the changes in practice effected by the amendments follows each rule.

   Conforming Amendments

   In view of the new consolidated post-trial practice under Rule 227.1, a number of conforming amendments are made to rules governing the actions in equity and for partition, the family law actions of support and divorce and actions involving minors and incompetents.

   The amendment to Rule 1557 governing partition reverses the current practice of filing exceptions to an order directing partition. The amended rule specifically provides that exceptions to such an order shall not be filed. Rather, relief may be sought through an appeal in accordance with Rule of Appellate Procedure 311(a)(6), as indicated in the note to Rule 1557.

   The term ‘‘exceptions’’ is used in the rules in contexts other than post-trial practice. No amendment is made to rules using the term in such other contexts. Thus under Rule 227, a party need not take ‘‘exception’’ to any ruling of the trial judge. A party must still file ‘‘exceptions’’ to an auditor’s report under Rule 1530, a master’s report under Partition Rule 1569, a hearing officer’s report under Support Rule 1910.12, a master’s report under Divorce Rule 1920.55 and a schedule of distribution under Execution Rule 3136.

   Rule 227.1

   Rule 227.1 is entirely new. It includes several subjects not previously covered by the Rules of Civil Procedure.

   Subdivision (a) authorizes the court to grant post-trial relief upon motion. This provision is necessary because JARA has repealed the statutes which formerly provided that authorization. The rule specifies the relief which may be granted and does not alter the prior practice.

   Subdivision (a) prescribes the filing of a ‘‘written Motion for Post-Trial Relief’’. Motions for New Trial, for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict, and for Judgment Upon the Whole Record will no longer be filed following a trial by jury. Exceptions will no longer be filed following a trial by a judge without a jury or an equity trial. The relief heretofore available through these motions and exceptions remains available through the new Motion for Post-Trial Relief.

   Subdivision (b) states two requirements for the granting of post-trial relief. First, the grounds for the relief requested must have been raised in pre-trial proceedings or at trial and, second, they must be stated in the motion.

   Subdivision (b)(1) incorporates into the rule the principle of Dilliplaine v. Lehigh Valley Trust Co., 457 Pa. 255, 322 A.2d 114 (1974), that basic and fundamental error is not a ground for a new trial in the absence of a timely objection at the trial. The rule extends the principle to all post-trial relief. A ground for a new trial or a judgment notwithstanding the verdict may not be raised for the first time in the Motion for Post-Trial Relief. It must be raised timely in pre-trial proceedings or during the trial, thus affording the court the opportunity to correct the error.

   In Yudacufski v. Commonwealth, Department of Transportation, 499 Pa. 605, 454 A.2d 923 (1982), the Supreme Court noted that the Rules of Civil Procedure governing post-trial practice ‘‘do not specifically include a requirement that pre-trial rulings must be raised in post-trial motions in order to be preserved.’’ Subdivision (b) now contains such a provision.

   Subdivision (b)(2) specifies the requisites of the motion for post-trial relief. It must state the specific grounds for the relief sought and ‘‘how the grounds were asserted in pre-trial proceedings or at trial.’’

   In requiring the motion to state the specific grounds therefor, motions which set forth mere ‘‘boilerplate’’ language are specifically disapproved. A post-trial motion must set forth the theories in support thereof ‘‘so that the lower court will know what it is being asked to decide.’’ Frank v. Peckich, 257 Pa.Super. 561, 391 A.2d 624, 632-633 (1978).

   The requirement that the motion state how the grounds were raised at trial indicates compliance with the requirements of Dilliplaine, supra, and subdivision (b)(1) that there be a timely objection in pre-trial proceedings or at the trial.

   Under subdivision (c), the time for filing the post-trial motion remains unchanged at ten days. However, the rule also provides an instance in which the time for filing a post-trial motion may be extended beyond the initial ten day period. There are occasions when a party is displeased with the result of a trial but refrains from filing a post-trial motion unless a post-trial motion is filed by an opposing party. This strategy necessitates a close watch over the dockets, since the party will be foreclosed from filing a motion if the opposing party files its motion on the tenth day. To facilitate practice in this area, subdivision (c) provides that where a post-trial motion has been timely filed by one party, any other party has ten days following the filing of the first post-trial motion in which to file its own motion. As with the other provisions of Rule 227.1, this concept applies to jury, nonjury and equity trials.

   Subdivision (d) continues the practice of permitting a party to request post-trial relief in the alternative. When a party elects to so proceed, separate reasons should be set forth in support of each type of relief requested. Again, the document should make the trial judge aware of each request for relief and the grounds in support thereof.

   Subdivision (e) provides a rule of judicial economy when both a new trial and judgment are sought in an action. Subdivision (e) provides that the court shall dispose of both requests. Thereafter, if the action is appealed, the appellate court may make a final disposition of the matter. This provision avoids the procedural situation where a trial court grants judgment but fails to rule on the request for a new trial. The action is thereafter appealed and the appellate court must then remand for disposition of the request for new trial. Under subdivision (e), the appellate court would be able to remand the matter directly for a new trial or affirm the ruling of the lower court.

   New subdivision (f) provides for the prompt service of copies of the post-trial motion upon every other party to the action and the delivery of a copy to the trial judge.

EXPLANATORY COMMENT—1985
   The amendment of Rule 227.1(c)(2) to provide for the filing of a motion for post-trial relief within ten days after nonsuit in a non-jury or an equity trial clarifies, but does not change, existing practice. Although subdivision (c)(2) did not refer to the filing of a motion for post-trial relief after a nonsuit in those instances, subdivision (a)(3) clearly provides for the court upon a written motion to remove a nonsuit without reference to the nature of the trial. The addition of the reference to a nonsuit in subdivision (c)(2) removes any ambiguity that might arise with respect to the time in which a motion for post-trial relief must be filed following a nonsuit in a non-jury or equity trial.

EXPLANATORY COMMENT—1989
   The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has promulgated an amendment to Rule of Civil Procedure 227.1 governing post-trial relief clarifying practice under the rule in two respects. First, notes have been added to subdivisions (a) and (c) explaining the scope of the motion for post-trial relief and the range of actions and proceedings to which the motion applies. The text of these subdivisions is not changed so that practice and procedure under them remain unaffected.

   Second, new subdivision (g) is added to the rule specifying the procedure in appeals from final determinations of certain government agencies. The Commonwealth Court has stated that there are no post-trial proceedings in ‘‘statutory appeal’’ proceedings unless mandated by local rule. This practice has caused confusion in several respects. In many cases, post-trial motions have been filed unnecessarily and have resulted in the loss of the right to appeal. In other cases, attorneys have filed motions for post-trial relief and appeals simultaneously because they were unable to discern the proper procedure.

   New subdivision (g) prohibits post-trial proceedings in a statutory appeal. The decision of the court in all such cases will be a final, appealable order.

EXPLANATORY COMMENT—1995
   Amendments to the Rules of Civil Procedure relating to post-trial practice have been promulgated, allowing parties to minimize post-trial delay and clarifying the procedure with regard to proceedings in eminent domain and the actions of mandamus and partition of real property.

   I. Entry of Judgment upon Praecipe

   a. Post-Trial Delay

   Prior to the present amendment, parties to an action had no recourse when a motion for post-trial relief remained pending and undecided. The amendment to Rule 227.4 permits any party to an action to file a praecipe for judgment when a timely motion has been filed and remains undecided for more than one hundred twenty days after filing.

   The rule is optional with the parties. If settlement negotiations are continuing, they may have little interest in a prompt appeal. If time is not of the essence, they may await the decision of the trial court. However, the rule provides the parties with the ability to ‘‘move the case along.’’

   If a motion remains undecided and a praecipe for judgment is entered at the earliest permissible time, the maximum post-trial delay is one hundred thirty days, i.e., ten days in which to file the motion and one hundred twenty days in which to decide it. The potential delay inherent in Rule of Appellate Procedure 1701(b)(3) providing for reconsideration of an order is avoided by prohibiting reconsideration of the judgment. The judgment entered is effective as to all parties and all issues so that the case in its entirety is ready for the appellate process.

   The rule does not provide an automatic limit upon the time in which the court may make its ruling. However, it does provide a time standard by which the parties and the court may proceed.

   There is a rule which may operate to prevent the entry of judgment upon the expiration of the one hundred twenty day period. Rule 238(c)(3)(i) provides that if ‘‘a motion for post-trial relief has been filed under Rule 227.1 and a motion for delay damages is opposed, a judgment may not be entered until all motions filed under Rule 227.1 and this rule [Rule 238] have been decided.’’ A note has been added to call attention to the rule.

   b. Waiver of Post-Trial Practice

   A second amendment to Rule 227.4 has deleted the provision for entry of judgment upon filing a ‘‘waiver in writing of the right to file post-trial motions signed by all parties’’. Present Pennsylvania policy is to require the parties to give the trial court the opportunity to correct error through post-trial practice. It follows that post-trial practice should not be subject to waiver.

   II. Eminent Domain

   Case law had developed an inconsistent practice with respect to the filing of a post-trial motion following trial upon an appeal from the decision of viewers in eminent domain proceedings. Post-trial practice was required following a trial by jury but not after a trial by a judge without a jury. New subdivision (h) has been added to Rule 227.1 eliminating this distinction and requiring post-trial practice whether the trial be by jury or by judge.

EXPLANATORY COMMENT—1996
   The note to Rule 227.1(c) has been amended by deleting the second paragraph referring to a case stated. This amendment was required by the abolition of the case stated by Rule 1038.2.

   The amendment is technical in nature and does not affect practice or procedure.

EXPLANATORY COMMENT—2004
   Prior to the present amendment, Rule of Civil Procedure 227.1(b) was inconsistent with Pennsylvania Rule of Evidence 103(a). Civil Rule 227.1(b) required without exception that grounds for post-trial relief be raised in pre-trial proceedings or at trial. Evidence Rule 103(a), however, did not require that the specific ground for an erroneous evidentiary ruling be raised prior to or at trial if the ground was apparent from the context. The present amendment to Civil Rule 227.1 carves out an exception for matters within the scope of Evidence Rule 103(a), thereby eliminating the inconsistency between the two rules.

EXPLANATORY COMMENT—2015
   In Newman Development Group of Pottstown, LLC v. Genuardi’s Family Markets, Inc. and Safeway, Inc., 52 A.3d 1233 (Pa. 2012), the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania examined the provisions of Rule 227.1 to determine whether a party must file a motion for post-trial relief following the resolution by the trial court of matters remanded by an appellate court. While it concluded in that case that a motion for post-trial relief was not required because the remand proceeding, which relied on an existing record, was not a trial, even though the trial court drew a different conclusion from that record to comport with the appellate court’s directive, the Court held that Rule 227.1 is silent as to any procedure for post-trial relief when a matter has been remanded for further consideration by the trial court. Id. at 1251.

   To close this gap, the Supreme Court has amended Rule 227.1 by adding new subdivision (i). Specifically addressing the remand context, the amendment would not require the filing of a motion for post-trial relief following the resolution of matters remanded by an appellate court except under the following circumstances: (1) the appellate court has specified that the remand is for a complete or partial new trial, or (2) the trial court states in its order resolving the issue remanded that a motion for post-trial relief is required in order to preserve those issues for appellate review.

   The amendment is intended to give the practitioner certainty as to when a motion for post-trial relief is required in the remand context, and thus, to prevent waiver of those issues upon further appellate review. It is also intended to facilitate the underlying purpose of the rule, which is to allow the trial court to reconsider its determination and to make any corrections before it is appealed without inundating it with unnecessary motions.

   (1)  enter judgment upon a nonsuit by the court, the verdict of a jury or the decision of a judge following a trial without jury, if

     (a)   no timely post-trial motion is filed; or

     (b)   one or more timely post-trial motions are filed and the court does not enter an order disposing of all motions within one hundred twenty days after the filing of the first motion. A judgment entered pursuant to this subparagraph shall be final as to all parties and all issues and shall not be subject to reconsideration;

   Official Note

   If a motion for delay damages has been filed, judgment may not be entered until that motion is decided or otherwise resolved. See Rule 238(c)(3)(i).

   Rule 1042.72(e)(3) prohibits the entry of judgment in a medical professional liability action if a motion for post-trial relief under Rule 227.1 is pending with respect to the ground that a damage award for noneconomic loss is excessive.

   (2)  enter judgment when a court grants or denies relief but does not itself enter judgment or order the prothonotary to do so.

   Official Note

   See Rule 236 requiring the prothonotary to give notice of the entry of an order or judgment and Rule 237 requiring notice of filing of praecipe for judgment. For illustrative Rules of Civil Procedure specifically authorizing entry of judgment by the prothonotary on praecipe of a party, see Rules 1037, 1659, 3031(a), and 3146.

Rule 229.1. Settlement Funds. Failure to Deliver. Sanctions.
 (a)  As used in this rule,

   ‘‘defendant’’ means a party released from a claim of liability pursuant to an agreement of settlement;

 (b)  The parties may agree in writing to modify or waive any of the provisions of this rule.

 (c)  If a plaintiff and a defendant have entered into an agreement of settlement, the defendant shall deliver the settlement funds to the attorney for the plaintiff, or to the plaintiff if unrepresented, within twenty calendar days from receipt of an executed release.

   Official Note

   If court approval of the settlement is required, Rule 229.1 is not operative until the settlement is so approved.

   Upon receipt of the settlement funds, the plaintiff shall file a discontinuance or deliver a discontinuance to the defendant.

 (d)  If settlement funds are not delivered to the plaintiff within the time required by subdivision (c), the plaintiff may seek to

   (1)  invalidate the agreement of settlement as permitted by law, or

   (2)  a copy of the executed release,

   (3)  a copy of a receipt reflecting delivery of the executed release more than twenty days prior to the date of filing of the affidavit,

   (4)  a certification by the attorney of the applicable interest rate,

   (5)  the form of order prescribed by subdivision (h), and

   (6)  a certification by the attorney that the affidavit and accompanying documents have been served on the attorneys for all interested parties.

 (f)  Upon receipt of the affidavit and supporting documentation required by subdivision (e), the defendant shall have twenty days to file a response.

 (g)  If the court finds that the defendant violated subdivision (c) of this rule and that there is no material dispute as to the terms of the settlement or the terms of the release, the court shall impose sanctions in the form of interest calculated at the rate equal to the prime rate as listed in the first edition of the Wall Street Journal published for each calendar year for which the interest is awarded, plus one percent, not compounded, running from the twenty-first day to the date of delivery of the settlement funds, together with reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in the preparation of the affidavit.

 (h)  The affidavit shall be accompanied by an order in substantially the following form:

   Official Note

   See Section 4 of the Act, 40 P. S. §  4004, providing that the court of common pleas of the judicial district in which the payee is domiciled shall have jurisdiction over the petition.

 (c)  The parties to the petition shall be the payee and the transferee.

 (d)  The petition shall be verified by the transferee and shall contain:

   (1)  a statement setting forth the payment provisions of the structured settlement agreement and the payment rights that the payee seeks to transfer,

   (2)  separate paragraphs which in bold type set forth

     (i)   the net amount payable to the payee after deduction of all commissions, fees, costs, expenses, and charges, and

     (ii)   the following statement setting forth the interest rate:

 

   ‘‘Based on the net amount that the payee will receive from this transaction ($

     (i)   a Payee’s Affidavit in Support of Petition, in the form prescribed by subdivision (f) as Attachment 1,

     (ii)   an initial order of court scheduling the hearing, in the form prescribed by subdivision (g),

The transferee is not required to verify the information set forth in the Payee’s Affidavit.

 (e)(1) If the petition and Payee’s Affidavit in Support of Petition meet the requirements of this rule and contain factual allegations which, if established, will support the findings set forth in Section 3 of the Act, the court shall promptly enter an order scheduling a hearing date. The transferee shall give notice of the hearing, in the form prescribed by subdivision (h), to the payee, the structured settlement obligor, the annuity issuer, the payee’s spouse and any person who receives child support, alimony or alimony pendente lite from the payee.

   (2)  If the petition is denied without a hearing for failure to meet the requirements of this rule or to contain necessary factual allegations, which will support the findings set forth in Section 3 of the Act, the court shall state reasons for the denial and the payee may file an amended petition as of course.

Rule 230.1. Compulsory Nonsuit at Trial.
 (a)(1) In an action involving only one plaintiff and one defendant, the court, on oral motion of the defendant, may enter a nonsuit on any and all causes of action if, at the close of the plaintiff’s case on liability, the plaintiff has failed to establish a right to relief.

   (2)  The court in deciding the motion shall consider only evidence which was introduced by the plaintiff and any evidence favorable to the plaintiff introduced by the defendant prior to the close of the plaintiff’s case.

   (1)  all of the defendants, or

   (2)  any of the defendants who have moved for nonsuit if all of the defendants stipulate on the record that no evidence will be presented that would establish liability of the defendant who has moved for the nonsuit.

   Official Note

   The term ‘‘defendants’’ includes additional defendants.

     (ii)   there is a reasonable explanation or a legitimate excuse for the failure to file both:

       (A)   the statement of intention to proceed prior to the entry of the order of termination on the docket; and

(Caption)

NOTICE OF PROPOSED TERMINATION OF COURT CASE

 (h)  Required Status Conference. Upon receipt of a statement of intention to proceed, the court shall schedule a status conference and establish appropriate timelines to ensure a timely and efficient disposition of the case.

Comment:
   This rule provides an administrative method for the termination of inactive cases.

   Subdivision (b). If the notice mailed to an attorney is returned by the postal service, the prothonotary should check the website of the Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, www.padisciplinaryboard.org, for a current address.

   Subdivision (c). The prothonotary may not enter an order terminating the action until more than 30 days after service of the notice of proposed termination. A court officer may certify to the prothonotary those matters which have been inactive and in which no statement of intention to proceed has been filed.

   Subdivision (d). The provision under subdivision (d)(2) for filing a petition within 60 days of the entry of the order of termination on the docket is not a standard of timeliness. Rather, the filing of the petition during that time period eliminates the need to make the showing otherwise required by subdivision (d)(3). In addition, the standard in subdivision (d)(2) is not intended to set a standard for timeliness in proceedings outside this rule.

Historical Commentary
   The following commentary is historical in nature and represents statements of the Committee at the time of rulemaking:

EXPLANATORY COMMENT—2003
   The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has promulgated new Rule of Civil Procedure 230.2 governing the termination of inactive cases and amended Rule of Judicial Administration 1901. Two aspects of the recommendation merit comment.

   I. Rule of Civil Procedure

   New Rule of Civil Procedure 230.2 has been promulgated to govern the termination of inactive cases within the scope of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure. The termination of these cases for inactivity was previously governed by Rule of Judicial Administration 1901 and local rules promulgated pursuant to it. New Rule 230.2 is tailored to the needs of civil actions. It provides a complete procedure and a uniform statewide practice, preempting local rules.

   This rule was promulgated in response to the decision of the Supreme Court in Shope v. Eagle, 551 Pa. 360, 710 A.2d 1104 (1998) in which the court held that ‘‘prejudice to the defendant as a result of delay in prosecution is required before a case may be dismissed pursuant to local rules implementing Rule of Judicial Administration 1901.’’

   Rule of Judicial Administration 1901(b) has been amended to accommodate the new rule of civil procedure. The general policy of the prompt disposition of matters set forth in subdivision (a) of that rule continues to be applicable.

   II. Inactive Cases

   The purpose of Rule 230.2 is to eliminate inactive cases from the judicial system. The process is initiated by the court. After giving notice of intent to terminate an action for inactivity, the course of the procedure is with the parties. If the parties do not wish to pursue the case, they will take no action and ‘‘the prothonotary shall enter an order as of course terminating the matter with prejudice for failure to prosecute.’’ If a party wishes to pursue the matter, he or she will file a notice of intention to proceed and the action shall continue.

   a. Where the action has been terminated

   If the action is terminated when a party believes that it should not have been terminated, that party may proceed under Rule 230(d) for relief from the order of termination. An example of such an occurrence might be the termination of a viable action when the aggrieved party did not receive the notice of intent to terminate and thus did not timely file the notice of intention to proceed.

   The timing of the filing of the petition to reinstate the action is important. If the petition is filed within thirty days of the entry of the order of termination on the docket, subdivision (d)(2) provides that the court must grant the petition and reinstate the action. If the petition is filed later than the thirty-day period, subdivision (d)(3) requires that the plaintiff must make a showing to the court that the petition was promptly filed and that there is a reasonable explanation or legitimate excuse both for the failure to file the notice of intention to proceed prior to the entry of the order of termination on the docket and for the failure to file the petition within the thirty-day period under subdivision (d)(2).

   b. Where the action has not been terminated

   An action which has not been terminated but which continues upon the filing of a notice of intention to proceed may have been the subject of inordinate delay. In such an instance, the aggrieved party may pursue the remedy of a common law non pros which exists independently of termination under Rule 230.2.

EXPLANATORY COMMENT—2015
   In 2014, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania made efforts to reduce the inventory of civil cases on the dockets of the Courts of Common Pleas. To expedite that process, it suspended Rule 230.2 governing the termination of inactive cases. Originally adopted in 2003, Rule 230.2 implemented the general policy provisions of Rule of Judicial Administration 1901(a) governing the prompt disposition of matters and the termination of inactive cases. While Pa.R.J.A. No. 1901(a) provided general guidelines for conducting an administrative purge, Rule 230.2 set forth a procedural mechanism for a court to perform an administrative purge of cases that had remained on the civil docket for two or more years with no evidence of any activity.

   The Court has amended and reinstated Rule 230.2. The amendments have streamlined the procedure for the trial court to conduct an administrative purge of inactive cases, and are intended to ensure that the civil dockets reflect the current inventory of active cases, while encouraging attorneys to expeditiously litigate their cases.

   Several concerns with the suspended Rule 230.2 were identified. The suspended rule did not specify how often a court should conduct an administrative purge; it only provided a procedure should a court decide to conduct an administrative purge. In order to ensure that the civil case inventory is accurate, the amendment of subdivision (a) requires a court to conduct an administrative purge at least once a year. The court is also required to report such information to the Court Administrator of Pennsylvania with a form supplied by the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts.

   A second problem identified with suspended Rule 230.2 was the provision for service of the notice of proposed termination in subdivision (b). In subdivision (b)(1), the suspended rule required service of the notice of proposed termination on counsel of record or unrepresented parties at least sixty days prior to the date of termination. To expedite the process, the amendment of subdivision (b)(1) shortens that time frame and require the notice to be served to at least thirty days prior to the date of termination.

   The suspended rule did not provide for modern, efficient methods for giving notice to counsel or unrepresented parties that cases were identified as having no activity on the docket for the previous two years. Subdivision (b)(2) of the suspended rule provided for the notice to be served by mail pursuant to Rule 440 at the last address of record. In the event that the notice was returned, publication was required in the legal publication designated by the court for such notices. In conjunction with the shortened time frame in subdivision (b)(1), the amendment of subdivision (b)(2) updates the method for giving notice by allowing the notice to be served electronically pursuant to Rule 205.4 governing electronic filing. The ability to serve notice by mail pursuant to Rule 440 has been retained, but publication in the legal journal when a notice has been returned has been eliminated.

   A third problem identified with suspended Rule 230.2 was the filing of statements of intention to proceed in order to keep a case active, but then not requiring any further obligation on counsel or an unrepresented party to move the case forward to resolution. Subdivision (c) of the suspended rule required an attorney or unrepresented party to file a statement of intention to proceed before the termination date stated in the notice in order to prevent the purging of the case from the docket. If no statement of intention to proceed was filed, the prothonotary was directed to enter an order terminating the matter for failure to prosecute. In the newly amended rule, this provision has been retained. However, new subdivision (h) encourages the trial court to manage its cases by scheduling a status conference and establishing appropriate timelines to insure a timely and efficient disposition of the case.

   Importantly, the amendment of Rule 230.2 retains the post-termination procedure set forth in subdivision (d) of the suspended rule, which allows a party to petition the court to reinstate the action. The suspended rule provided certain requirements for reinstatement depending whether the petition is filed within thirty days or beyond thirty days. While the requirements remain unchanged, subdivision (d) has been amended to provide for sixty days rather than thirty days. New subdivision (e), however, limits reinstatements of a case. If any case, previously reinstated, is terminated pursuant to this rule, then it is terminated with prejudice. No additional reinstatements will be granted. This provision is intended to encourage the efficient litigation of cases and to not let them languish on the docket.

Rule 234.1. Subpoena to Attend and Testify.
 (a)  A subpoena is an order of the court commanding a person to attend and testify at a particular time and place. It may also require the person to produce documents or things which are under the possession, custody or control of that person.

   Official Note

   See Discovery Rule 4009.1 et seq. for a request upon a party and a subpoena upon a person not a party for the production of documents and things other than a deposition or a trial.

   The twenty-day notice requirement of Rule 4009.21(a) is not applicable to a subpoena issued under Rule 234.1 in connection with a deposition. The provision of Rule 4007.1(d)(2) thatmaterials subpoenaed in connection with a deposition ‘‘shall be produced at the deposition and not earlier, except upon the consent of all parties to the action,’’ serves the same purpose as the notice requirement under Rule 4009.21(a).

 (b)  A subpoena may be used to command a person to attend and to produce documents or things only at

   (1)  a trial or hearing in an action or proceeding pending in the court, or

   (2)  the taking of a deposition in an action or proceeding pending in the court.

 (c)  A subpoena may not be used to compel a person to appear or to produce documents or things ex parte before an attorney, a party or a representative of the party.

 (d)  A subpoena shall be served reasonably in advance of the date upon which attendance is required.

 (d) A court may compel the attendance of any person confined in jail or prison by issuing, upon motion, an order directed to the custodian of the person so confined to release the person to the custody of a sheriff or other appropriate agent.

 (e)(1)  For the purposes of this subdivision, ‘‘guardian’’ shall mean any parent, custodian, or other person who has legal custody of a minor, or person designated by the court to be a temporary guardian for purposes of a proceeding.

   (2)(i)  Except as provided by subdivision (ii), if a witness is a minor, a copy of the subpoena shall be served upon the minor and the guardian of the minor within the Commonwealth by an adult in the manner prescribed in subdivision (b).

Rule 236. Notice by Prothonotary of Entry of Order or Judgment.
 (a)  The prothonotary shall immediately give written notice of the entry of

   (1)  a judgment entered by confession to the defendant by ordinary mail together with a copy of all documents filed with the prothonotary in support of the confession of judgment. The plaintiff shall provide the prothonotary with the required notice and documents for mailing and a properly stamped and addressed envelope; and

   (2)  any other order or judgment to each party’s attorney of record or, if unrepresented, to each party. The notice shall include a copy of the order or judgment.

   Official Note

   See Rules 1012 and 1025 as to the requirement of an address on an appearance and a pleading.

 (b)  The prothonotary shall note in the docket the giving of the notice and, when a judgment by confession is entered, the mailing of the required notice and documents.

 (c)  Failure to give the notice or when a judgment by confession is entered to mail the required documents, or both, shall not affect the lien of the judgment.

 (d)  The prothonotary may give the notice required by subdivision (a) or notice of other matters by facsimile transmission or other electronic means if the party to whom the notice is to be given or the party’s attorney has filed a written request for such method of notification or has included a facsimile or other electronic address on a prior legal paper filed in the action.

   Official Note

   Except as provided by subdivision (a)(1) relating to the entry of a judgment by confession, Rule 236 does not prescribe a particular method of giving notice. Methods of notice properly used by the prothonotary include, but are not limited to, service via United States mail and courthouse mail. Subdivision (d) governs facsimile transmission and other electronic means if the prothonotary chooses to use such a method.

   A facsimile or other electronic address set forth on letterhead is not a sufficient basis under this rule to authorize the prothonotary to give notice electronically.

   Notice by facsimile transmission or other electronic means is applicable not only to orders and judgments under subdivision (a) but also to ‘‘other matters’’ such as the scheduling of a conference, hearing or trial or other administrative matters. Where the technology involved provides an acknowledgment for the mailing or the receipt of the notice, the prothonotary should retain that acknowledgment as part of his or her file.

   See Rule 205.4 governing filling and service of legal papers by electronic means other than facsimile transmission.

   See Rule 440(d) governing service of legal papers other than original process by facsimile transmission.

Rule 237.1. Notice of Praecipe for Entry of Judgment of Non Pros for Failure to File Complaint or by Default for Failure to Plead.
 (a)  As used in this rule,

   ‘‘judgment of non pros’’ means a judgment entered by praecipe pursuant to Rules 1037(a) and 1659;

   Official Note

   When a defendant appeals from a judgment entered in a magisterial district court, Pa.R.C.P.M.D.J. 1004(b) authorizes the appellant to file a praecipe for a rule as of course upon the appellee to file a complaint or suffer entry of a judgment of non pros. The entry of the judgment of non pros is governed by Pa.R.C.P. No. 1037(a) and is subject to this rule.

   ‘‘judgment by default’’ means a judgment entered by praecipe pursuant to Rules 1037(b), 1511(a), 3031(a) and 3146(a).

   (2)  No judgment of non pros for failure to file a complaint or by default for failure to plead shall be entered by the prothonotary unless the praecipe for entry includes a certification that a written notice of intention to file the praecipe was mailed or delivered:

     (i)   in the case of a judgment of non pros, after the failure to file a complaint and at least ten days prior to the date of the filing of the praecipe to the party’s attorney of record or to the party if unrepresented, or

     (ii)   in the case of a judgment by default, after the failure to plead to a complaint and at least ten days prior to the date of the filing of the praecipe to the party against whom judgment is to be entered and to the party’s attorney of record, if any.

 The ten-day notice period in subdivision (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(ii) shall be calculated forward from the date of the mailing or delivery, in accordance with Pa.R.J.A. 107.

   Official Note

   The final sentence of Rule 237.1(a)(2) alters the practice described in the decision of Williams v. Wade, 704 A.2d 132 (Pa. Super. 1997).

   (3)  A copy of the notice shall be attached to the praecipe.

   (4)  The notice and certification required by this rule may not be waived.

   Official Note

   A certification of notice is a prerequisite in all cases to the entry by praecipe of a judgment of non pros for failure to file a complaint or by default for failure to plead to a complaint. Once the ten-day notice has been given, no further notice is required by the rule even if the time to file the complaint or to plead to the complaint has been extended by agreement.

   See Rule 237.4 for the form of the notice of intention to enter a judgment of non pros and Rule 237.5 for the form of the notice of intention to enter a judgment by default.

 (b)  This rule does not apply to a judgment entered

   (1)  by an order of court,

   (2)  upon praecipe pursuant to an order of court, or

   (3)  pursuant to a rule to show cause.

   Official Note

Rule 237.3. Relief from Judgment of Non Pros or by Default.
 (a)  A petition for relief from a judgment of non pros or by default entered pursuant to Rule 237.1 shall have attached thereto a copy of the complaint, preliminary objections, and/or answer which the petitioner seeks leave to file. All grounds for relief shall be raised in a single petition.

 (b)(1) If the petition is filed within ten days after the entry of a judgment of non pros on the docket, the court shall open the judgment if the proposed complaint states a meritorious cause of action.

   (2)  If the petition is filed within ten days after the entry of a default judgment on the docket, the court shall open the judgment if one or more of the proposed preliminary objections has merit or the proposed answer states a meritorious defense.

   Official Note

   Rule 236 requires the prothonotary to give notice of the entry of any judgment and to note in the docket the giving of the notice.

   The petitioner must act with reasonable diligence to see that the petition is promptly presented to the court if required by local practice.

   See Schultz v. Erie Insurance Exchange, 477 A.2d 471 (Pa. 1984) for the requirements for opening a judgment by default and Rule 3051 as to a judgment of non pros. Rule 237.3 does not change the law of opening judgments. Rather, the rule supplies two of the three requisites for opening such judgments by presupposing that a petition filed as provided by the rule is timely and with reasonable explanation or legitimate excuse for the inactivity or delay resulting in the entry of the judgment. The requirement of this rule for proceeding within ten days is not intended to set a standard for timeliness in circumstances outside this rule.

   See Rules 206.1 through 206.7 governing petition practice.

Explanatory Comment—1994
   Rule 237.3 governs relief from a judgment by default or of non pros. Subdivision (a) requires that a copy of the complaint, preliminary objections, or answer sought to be filed be attached to the petition for relief from the judgment. This enables the court to determine from the actual complaint, preliminary objections, or answer to be filed whether the complaint alleges a meritorious cause of action, one or more of the preliminary objections has merit, or the answer alleges a meritorious defense.

   Subdivision (b) eases the burden of a party against whom judgment has been entered and who ment of non pros within ten days after entry of the judgment on the docket, the rule requires the court to open the judgment if the proposed complaint states a meritorious cause of action. If the petitioner files a petition for relief from a default judgment within ten days after entry of the judgment on the docket, the rule requires the court to open the judgment if one or more of the proposed preliminary objections has merit or the proposed answer states a meritorious defense. The rule provides a date certain from which to measure the ten-day period and the language establishing the beginning of that period is derived from Rule 1308 governing appeals in compulsory arbitration.

   Case law has imposed three requirements for opening a judgment by default: a petition timely filed, a reasonable explanation or legitimate excuse for the inactivity or delay and a showing of a meritorious defense. Rule of Civil Procedure 3051 similarly states these three requisites for opening a judgment of non pros, substituting the showing of a meritorious cause of action rather than a meritorious defense. Rule 237.3(b) presumes that a petition filed within the required ten-day period is both timely and with reasonable explanation or legitimate excuse for the inactivity or delay. In this context, subdivision (b) requires that the judgment be opened if the petitioner attaches to the petition a complaint which states a meritorious cause of action, one or more preliminary objections which has merit, or an answer which states a meritorious defense. A note to the rule cautions that the rule is not intended to change the law relating to the opening of judgments in any way or to impose a new standard of timeliness in cases outside the limited circumstances set forth in the rule.moves promptly for relief from that judgment. If the petitioner files a petition for relief from a judge

   Illustrations

   In illustrations 1 through 3, the defendant has failed to plead within the required time to a complaint containing a notice to plead.

   1. Prior to receiving a notice of intention to enter a default judgment, defendant seeks an agreement with the plaintiff for an extension of time in which to plead. The parties may certainly agree to an extension of time and proceed in accordance with their agreement. However, such an agreement is really unnecessary since the plaintiff cannot enter judgment without giving the ten-day notice required by the rule and the ten-day notice cannot be waived. Defendant may plead within the time up to the date of mailing or delivery of the notice plus ten days. This period of time may be more than might be provided by any agreement. In addition, there is no danger of a judgment being entered as the required notice has not been given.

   2. Defendant has received the ten-day notice but cannot file the pleading within the ten-day period. Now, as provided by Rule 237.2, it is appropriate to seek an agreement to extend the time in which to plead since the plaintiff has given the notice which is prerequisite to the entry of judgment and actual entry of the judgment is imminent.

   3. Defendant has received the ten-day notice and obtained an agreement extending the time to plead. However, defendant does not plead within the agreed time. Plaintiff may enter judgment by default without further notice as provided by Rule 237.2 and the form of agreement set forth in Rule 237.6.

   In illustrations 4 and 5, the plaintiff has entered a valid judgment by default against the defendant and the prothonotary has entered the judgment in the docket and noted the date thereof. Thereafter, the defendant files a petition to open the judgment.

   4. The defendant files the petition to open the judgment within ten days of the date on which the prothonotary entered the judgment on the docket and seeks leave to file the answer attached to the petition. The defendant is entitled to the benefit of Rule 237.3(b)(2) by timely filing the petition and attaching an answer. Rule 237.3(b)(2) requires the court to open the judgment upon the defendant demonstrating to the court that the filing of the petition was within the ten-day period and that the answer attached to the petition states a meritorious defense.

   5. The defendant files a petition to open the judgment more than ten days after the date of entry of the judgment on the docket. The petition to open is not within the scope of Rule 237.3(b) which requires that the petition be ‘‘filed within ten days after the entry of the judgment on the docket’’. The defendant must proceed pursuant to case law and meet the standards of Schultz v. Erie Insurance Exchange, 477 A.2d 471 (Pa. 1984).

   Although these illustrations use the example of the entry of a judgment by default and a petition to open the judgment, they are adaptable and thus equally applicable to the entry of a judgment of non pros for failure to file a complaint and a petition to open such a judgment.

Explanatory Comment—2010
   The 1994 Explanatory Comment to Rule 237.3 provides several illustrations of the application of the rule. A discrepancy exists between Illustration 1 and Rule 237.1(a)(2)(ii) governing notice of praecipe to enter judgment of non pros or by default. The 1994 Explanatory Comment provides that the defendant may plead within the time of receiving the notice of praecipe plus ten days. Rule 237.1(a)(2)(ii) states that the ten-day period shall be calculated forward from the date of the mailing or delivery of the notice. The 1994 Explanatory Comment has been amended to conform with the text of Rule 237.1(a)(2)(ii).

Explanatory Comment—2019
   In 2016, Rule 237.3 was amended by adding preliminary objections as a type of pleading that may be attached to a petition for relief from a default judgment. By allowing the use of preliminary objections, the 2016 amendment was intended to give a defendant the same right to file a responsive pleading after the entry of a default judgment that is afforded to him or her prior to entry of a default judgment. In practice, however, litigants have interpreted this provision to permit the filing of a petition for relief with proposed preliminary objections attached, and then, when that petition is denied, to then file an additional petition for relief by attaching the proposed answer, notwithstanding the requirement that a petition for relief must be filed within 10 days of the entry of a default judgment. To promote procedural efficiency, Rule 237.3 has been amended to require a litigant to raise all grounds for relief in a single petition.

Rule 238. Damages for Delay in an Action for Bodily Injury, Death or Property Damage.
 (a)(1) At the request of the plaintiff in a civil action seeking monetary relief for bodily injury, death or property damage, damages for delay shall be added to the amount of compensatory damages awarded against each defendant or additional defendant found to be liable to the plaintiff in the verdict of a jury, in the decision of the court in a nonjury trial or in the award of arbitrators appointed under section 7361 of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. §  7361, and shall become part of the verdict, decision or award.

   (2)  Damages for delay shall be awarded for the period of time from a date one year after the date original process was first served in the action up to the date of the award, verdict or decision.

The cost of the entire structured settlement must remain the same while the terms of the payment may vary and have to be recalculated at the time of acceptance due to market fluctuation over the ninety-day period during which the offer must remain open.

   (3)  The plaintiff’s recovery required by subdivision (b)(1)(i), whether by award, verdict or decision, exclusive of damages for delay, shall not be more than 125 percent of either the specified sum or the cost of the structured settlement plus any cash payment to the plaintiff.

 (c) Not later than ten days after the verdict or notice of the decision, the plaintiff may file a written motion requesting damages for delay and setting forth the computation. The motion shall begin with the following notice:

   

  NOTICE
 You are hereby notified to file a written answer to the attached motion for delay damages within twenty days from the filing of the motion or the delay damages sought in the motion may be added to the verdict or decision against you.

   (1)  Within twenty days after the motion is filed, the defendant may answer specifying the grounds for opposing the plaintiff’s motion. The averments of the answer shall be deemed denied. If an issue of fact is raised, the court may, in its discretion, hold a hearing before entering an appropriate order.

   Official Note

   An order of the court on the motion for delay damages shall not be subject to a motion for post-trial relief.

   (2)  If the defendant does not file an answer and oppose the motion, the prothonotary upon praecipe shall add the damages for delay to the verdict or decision in the amount set forth in the motion.

   (3)(i)  If a motion for post-trial relief has been filed under Rule 227.1 and a motion for delay damages is pending, a judgment may not be entered until disposition has been made of all motions filed under Rule 227.1 and this rule.

     (ii)   If no motion for post-trial relief is filed within the ten-day period under Rule 227.1 but the defendant opposes the motion for delay damages, the plaintiff may enter judgment on the verdict or decision. Thereafter, upon deciding the motion for damages for delay, the court shall enter judgment for the amount of the delay damages, if any.

 (d)(1)  In an action heard by a board of arbitrators on which damages for delay are requested, at least twenty days prior to the hearing the plaintiff shall notify the defendant of the intention to request delay damages and the date from which they are to be calculated. A defendant who objects to the request shall submit to the plaintiff within ten days prior to the hearing a statement setting forth the objections and whether

     (i)   the defendant made an offer in writing and, if so, the amount and the date of the offer; and

     (ii)   there was a period of time during which delay of the arbitration hearing was attributable to the plaintiff. Each party shall submit to the board at the hearing a sealed envelope containing the plaintiff’s request and the defendant’s statement. Immediately upon making an award, the board of arbitrators shall review the contents of the envelopes and add damages for delay, if any, to the award. If the defendant opposes the request, the board may hold a hearing on the issue of damages for delay and shall immediately thereafter determine the amount of damages for delay, if any. Damages for delay shall be separately stated in the report and award of the arbitrators.

   Official Note

   This rule contemplates that the board of arbitrators will make its award immediately upon conclusion of the hearing and that it will then proceed to consider the issue of damages for delay.

 (e)  This rule shall not apply to

   (1)  eminent domain proceedings;

See 29 Pa.B. 4859 (September 18, 1999).)

Rule 401. Time for Service. Reissuance, Reinstatement, and Substitution of Original Process.
 (a)  Original process shall be served within the Commonwealth within 30 days after the issuance of the writ or the filing of the complaint.

   Note

   See Rule 404 for the time for service outside the Commonwealth.

 (b)(1)  If service within the Commonwealth is not made within the time prescribed by subdivision (a) of this rule or outside the Commonwealth within the time prescribed by Rule 404, the prothonotary upon praecipe and upon presentation of the original process, or a copy thereof, shall continue its validity by designating the writ as reissued or the complaint as reinstated.

   (2)  A writ may be reissued or a complaint reinstated at any time and any number of times. A new party defendant may be named in a reissued writ or a reinstated complaint only if the writ or complaint has not been served on any defendant.

   Note

   A new party defendant cannot be added to a reissued writ or reinstated complaint if service has been completed on a defendant already named in the writ or complaint. For cases involving multiple defendants, a new party defendant cannot be added to a reissued writ or reinstated complaint if service has been completed on any defendant already named in the writ or complaint.

   If a new party defendant cannot be added pursuant to this rule, other procedures are available. See Rule 229 to discontinue the action and to start a new action; Rule 1033 to amend the caption of a pleading by agreement of the party or by leave of court; and Rule 2232 to seek leave of court for an order joining a defendant.

   (3)  A substituted writ may be issued or a substituted complaint filed upon praecipe stating that the former writ or complaint has been lost or destroyed.

   (4)  A reissued, reinstated, or substituted writ or complaint shall be served within the applicable time prescribed by subdivision (a) of this rule or by Rule 404 after reissuance, reinstatement, or substitution.

   (5)  If an action is commenced by writ of summons and a complaint is thereafter filed, the plaintiff, instead of reissuing the writ, may treat the complaint as alternative original process and as the equivalent for all purposes of a reissued writ, reissued as of the date of the filing of the complaint. Thereafter the writ may be reissued, or the complaint may be reinstated as the equivalent of a reissuance of the writ, and the plaintiff may use either the reissued writ or the reinstated complaint as alternative original process.

   Note

   If the applicable time has passed after the issuance of the writ or the filing of the complaint, the writ must be reissued or the complaint reinstated to be effective as process. Filing or reinstatement or substitution of a complaint, which is used as alternative process under this subdivision, has been held effective in tolling the statute of limitations as the reissuance or substitution of a writ.

   See Lamp v. Heyman, 469 Pa. 465, 366 A.2d 882 (1976), with respect to original process as a means of tolling the statute of limitations, wherein the Court stated that original process ‘‘shall remain effective to commence an action only if the plaintiff then refrains from a course of conduct which serves to stall in its tracks the legal machinery he has just set in motion.’’

SERVICE UPON PARTICULAR PARTIES

Rule 420. Minors.
 When the defendant is a minor, original process shall be served

   (1)  upon the minor in the manner prescribed for the service of original process upon an adult defendant, or

   (2)  by handing a copy to the minor’s guardian.

   Official Note

   Rule 76 defines ‘‘minor’’ and Rule 2026 defines ‘‘guardian.’’ The plaintiff cannot obtain a valid judgment against the minor until a guardian has been appointed; and a judgment obtained without the appointment of a guardian may be vacated and a guardian appointed forthwith, in accordance with Rule 2034. In all instances, the court in appointing a guardian for a minor may require that the guardian be served with copies of the pleadings already served upon the minor or others and may also grant such continuance as is necessary to prepare and present the case of the minor. The court may also make orders extending the time for filing pleadings on behalf of the minor.

SERVICE PURSUANT TO SPECIAL ORDER OF COURT

Rule 430. Service Pursuant to Special Order of Court. Publication.
 (a)  If service cannot be made under the applicable rule the plaintiff may move the court for a special order directing the method of service. The motion shall be accompanied by an affidavit stating the nature and extent of the investigation which has been made to determine the whereabouts of the defendant and the reasons why service cannot be made.

   Official Note

   A sheriff’s return of ‘‘not found’’ or the fact that a defendant has moved without leaving a new forwarding address is insufficient evidence of concealment. Gonzales v. Polis, 357 A.2d 580 (Pa. Super. 1976). Notice of intended adoption mailed to last known address requires a ‘‘good faith effort’’ to discover the correct address. Adoption of Walker, 360 A.2d 603 (Pa. 1976).  An illustration of a good faith effort to locate the defendant includes (1) inquiries of postal authorities including inquiries pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 39 C.F.R. Part 265, (2) inquiries of relatives, neighbors, friends, and employers of the defendant, (3) examinations of local telephone directories, courthouse records, voter registration records, local tax records, and motor vehicle records, and (4) a reasonable internet search.

   See Rule 1064 for additional requirements for service of original process by publication for actions to quiet title involving subsurface mineral, oil, or natural gas rights.

 (b)(1)  If service of process by publication has been authorized by rule of civil procedure or order of court, the publication shall be by advertising a notice of the action once in the legal publication, if any, designated by the court for the publication of legal notices and in one newspaper of general circulation within the county. The publication shall contain the caption of the action and the names of the parties, state the nature of the action, and conclude with a notice substantially in the following form:

NOTICE

 

   If you wish to defend, you must enter a written appearance personally or by attorney and file your defenses or objections in writing with the court. You are warned that if you fail to do so the case may proceed without you and a judgment may be entered against you without further notice for the relief requested by the plaintiff. You may lose money or property or other rights important to you.

   YOU SHOULD TAKE THIS PAPER TO YOUR LAWYER AT ONCE. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A LAWYER, GO TO OR TELEPHONE THE OFFICE SET FORTH BELOW. THIS OFFICE CAN PROVIDE YOU WITH INFORMATION ABOUT HIRING A LAWYER.

   Official Note

   The office shall be that designated by the court under Rule 1018.1(c).

   (2)  When service is made by publication upon the heirs and assigns of a named former owner or party in interest, the court may permit publication against the heirs or assigns generally if it is set forth in the complaint or an affidavit that they are unknown.

   The provisions of this Rule 1901 adopted March 9, 1977, effective April 10, 1977, 7 Pa.B. 839; amended March 30, 1994, effective July 1, 1994, 24 Pa.B. 1943; amended March 9, 1998, effective July 1, 1998, 28 Pa.B. 1391; amended May 2, 2006, effective May 9, 2006, 36 Pa.B. 2369; amended October 19, 2021, effective January 1, 2022, 51 Pa.B. 6764. Immediately preceding text appears at serial pages (390067) to (390068).

Rule 1901.1. Venue.
 (a)  Except as provided in subdivision (b), an action for protection from abuse may be brought in a county in which

   (1)  the plaintiff resides, either temporarily or permanently, or is employed, or

   (2)  the defendant may be served, or

   (3)  the abuse occurred.

 (b)  If the relief sought includes possession of the residence or household to the exclusion of the defendant, the action shall be brought only in the county in which the residence or household is located.

 (c)  An action for indirect criminal contempt may be filed in, and heard by, the court in the county in which the order was issued or where the violation occurred.

Explanatory Comment—1991
   The statute and rules governing actions for protection from abuse formerly contained no provision for venue. Recommendation No. 84 of the Civil Procedural Rules Committee proposed a new rule to fill that void and the rule has been adopted as Rule 1901.1.

   Subdivision (a) provides for venue in the following counties: (1) the county in which the abuse occurred, (2) the county in which the defendant may be served, (3) the county in which the plaintiff resides, either permanently or temporarily, and (4) the county in which the plaintiff is employed. These are the counties with which the plaintiff has the most significant contacts and the greatest interest in remaining free from abuse. The county of temporary residence is included because an abused person may have to flee the county of permanent residence to escape further abuse.

   The rule imposes limited venue when the relief sought includes the sole possession of the residence or household. In that instance, the action must be brought in the county in which the residence or household is located.

Explanatory Comment—2006
   The 2005 amendments to the Protection From Abuse Act grant jurisdiction over indirect criminal contempt complaints in either the county in which the order was issued or the county where the violation occurred. This rule allows for flexible and immediate enforcement of protection from abuse orders. With this amendment, indirect criminal contempt jurisdiction is parallel to prosecution for stalking and harassment. 23 Pa.C.S.A. §  6114 (a.1).

   The provisions of this Rule 1901.2 adopted March 9, 1998, effective July 1, 1998, 28 Pa.B. 1391.

Rule 1901.3. Commencement of Action.
 (a)  Except as provided in subdivision (b), a plaintiff shall commence an action by presenting to the court or filing with the prothonotary a petition setting forth the alleged abuse by the defendant. The petition shall be substantially in the form set forth in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1905(b) and shall have as its first page the Notice of Hearing and Order set forth in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1905(a).

 (b)  An action may be commenced by filing with the prothonotary a certified copy of an emergency order entered pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S. §  6110, including orders issued by a hearing officer.

 (c)  Any fees associated with this action shall not be charged to the plaintiff.

 (d)  The hearing officer shall follow the procedures set forth in the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure Governing Actions and Proceedings Before Magisterial District Judges for emergency relief under the Protection From Abuse Act.

   Official Note

   See Pa.R.C.P. No. 1930.1(b). This rule may require attorneys or unrepresented parties to file confidential documents and documents containing confidential information that are subject to the Case Records Public Access Policy of the Unified Judicial System of Pennsylvania.

Immediately preceding text appears at serial page (392601).

Rule 1901.4. Service and Registration of Order.
 (a)  Service of the petition and temporary order shall be in accordance with Rule 1930.4.

 (b)  An Affidavit of Service substantially in the form set forth in Rule 1905(d) shall be filed with the prothonotary.

 (c)  Upon the filing of a protection order with the prothonotary, the prothonotary shall transmit a copy of the order to the State Police PFA Registry in the manner prescribed by the Pennsylvania State Police.

   Official Note

   This provision also applies to an order denying a plaintiff’s request for a final protection order.

 (d)  No fee shall be charged to the plaintiff or petitioner for service of any protection from abuse order or pleading or for the registration, filing or service of any foreign protection order.

Explanatory Comment—1997
   Subdivision (c) reflects the prothonotary’s role in ensuring that all protection orders reach the new statewide PFA Registry. Pursuant to the 1994 amendments to the Protection From Abuse Act, the Pennsylvania State Police Department is mandated to establish this registry for all protection orders issued or registered in the Commonwealth. Once it becomes fully operational, it will be available at all times to inform law enforcement officers, dispatchers and courts of the existence and terms of protection orders. The Registry represents a major improvement in the manner in which protection orders are registered and verified by not only eliminating the need to register the order in every county where the victim believes enforcement is necessary, but also enabling the police to immediately verify the order for purposes of enforcement. In order to ensure that the information in the Registry remains current, subdivision (c) requires the prothonotary to transmit all protection orders issued or registered in the Commonwealth, including temporary, final, modified and consent orders as well as any orders withdrawing, extending or denying the plaintiff’s request for a protection order.

Explanatory Comment—2006
   New subdivision (d) reflects the prohibition against charging fees to the plaintiff, even those related to foreign protection orders, as set forth in the 2005 amendments to the Protection From Abuse Act. 23 Pa.C.S.A. §  6106(b) and (g.1).

When the complaint is filed by a police officer or sheriff, neither the plaintiff’s presence nor signature is required.

 (b)  If an arrest is not effected, a complaint for indirect criminal contempt may be completed and signed by the plaintiff pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S.A. §  6113.1.

Explanatory Comment—2006
   The 2005 amendments to the Protection From Abuse Act authorize the sheriff to arrest the defendant for violations of a protection from abuse order. In addition, the sheriff is authorized to exercise a search and seizure of any firearm, other weapon and ammunition subsequent to arrest. 23 Pa.C.S.A. §  6113(a) and (b).

Rule 1901.7. Decision. Post-trial Relief.
 (a)  The decision of the court may consist of only general findings of abuse but shall dispose of all claims for relief. The court’s final order shall be rendered substantially in the form set forth in Rule 1905(e).

 (b)  No motion for post-trial relief may be filed to the final order.

   Official Note

   The procedure relating to Motions for Reconsideration is set forth in Rule 1930.2.

 (c)  If a final protection from abuse order directs the defendant to pay support to the plaintiff for the benefit of the plaintiff and/or a child, the plaintiff must file a complaint for support with the domestic relations section within two weeks of the date of the order or the support provisions of the order shall lapse automatically. If the plaintiff timely files with the domestic relations section, the support provisions of the final protection from abuse order shall remain in effect until a support order is entered.

 (d)  The custody provisions of a Protection From Abuse order are temporary. Either party may initiate custody proceedings pursuant to the custody statute at 23 Pa.C.S. §  5321 et seq. Any valid custody order entered after the final Protection From Abuse order supersedes the custody provisions in paragraph 5 of the Protection From Abuse order.

Explanatory Comment—1977
   New Rules 1901, et seq. promulgated March 9, 1977 and effective 15 days after publication in the Pennsylvania Bulletin implement the Protection From Abuse Act No. 218 of 1976 which became effective December 6, 1976.

   The Act introduces a new civil remedy authorizing protective orders to bring about cessation of abuse of the plaintiff or minor children, which relief includes, inter alia, exclusion of the errant spouse from the household, the award of temporary custody and visitation rights with regard to minor children and support.

   The Act also authorizes temporary ex parte orders when the exigency of the situation requires immediate relief before process can be served on a defendant.

   Jurisdiction is also conferred on the magisterial district judges over the weekend if and when a judge of the court of common pleas is not available, but any temporary order of a magisterial district judge expires at the resumption of business of the common pleas court at the beginning of the week or within seventy-two (72) hours, whichever occurs first. The magisterial district judge is required immediately to certify his or her order to the common pleas court and the certification under the Act has the effect of commencing a proceeding in the common pleas court and invoking the other provisions of the Act.

   Section 9 of the Act provides that all proceedings shall be in accordance with Rules of Civil Procedure and shall be in addition to any other available civil or criminal remedies.

Explanatory Comment—2005
   Act 207-2004 amended numerous titles of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes changing the title of ‘‘district justice’’ to ‘‘magisterial district judge.’’ The amendments to Rule 1901.7’s Explanatory Comment—1977 reflect the change in title, make the comment gender-neutral and delete outdated material.

Rule 1901.8. Modification or Discontinuance.
 (a)  In cases in which a temporary protection order has not yet been granted or has been denied, a plaintiff in a protection from abuse action who wishes to discontinue the action may file a praecipe to discontinue, pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. 229, prior to the final order hearing. The party may also request the discontinuance by oral motion at a hearing.

 (b)  In cases in which a temporary protection order has been granted, a plaintiff in a protection from abuse action who wishes to vacate the temporary order and discontinue the action shall either file a petition with the court prior to the final order hearing or make the request by oral motion at the final order hearing.

 (c)  If either party seeks a modification after a final judgment has been entered in a protection from abuse action, the party shall petition the court to modify the final order. The court shall enter an order granting or denying the petition following an appearance by the petitioner before the court.

Explanatory Comment—2013
   Jurisdictions across the commonwealth have adopted varying procedures and processes for the withdrawal, discontinuance and modification of protection from abuse actions. This rule provides a uniform process that comports with the requirements of 23 Pa.C.S. § §  6107(b)(2) (related to hearings), 6117 (related to procedure and other remedies) and Commonwealth v. Charnik, 921 A.2d 1214 (Pa. Super. 2007). These requirements, when read together, require a different procedure for withdrawal, discontinuance and modification at various stages in a protection from abuse proceeding.

   After a final protection order is entered, and no motion to reconsider or appeal is filed, the court no longer retains jurisdiction to vacate that order. Charnik, 921 A.2d at 1217. The court does, however, have jurisdiction to modify a protection from abuse order at any time after the filing of a petition for modification, service of the petition and a hearing on the petition. 23 Pa.C.S. §  6117. Thus, a party may request that the court modify the order to expire at an earlier date if the party does not want the order to remain in effect.

 Note: Space is provided to allow for 1) the court’s general findings of abuse; 2) inclusion of the terms under which the order was entered (e.g., that the order was entered with the consent of the parties, or that Defendant, though properly served, failed to appear for the hearing, or the reasons why the plaintiff’s request for a final PFA order was denied); or 3) information that may be helpful to law enforcement (e.g., whether a firearm or other weapon was involved in the incident of abuse or whether Defendant is believed to be armed and dangerous).

  Plaintiff’s request for a final protection order is denied.

 OR

  Plaintiff’s request for a final protection order is granted.

  1. Defendant shall not abuse, stalk, harass, threaten, or attempt or threaten to use physical force against Plaintiff or any other protected person in any place where they might be found.

 Defendant may relinquish any firearms, other weapons, or ammunition to the sheriff or the appropriate law enforcement agency. As an alternative, Defendant may either relinquish firearms, other weapons, or ammunition to a third party provided Defendant and the third party first comply with all the requirements to obtain a safekeeping permit, or relinquish firearms, other weapons, or ammunition to a licensed firearms dealer for consignment sale, lawful transfer, or safekeeping pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S. §  6108.2(e). Defendant must relinquish any firearm, other weapon, ammunition, or firearm license ordered to be relinquished no later than 24 hours after service of this order.

The amount of this temporary order does not necessarily reflect Defendant’s correct support obligation, which shall be determined in accordance with the guidelines at the support hearing. Any adjustments in the final amount of support shall be credited, retroactive to this date, to the appropriate party.

 11.  (a) The costs of this action are imposed on Defendant.
 (b) Because this order followed a contested proceeding, or a hearing at which Defendant was not present, despite being served with a copy of the petition, temporary order and notice of the date, time and place of the hearing, Defendant is ordered to pay an additional $100 surcharge to the court, which shall be distributed in the manner set forth in 23 Pa.C.S. §  6106(d).

Explanatory Comment—1997
   The use of standardized forms provides uniformity and is also critical to the enforcement of protection orders both inside and outside of the commonwealth. These forms are substantially based on those proposed by members of the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence and have been further refined to accommodate the litigants’ need for simplicity, the court’s need for flexibility and law enforcements’ need for certain identifying information necessary to enforce the protection order.

   The forms must be used so that all protection orders can be properly registered with the statewide PFA Registry and the federal Protection Order File (POF) established by the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) for the collection of information that is necessary for nationwide enforcement of protection orders. Entering a protection order into the Registry and NCIC file enables law enforcement to immediately verify the existence and terms of the order. It is important, therefore, that all protection orders be registered with these two files. To this end, the forms capture all of the information that is required for data entry and the form orders are further structured to present that information in the order and sequence that is most helpful to the various law enforcement agencies responsible for entering the information into the files. Once the information reaches the Registry and is accepted by the NCIC file, it becomes immediately accessible to law enforcement agencies, dispatchers and courts throughout the country.

   The provisions in the form petition and orders reflect the most common forms of relief available under the Protection From Abuse Act. Plenty of space, however, is provided for the plaintiff to request additional relief, and for courts to fashion appropriate relief, based on the individual circumstances of the litigants. Since all of the provisions will not necessarily apply in every case, the forms adopt a checkbox method that requires the user to affirmatively check only those provisions which are applicable to his or her situation.

   In cases where a provision is generally applicable but its terms do not correspond precisely to the relief being requested or granted, the user should not check the standard provision but instead should use the blank spaces provided in the forms to specify the relief. For example, while the final order contains a standard provision permitting the defendant to retrieve personal belongings only in the company of a police officer, there may be more suitable methods of retrieval available in some cases. If so, then the plaintiff or court should use the blank spaces provided in the form petition or order (rather than the standard provision) to specify the alternative manner of retrieval.

Explanatory Comment—2000
   Paragraph 2 of the final order has been amended to enable courts to include additional conditions for the retrieval of personalty by the defendant in a section of the final order which permits arrest without a warrant if the conditions are violated. Paragraph 9 of the final order has been amended to require the filing of a support complaint within two weeks, rather than fifteen days, of the entry of a final order under the Protection From Abuse Act to prevent the automatic lapse of any temporary support provisions included in the order. This change is consistent with the statutory provisions at 23 Pa.C.S.A. §  6108(a)(5).

Explanatory Comment—2006
   The Notice to Defend in subdivision (a) was amended to include three notice requirements of the 2005 Protection From Abuse Act amendments, Act 66 of 2005. 23 Pa.C.S.A. §  6107 (a). The amendments provide that sheriffs may arrest defendants for violations of protective orders. The notice also advises the defendant that if firearms, other weapons or ammunition cannot reasonably be retrieved within the required time, the defendant must provide the sheriff with an affidavit listing the firearms, other weapons and ammunition and their current location within 24 hours. Pa.C.S.A. §  6108(a)(7)(i)(B). In addition, defendants have the option to turn firearms, other weapons and ammunition over to a qualified third party instead of the sheriff, and federal firearms prohibitions and penalties are more clearly stated.

   The 2005 amendments to the Protection From Abuse Act require several changes to the form petition at subdivision (b). The plaintiff is required to inform the court if the defendant works in a job that requires the handling of firearms. This provision was included to allow courts to exercise appropriate discretion when a defendant is exempt from federal firearm prohibitions and penalties. It also directs the court to ‘‘make a reasonable effort to preserve the financial assets of the defendant’s business while fulfilling the goals’’ of the Protection From Abuse Act. 23 Pa.C.S.A. §  6108(a)(7.1). Federal law prohibits possession of firearms and penalizes defendants who possess them if they are subject to an order prohibiting abuse, stalking or harassment. However, certain law enforcement officials are exempt from this prohibition and penalty. Under 18 U.S.C. §  925(a)(1), a person performing an official duty on behalf of the federal, state or local law enforcement agency may possess a firearm as long as the officer is required to possess the firearm in his or her official capacity. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms requires the official possession of the firearm to be authorized by statute, regulation or official department policy. The new notice requirement is found in 23 Pa.C.S.A. §  6106 (a.2).

   Paragraph 14 of the form petition was amended to address the manner in which the firearms and other weapons were used against the plaintiff or minor children and to remove the listing of firearms in the petition itself. The amended statute prohibits public access to any list or inventory of the defendant’s firearms, other weapons or ammunition. Thus, a separate Attachment A is included at the end of the petition for purposes of listing the firearms, other weapons and ammunition at issue. This will allow the prothonotary to more easily redact the list from public access, while at the same time permitting the court, the parties and law enforcement agencies to enforce the order. 23 Pa.C.S.A. §  6108 (a)(7)(v). Section 6108(a)(7) of the Protection From Abuse Act provides for relinquishment of other weapons and ammunition only if they have been used or threatened to be used in an act of abuse. Paragraph 14 and Attachment A to Petition balance the court’s need to be advised of firearms, other weapons and ammunition used or threatened to be used in an act of abuse or available to the defendant with the plaintiff’s right to decline to seek relinquishment of some or all of those firearms, other weapons and ammunition.

   The form petition also was amended to address the court’s authority to order the defendant to relinquish any and all firearms, whether they were used or threatened to be used in an act of abuse or not. Any one of several circumstances authorizes the court to grant this relief, including, but not limited to, abuse involving a firearm or weapon or an immediate and present danger of abuse. The amended statute provides the court with multiple examples of what may constitute proof of immediate and present danger for the purposes of ordering the relinquishment of any or all of the defendant’s firearms. 23 Pa.C.S.A. §  6107(b)(3). Finally, the form addresses the court’s authority to order the defendant to relinquish other weapons and ammunition which were used or threatened to be used in an act of abuse.

   The form temporary order retains a space for the defendant’s Social Security number. Pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S.A. §  6108(b), ‘‘[a]ny order issued under this section shall, where furnished by either party, specify the Social Security number and date of birth of the defendant.’’

   In subdivisions (c) and (e), paragraph three in the form temporary and final orders is amended to clarify that even indirect contact with a protected person may be prohibited. This clarification reflects the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s holding in Commonwealth v. Baker, 564 Pa. 192, 766 A.2d 328 (2001), that the order must be ‘‘definite, clear, specific and leave no doubt or uncertainty in the mind of the person to whom it was addressed of the prohibited conduct.’’

   The amendments to paragraph five of the form temporary and final orders are consistent with the statutory provisions of the Protection From Abuse Act relating to custody. See 23 Pa.C.S.A §  6108(a)(4).

   The 2005 amendments to the Protection From Abuse Act provide that the court may order the defendant to relinquish ammunition and firearm licenses, in addition to firearms and other weapons. 23 Pa.C.S.A. §  6108(a)(7) and 7.1. These items were added to paragraph six of the temporary and final order forms, the notices to the defendant and the notices to the sheriff, police and law enforcement.

   The amendments to paragraph six of the form orders also provide the court with discretion to place certain restrictions on firearms possession or to completely proscribe firearms possession. The amended paragraphs and the notices to the defendant inform the parties that if the defendant is ordered to relinquish firearms, weapons or ammunition, they must be relinquished to the sheriff or, in the alternative, they may be relinquished to a third party who complies with the substantive and procedural requirements for a third party safekeeping permit. 23 Pa.C.S.A. § §  6107(a), 6108.3. Upon entry of a final order, the defendant may also relinquish firearms, other weapons or ammunition to a licensed firearms dealer. No matter which option Defendant chooses, if firearms and weapons are ordered to be relinquished, any firearm license ordered to be relinquished must be relinquished to the sheriff. The aforementioned items may be relinquished at the time of service, but no later than 24 hours after service unless, with regard to firearms, other weapons or ammunition, they cannot reasonably be retrieved due to their location. 23 Pa.C.S.A. §  6108 (a)(7)(i). The notice to the defendant in the final order was expanded to advise the defendant that violation of the order may result in the revocation of the third-party safekeeping permit.

   Paragraph seven of the final order form was amended to reflect 23 Pa.C.S.A. §  6108.1(a) and other statutory provisions concerning the return of firearms.

   Paragraph ten of the final order form was amended to reflect the statute’s prohibition against charging the plaintiff fees or costs related to filing, service, registration or appeal in any Protection From Abuse matter. A new subparagraph (b) in paragraph ten of the final order reflects the 2005 amendments to the Protection From Abuse Act which increased the surcharge a court may order a defendant to pay when an action is contested and directs the disbursement of the collected surcharges. 23 Pa.C.S.A. §  6106(d).

   Paragraph fourteen of the final order form was amended to reflect the increased period of protection the court may grant. The maximum period of protection was increased from eighteen months to three years.

   The amended notice to the sheriff, police and law enforcement in the final order clarifies that the defendant may be arrested anywhere a violation occurs, and that the court has jurisdiction to hear the issue of indirect criminal contempt either where the order was issued or where the violation occurred. With this amendment, jurisdiction for indirect criminal contempt is parallel to prosecution for stalking and harassment. 23 Pa.C.S.A. §  6114(a.1). The notice also makes it clear that a search and seizure of firearms may occur without a warrant when incident to arrest. 23 Pa.C.S.A. §  6113(b) and 6121.

   Other amendments to the order forms reflect that the sheriff is authorized to arrest for violations of the order under the Protection From Abuse Act. 23 Pa.C.S.A. §  6113. The references to a protective order superseding provisions of a prior custody order were moved to paragraph five, which deals with custody, in both the temporary and final orders.

Explanatory Comment—2008
   The Protection From Abuse petition form, temporary order form and final order form are being modified to conform to the model template used in Project Passport. Project Passport was designed to improve recognition and enforcement of protection orders within and between states and tribes by encouraging states and tribes to adopt a recognizable first page for protection orders. Use of the model template is supported by the National Center for State Courts and the National American Indian Court Judges Association.

   The critical aspects of the model template for the first page are common data elements jointly identified by multi-disciplinary teams. Using a recognizable first page for protection orders with this essential data readily available and easily recognizable on a protection order, particularly on ‘‘foreign protection orders,’’ helps strengthen the safety net for domestic violence survivors and their children by offering greater consistency in the issuance and enforcement of protection orders.

   Implementation of the model first page for Project Passport requires several changes to the Pennsylvania Protection From Abuse petition, temporary order and final order forms. The petition form caption, as well as the plaintiff’s or filer’s name, relationship to the plaintiff, names and dates of birth of the protected persons, plaintiff’s address, defendant’s address, social security number, place of employment, and age, were moved to the Project Passport first page. The petition paragraphs are also renumbered. On the temporary order and final order forms, the captions and the defendant’s name, date of birth and social security number, as well as the names of the plaintiff and protected persons and dates of birth, were moved to the Project Passport first page. The Project Passport first page for the petition and temporary and final orders all include physical identifiers for the defendant and an indication if weapons were involved, present on the property or relinquished. The first page of the final order also includes the effective and expiration dates of the protection order and the notice to the defendant.

   The provisions of these Rules 1910.1—1910.31 adopted April 23, 1981, effective July 22, 1981, 11 Pa.B. 1625, unless otherwise noted.

Rule 1910.1. Scope. Definitions.
 (a)  Except as provided by subdivision (b), the rules of this chapter govern all civil actions or proceedings brought in the court of common pleas to enforce a duty of support, or an obligation to pay alimony pendente lite.

   Official Note

   A duty of support is imposed by the following statutes: 23 Pa.C.S.A. §  4321 and Section 3 of the Support Law of June 24, 1937, P. L. 2045, 62 P. S. §  1973 (repealed) now Act 43-2005, July 7, 2005, P. L. 196. The procedure under the rules of this chapter implements Chapter 43 of Part V of the Domestic Relations Code, Title 23 of the Consolidated Statutes, 23 Pa.C.S.A. §  4301 et seq., relating to support proceedings. The procedure under these rules provides an alternative to the intrastate and interstate procedures under Parts VIII and VIII-A of the Domestic Relations Code, 23 Pa.C.S.A. § §  7101 et seq. and 8101 et seq. For alimony and alimony pendente lite, see Sections 3701 and 3702 of the Divorce Code, 23 Pa.C.S.A. § §  3701, 3702.

   Official Note

   Long arm jurisdiction is available in support actions brought pursuant to these rules per 23 Pa.C.S.A. §  4342(c).

 (b) The rules of this chapter shall not govern

   (1)  an action or proceeding for support based upon a contract or agreement which provides that it may not be enforced by an action in accordance with these rules,

   (2)  an application for a temporary order of support and other relief pursuant to the Protection from Abuse Act of December 19, 1990, P. L. 1240, No. 206, 23 Pa.C.S. §  6101 et seq. or

   (3)  an action for support of an indigent brought pursuant to Chapter 46 of the Domestic Relations Code, 23 Pa.C.S.A. §  4601 et seq.

   Official Note

   Where a contract or agreement provides that it cannot be enforced in accordance with the rules, actions upon a contract or agreement for support are to be heard by the court and not a conference officer or hearing officer under Rules 1910.11 or 1910.12. However, such actions should be expedited and given preference in court listings.

 (c)  As used in this chapter, unless the context of a rule indicates otherwise, the following terms shall have the following meanings:

   ‘‘Conference officer,’’ the person who conducts an office conference pursuant to Rule 1910.11.

   ‘‘Hearing officer,’’ the person who conducts a hearing on the record and makes recommendations to the court pursuant to Rule 1910.12.

   ‘‘Overdue support,’’ the amount of delinquent support equal to or greater than one month’s support obligation which accrues after entry or modification of a support order as the result of obligor’s nonpayment of that order.

   ‘‘Past due support,’’ the amount of support which accrues prior to entry or modification of a support order as the result of retroactivity of that order. When nonpayment of the order causes overdue support to accrue, any and all amounts of past due support owing under the order shall convert immediately to overdue support and remain as such until paid in full.

   ‘‘Suspend,’’ eliminate the effect of a support order for a period of time.

   ‘‘Terminate,’’ end not only the support order, but the support obligation as well.

   ‘‘Trier-of-fact,’’ the judge, hearing officer, or conference officer who makes factual determinations.

   ‘‘Vacate,’’ declare a particular support order null and void, as if it were never entered.

Explanatory Comment—1994
   Nothing in this rule should be interpreted to eliminate the distinctions between spousal support and alimony pendente lite which are established by case law.

   Alimony pendente lite must be distinguished from permanent alimony for purposes of this rule. The rule applies only to alimony pendente lite. The procedure for obtaining permanent alimony is governed by Section 3702 of the Divorce Code, 23 Pa.C.S.A. §  3702, and Rules of Civil Procedure 1920.1 et seq. Agreements for alimony approved by the court in connection with actions for divorce under Section 3701 of the Divorce Code are deemed to be court orders enforceable under Section 3703 of the Code.

   Section 3105(a) of the Divorce Code provides that all agreements relating to matters under the code, whether or not merged or incorporated into the decree, are to be treated as orders for purposes of enforcement unless the agreement provides otherwise. Subdivision (b)(1) is amended to conform to the statute.

   There is considerable diversity in the terminology used throughout the rules, and in the various counties, to describe the individuals who conduct conferences and hearings pursuant to the support rules. The addition of subdivision (c) to the rules standardizes terminology and eliminates the confusion which results from individual counties using inconsistent terms to refer to persons performing the same function. All references in the rules to conference or hearing officers have been amended to conform to the terminology set forth in subdivision (c).

   In an effort to further standardize the terminology used in support matters, the additional terms are defined.

Explanatory Comment—2000
   Act 1998-127 technically amended Act 1997-58 to define and differentiate between past due and overdue support to clarify that only overdue support constitutes a lien by operation of law against the obligor’s real or personal property. 23 Pa.C.S.A. §  4302 now defines overdue support as ‘‘support which is delinquent under a payment schedule established by the court.’’ Past due support is defined as ‘‘support included in an order of support which has not been paid.’’

   The definitions of past due and overdue support in this rule do not substantively change the legislative definitions. They merely elaborate on them in terms which are more familiar and helpful to the bench and bar. Specifically, past due support consists of the purely retroactive arrearages which accumulate between the date of the filing of the complaint or petition for modification and the date of the hearing and entry of the initial or modified support order. Overdue support refers to the delinquent arrearages which accrue after entry of the order due to the obligor’s failure to pay support pursuant to the order.

   These definitions are important for determining the remedies available for collecting support arrearages. Pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S.A. §  4352(d), only overdue support (delinquent arrearages) constitutes a lien by operation of law against the obligor’s property. Conversely, past due support (retroactive arrears) does not operate as a lien against this property as long as the obligor remains current on the support order.

   Rule 1910.20 extends this legislative distinction between overdue and past due support to the following remedies available to collect support: (1) consumer agency reporting under 23 Pa.C.S.A. §  4303; (2) suspension of licenses under 23 Pa.C.S.A. §  4355; and (3) the full range of new collection remedies under 23 Pa.C.S.A. §  4305(b)(10). Accordingly, these remedies are available only to collect overdue support. They are not available to collect past due support as long as the obligor remains current on the order. If, however, the obligor subsequently defaults on the support order, Rule 1910.20(c) provides that any past due support still owing under the order immediately becomes overdue support subject to the full range of collection remedies. It remains overdue support until collected in full.

   Pursuant to Rule 1910.20(c), all overdue support, including past due support which has converted to overdue support, remains subject to Act 58 remedies until paid in full. Any repayment plan subsequently agreed to by the parties, or ordered by the court pursuant to a contempt proceeding (including any arrearage component), does not preclude the use of these remedies for collecting overdue support more quickly, whenever feasible.

   In cases involving past due support only, the obligee is not entirely without remedy in the event that additional income or assets of the obligor are discovered after the hearing which would enable collection of past due support more quickly. In these cases, identification of those income sources or assets provides a basis for modification pursuant to Rule 1910.19. Modification includes increasing the rate of repayment on past due support and, if appropriate, ordering that the past due support be paid in full. In these cases, the obligee may also petition the court for special relief pursuant to Rule 1910.26 to have the income or assets frozen and seized pending the petition for modification in order to secure payment of past due support.

Explanatory Comment—2007
   Act 43-2005, July 7, 2005, P. L. 196, repealed the Act of June 24, 1937 (P. L. 2045, No. 397), known as The Support Law and added Chapter 46 to the Domestic Relations Code, 23 Pa.C.S.A. §  4601 et seq. Section 4 of Act 43-2005 states that the addition of Chapter 46 is a continuation of the Act of June 24, 1937 (P. L. 2045, No. 397). Chapter 46 addresses the responsibility of certain family members to maintain indigent relatives, whether or not the indigent person is a public charge. New subdivision (b)(3) clarifies that the support rules and guidelines do not apply to actions brought under Chapter 46 of the Domestic Relations Code.

   The provisions of this Rule 1910.1 amended November 7, 1988, effective January 1, 1989, 18 Pa.B. 5326; amended March 30, 1994, effective July 1, 1994, 24 Pa.B. 1953; amended April 15, 1994, effective July 1, 1994, 24 Pa.B. 2296; amended December 8, 1994, effective July 1, 1995, 24 Pa.B. 6399; amended May 31, 2000, effective July 1, 2000, 30 Pa.B. 3155; amended February 2, 2007, effective February 3, 2007, 37 Pa.B. 522; amended August 17, 2021, effective January 1, 2022, 51 Pa.B. 5539. Immediately preceding text appears at serial pages (395598) and (364529) to (364531).

Rule 1910.2. Venue. Transfer of Action.
 (a)  An action may be brought in

   (1)  the county in which the defendant resides, or

   (2)  the county in which the defendant is regularly employed, or

   (3)  the county in which the plaintiff resides and that county is the county in which the last marital domicile was located and in which the plaintiff has continued to reside.

   (4)  the county in which the child resides if the relief sought includes child support.

   Official Note

   If an action for support is brought in the county in which the plaintiff resides but that county is not the county in which the last family domicile was located and in which the plaintiff has continued to reside, the action shall proceed in accordance with the Revised Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (1968), 23 Pa.C.S. §  4501 et seq. if the defendant is outside the Commonwealth, or in accordance with 23 Pa.C.S. §  4533 which provides for intrastate application of RURESA if the defendant is within the Commonwealth, and not in accordance with these Rules.

 (b) Where jurisdiction is acquired over the defendant pursuant to the long arm statute, 23 Pa.C.S. §  4342(c), the action may be brought in the county where the plaintiff resides.

   Official Note

   23 Pa.C.S. §  7201 sets forth the specific bases for long arm jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant.

 (c)  If, at the time of the filing of the action, there is a divorce or custody action pending between the parties in an appropriate court in another county, the court upon good cause shown may transfer the support action to that county.

 (d)  For the convenience of the parties and witnesses the court may transfer an action to the appropriate court of any other county where the action could have been brought at the time of transfer.

   Official Note

   The standards for transfer of an action for the convenience of parties and witnesses are the same as the standards under Rule 1006(d).

 (e)  A support order may be enforced in accordance with the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act, 23 Pa.C.S. §  7101 et seq., if the defendant resides outside the Commonwealth, or in accordance with the Intrastate Family Support Act, 23 Pa.C.S. §  8101 et seq., if the defendant resides in another county within the Commonwealth.

   The provisions of this Rule 1910.2 amended June 20, 1985, effective January 1, 1986, 15 Pa.B. 2452; amended November 7, 1988, effective January 1, 1989, 18 Pa.B. 5326; amended December 8, 1994, effective July 1, 1995, 24 Pa.B. 6399; amended December 18, 1998, effective January 1, 1999, 29 Pa.B. 16; amended October 31, 2002, effective immediately, 32 Pa.B. 5632. Immediately preceding text appears at serial pages (267729) to (267730).

Rule 1910.2-1. Procedures Pursuant to the Intrastate Family Support Act.
 (a)  The court in the county in which the complaint for support is filed shall retain and process the case for so long as all of the following conditions are met:

   (1)  there is proper venue pursuant to Rule 1910.2;

   (2)  the defendant-obligor’s mailing address is known;

   (3)  sufficient information is known about the defendant-obligor’s employment to enable the court to issue an earnings subpoena; and

   (4)  the obligee consents.

   Official Note

   A support action should be maintained in the county in which the obligee and/or the child(ren) reside and should not involve a second county unless the county of residence is unable to obtain service on the defendant-obligor or obtain information regarding the defendant-obligor’s employment. However, the obligee is permitted to request that the case proceed under the Intrastate Family Support Act (IFSA) in accordance with 23 Pa.C.S. §  8103.

   If the venue requirements are met, the court in the obligee’s county of residence should attempt to retain the case if there already is an order in that county against the same defendant-obligor in this or another child/spousal support case or if the defendant-obligor is incarcerated.

 (b)  If courts in two or more counties must be involved in the establishment and enforcement of an obligation for support:

   (1)  the case must proceed pursuant to the Intrastate Family Support Act; and

   (2)  venue shall follow the defendant-obligor in order to maintain the availability of statutory enforcement remedies.

 (c)  A support order shall not be registered in another county unless:

   (1)  requested by the obligee, or

   (2)  necessary to maintain an order for support, to obtain payment of the support obligation or to consolidate multiple cases involving the same defendant-obligor.

 (d)  Only one support order shall be charging against a defendant-obligor for the same spouse and/or child(ren) at one time.

Rule 1910.3. Parties. Obligor. Obligee.
 (a)  An action may be brought

   (1)  by a person, including a minor parent or a minor spouse, to whom a duty of support is owing, or

   (2)  on behalf of a minor child by a person having custody of the child, without appointment as guardian ad litem, or

   (3)  on behalf of a minor child by a person caring for the child regardless of whether a court order has been issued granting that person custody of the child, or

   (4)  by a public body or private agency having an interest in the case, maintenance or assistance of a person to whom a duty of support is owing, or

   (5)  by a parent, guardian or public or private agency on behalf of an unemancipated child over eighteen years of age to whom a duty of support is owing, or.

   (6)  by any person who may owe a duty of support to a child or spouse. If the person to whom a duty of support may be owed does not appear, the action may be dismissed without prejudice for the petitioner to seek further relief from the court.

 (b)  The trier of fact shall enter an appropriate order based upon the evidence presented, without regard to which party initiated the support action, filed a modification petition or filed a petition for recovery of support overpayment. The determination of which party will be the obligee and which will be the obligor will be made by the trier of fact based upon the respective incomes of the parties, consistent with the support guidelines and existing law, and the custodial arrangements at the time of the initial or subsequent conference, hearing or trial. If supported by the evidence, the party named as the defendant in the initial pleading may be deemed to be the obligee, even if that party did not file a complaint for support. The provisions of this subdivision do not apply to parties seeking spousal support or alimony pendente lite. Parties seeking spousal support or alimony pendente lite must assert a claim in an appropriate pleading with proper notice served upon the other party.

   (1)  In general, the party who has primary custody of the children shall be the obligee of a child support order.

   (2)  When the parties share custody of the children equally, the party with the higher income shall be the obligor as provided in Rule 1910.16-4(c)(2).

Explanatory Comment—1999
   New subdivision (c) incorporates 23 Pa.C.S. §  4341(b) to confer standing on any person who is caring for a child to seek support on behalf of that child even though there is no court order granting legal or physical custody to that person. The statutory provision effectively overrules Larson v. Diveglia, 549 Pa. 118, 700 A.2d 931 (1997), which held to the contrary.

   Subdivision (e) is amended to eliminate the requirement of consent when the child is over 18 years of age. This requirement was originally intended only for applicable child support actions for higher educational support, which actions were abolished by Curtis v. Kline, 542 Pa. 249, 666 A.2d 265 (1995). This rule also is intended to apply to children who are unemancipated by reason of physical or mental disability, consistent with 23 Pa.C.S. §  4321(3) as interpreted by case law.

Explanatory Comment—2011
   A new category has been added in subdivision (a) to allow a party who may not have primary custody of the parties’ child or who may owe a duty of support to a spouse to initiate a support action in which an appropriate order may be entered. In some cases, the obligor may want to start paying spousal support or alimony pendente lite to the obligee as soon as possible to avoid the accumulation of retroactive arrears, but §  71 of the Internal Revenue Code provides that payments to a spouse or ex-spouse must be pursuant to an order or a divorce or separation instrument to receive alimony tax treatment. Thus, any payments made prior to the entry of a support order will not be deductible by the obligor. This provision is intended to allow an obligor to commence the process by which he or she may pay support earlier.

   A new subdivision (b) has been added to clarify that in all initial and subsequent child support actions, the trier of fact may enter a support order against either party, without regard to which party filed the complaint or petition for modification. This facilitates judicial economy, and relieves the parties from incurring additional filing fees, losing time from work or family, losing retroactivity and having to wait for a new proceeding to be scheduled. It enables the trier of fact to base the order on the facts and circumstances at the time of the proceeding, which may be different than at the time of filing.

Explanatory Comment
   In accordance with Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.10, a judicial district may opt for one of two procedures for support matters; the procedure selected is then certified by the president judge or administrative judge to the Domestic Relations Procedural Rules Committee as prescribed in subdivision (b). Subdivision (b) was added in response to requests from appellate court judges who find that it is often difficult to determine the rule with which the actual support procedure is intended to comply. Subsequently, a judicial district may, at any time, change its support procedure by filing a new certification with the staff of the Domestic Relations Procedural Rules Committee indicating the rule according to which support matters will proceed. However, a judicial district may, by local rule, permit interstate actions to proceed directly to a hearing officer or judge without a conference.

   The procedure set forth in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.11 provides for a conference before a conference officer, a conference summary and entry of an interim order for support calculated in accordance with the guidelines, and a right to demand a hearing de novo before a judge. The hearing must be held and the final order entered within 60 days of the written demand for hearing.

   The alternate procedure, as set forth in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.12, provides for a conference before a conference officer, a record hearing before a hearing officer, and issuance of a report and recommendation to which exceptions may be filed within ten days. The court must hear argument and enter a final order within 60 days of the filing of exceptions.

   In lieu of continuing the practice of including in the Note a 67-county list identifying the hearing procedure selected by the local county court, the list can now be found on the Domestic Relations Procedural Rules Committee website.

Explanatory Comment—1994
   The domestic relations office conference provided by Rule 1910.11 constitutes the heart of the support procedure. There are two primary advantages to the inclusion of a conference. First, in many cases the parties will agree upon an amount of support and a final order will be prepared, to be entered by the court, thus dispensing with a judicial hearing. Second, those cases which do go to hearing can proceed more quickly because the necessary factual information has already been gathered by the conference officer.

   Subdivision (a)(2) prohibits certain officers of the court from practicing family law before fellow officers of the same court. These officers are the conference officer who is an attorney (Rule 1910.11), the hearing officer (Rule 1910.12), and the standing or permanent master who is employed by the court (Rule 1920.51). The amendments are not intended to apply to the attorney who is appointed occasionally to act as a master in a divorce action.

   Subdivision (e)(3) makes clear that even if the parties agree on an amount of support, the conference officer is still empowered to recommend to the court that the agreement be disapproved. This provision is intended to protect the destitute spouse who might out of desperation agree to an amount of support that is unreasonably low or which would in effect bargain away the rights of the children. The officer’s disapproval of the agreement serves to prevent an inadequate order being entered unwittingly by the court.

   The provision for an interim order in subdivision (f) serves two purposes. First, it ensures that the obligee will receive needed support for the period during which the judicial determination is sought. Second, it eliminates the motive of delay in seeking a judicial determination.

   Because the guidelines are income driven, the trier of fact has little need for the expense information required in the Income and Expense Statement. Therefore in guideline cases, the rule no longer requires that expense information be provided. If a party feels that there are expenses so extraordinary that they merit consideration by the trier of fact, that party is free to provide the information. In cases decided according to Melzer v. Witsberger, 505 Pa. 462, 480 A.2d 991 (1984), living expenses are properly considered, and therefore must be presented on the Income and Expense Statement.

Explanatory Comment—1995
   Rule 1910.11(e) is amended to eliminate the need for a party to request a copy of the conference summary.

   Because the court is required to enter a guideline order on the basis of the conference officer’s recommendation, there is no need for (g)(2), which provided for a hearing before the court where an order was not entered within five days of the conference. It is eliminated accordingly.

   Pursuant to subdivision (g), support payments are due and owing under the interim order which continues in effect until the court enters a final order after the hearing de novo. The provision for an interim order serves two purposes. First, it ensures that the obligee will receive needed support for the period during which the judicial determination is sought. Second, it eliminates the motive of delay in seeking a judicial determination. Therefore, the plaintiff and the dependent children are not prejudiced by allowing the court sixty days, rather than the original forty-five, in which to enter its final order.

Explanatory Comment—2006
   The time for filing a written demand for a hearing before the court has been expanded from ten to twenty days. The purpose of this amendment is to provide ample opportunity for litigants and counsel to receive notice of the entry of the order, to assure commonwealth-wide consistency in calculation of time for filing and to conform to applicable general civil procedural rules.

   The amendments reflect the separated Income Statement and Expense Statements in Rule 1910.27(c).

Explanatory Comment—2010
   When the parties’ combined net income exceeds $30,000 per month, calculation of child support, spousal support and alimony pendente lite shall be pursuant to Rule 1910.16-3.1. Rule 1910.16-2(e) has been amended to eliminate the application of Melzer v. Witsberger, 505 Pa. 462, 480 A.2d 991 (1984), in high income child support cases.

Explanatory Comment—2011
   The rule has been amended to require that income information be provided in all cases, unless both parties are represented in reaching an agreement, so that a guidelines calculation can be performed. The guidelines create a rebuttable presumption that the amount calculated pursuant to them is the correct amount, so there should be a calculation in every case. If parties agree to receive or to pay an order other than the guideline amount, they should know what that amount is so that they can enter an agreement knowingly. If both parties are represented by counsel, it is assumed that their entry into the agreement for an amount other than a guidelines amount is knowing as it is counsels’ responsibility to advise the parties. In addition, part of the mandatory quadrennial review of the support guidelines mandates a study of the number of cases in which the support amount ordered varies from the amount that would result from a guidelines calculation. Federal regulations presume that if a large percentage of cases vary from the guideline amount, then the guidelines are not uniform statewide.

 (b)  Conference Conclusion.

   (1)  At the conclusion of a conference attended by both parties, if an agreement for support has not been reached, and the conference and hearing are not scheduled on the same day, the court, without hearing the parties, shall enter an interim order calculated in accordance with the guidelines and substantially in the form set forth in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.27(e), and the parties shall be given notice of the date, time and place of a hearing. A record hearing shall be conducted by a hearing officer who must be a lawyer.

   (2)  If either party, having been properly served, fails to attend the conference, the court may enter an interim order calculated in accordance with the guidelines and substantially in the form set forth in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.27(e). Within 20 days after the date of receipt or the date of mailing of the interim order, whichever occurs first, either party may demand a hearing before a hearing officer. If no hearing is requested, the order shall become final.

   (3)  Any lawyer serving as a hearing officer employed by, or under contract with, a judicial district or appointed by the court shall not practice family law before a conference officer, hearing officer, or judge of the same judicial district.

   Official Note

   Conference officers preside at office conferences under Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.11. Hearing officers preside at hearings under Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.12. The appointment of a hearing officer to hear actions in divorce or for annulment of marriage is authorized by Pa.R.C.P. No. 1920.51.

 (c)  Separate Listing.

   (1)  Except as provided in subdivision (c)(2), promptly after the conference’s conclusion, a party may move the court for a separate listing of the hearing if:

     (i)   there are complex questions of law, fact or both;

     (ii)   the hearing will be protracted; or

     (iii)   the orderly administration of justice requires that the hearing be listed separately.

   (2)  When the conference and hearing are scheduled on the same day, all requests for separate listing shall be presented to the court at least seven days prior to the scheduled court date.

   (3)  If the motion for separate listing is granted, discovery shall be available in accordance with Pa.R.C.P. No. 4001 et seq.

   Official Note

   The rule relating to discovery in domestic relations matters generally is Pa.R.C.P. No. 1930.5.

 (d)  The hearing officer shall receive evidence, hear argument and, not later than 20 days after the close of the record, file with the court a report containing a recommendation with respect to the entry of an order of support. The report may be in narrative form stating the reasons for the recommendation and shall include a proposed order substantially in the form set forth in Rule 1910.27(e) stating:

   (1)  the amount of support calculated in accordance with the guidelines;

   (2)  by and for whom it shall be paid; and

   (3)  the effective date of the order.

 (e)  The court, without hearing the parties, shall enter an interim order consistent with the proposed order of the hearing officer. Each party shall be provided, either in person at the time of the hearing or by mail, with a copy of the interim order and written notice that any party may, within twenty days after the date of receipt or the date of mailing of the order, whichever occurs first, file with the domestic relations section written exceptions to the report of the hearing officer and interim order.

   Official Note

   Objections to the entry of an interim order consistent with the proposed order may be addressed pursuant to Rule 1910.26.

 (f)  Within twenty days after the date of receipt or the date of mailing of the report by the hearing officer, whichever occurs first, any party may file exceptions to the report or any part thereof, to rulings on objections to evidence, to statements or findings of facts, to conclusions of law, or to any other matters occurring during the hearing. Each exception shall set forth a separate objection precisely and without discussion. Matters not covered by exceptions are deemed waived unless, prior to entry of the final order, leave is granted to file exceptions raising those matters. If exceptions are filed, any other party may file exceptions within twenty days of the date of service of the original exceptions.

 (g)  If no exceptions are filed within the twenty-day period, the interim order shall constitute a final order.

 (h)  If exceptions are filed, the interim order shall continue in effect. The court shall hear argument on the exceptions and enter an appropriate final order substantially in the form set forth in Rule 1910.27(e) within sixty days from the date of the filing of exceptions to the interim order. No motion for post-trial relief may be filed to the final order.

Explanatory Comment—1995
   Language is added to subdivision (b) to acknowledge that the conference and hearing can be held on the same day, and to provide for the immediate entry of an interim order in judicial districts where the hearing occurs at a later date. New subdivision (b)(2) permits entry of a guideline order after a conference which the defendant, though properly served, fails to attend. New subdivision (c)(2) is intended to prevent delays in the hearing of complex cases by requiring that requests for separate listing be made at least seven days in advance where the conference and hearing are scheduled on the same day.

   In addition, the phrase ‘‘record hearing’’ in subdivision (a) replaces the reference to a ‘‘stenographic record’’ in recognition of the variety of means available to create a reliable record of support proceedings.

   Amended subdivision (e) allows an interim order to be entered and served on the parties at the conclusion of the hearing, rather than after the expiration of the exceptions period as was true under the old rule. In addition, the amended subdivision requires that the interim order include language advising the parties of their right to file exceptions within ten days of the date of the order.

   Support payments are due and owing under the interim order which continues in effect until the court enters a final order after considering the parties’ exceptions. Therefore, extension of the deadline for entering the final order by fifteen days does not prejudice the persons dependent upon payment of the support.

Explanatory Comment—2006
   The time for filing exceptions has been expanded from ten to twenty days. The purpose of this amendment is to provide ample opportunity for litigants and counsel to receive notice of the entry of the order, to assure commonwealth-wide consistency in calculation of time for filing and to conform to applicable general civil procedural rules.

Rule 1910.13-1. Failure or Refusal to Appear Pursuant to Order of Court. Bench Warrant.
 (a)  If a party fails to appear at a conference and/or hearing as directed by order of court, the court may issue a bench warrant for the arrest of the party if it finds

   (1)  following a hearing on the record that the party had actual notice that the party was ordered to attend the conference and/or hearing, or

   (2)  upon the affidavit of a hearing officer or conference officer that

     (i)   the order of court scheduling the conference and/or hearing was served by ordinary mail with the return address of the domestic relations section appearing thereon, that the mail was not returned to the domestic relations section within fifteen days after mailing, and that, at a date after the order of court was mailed, the domestic relations section has verified through the U.S. Postal Service or by electronic means that mail for the party was being delivered at the address to which the court order was mailed; or

     (ii)   the party signed a receipt indicating acceptance of a copy of the court order; or

     (iii)   an employee of the court handed a copy of the order to the party; or

     (iv)   a competent adult handed a copy of the court order to the party, and filed an affidavit of service.

   Official Note

   See Rule 76 for the definition of ‘‘competent adult.’’

   The support statute, at 23 Pa.C.S.A. §  4353(a), requires parties to a support proceeding to notify the domestic relations section within seven days of a change of personal address. Pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S.A. §  4353(a.1), the court may deem due process service requirements to have been met upon delivery of written notice to the most recent address the party filed with the domestic relations section.

 (b)  The request for a bench warrant shall be made by the domestic relations office within sixty days following the party’s failure to appear. The request shall be in the form provided by Rule 1910.13-2(b), and shall include the hearing officer or conference officer’s certification that the party has not appeared for any domestic relations matter involving the same parties since the date the party failed to appear.

 (c)  Upon appearance in court by a party on the matter underlying the bench warrant, the bench warrant shall be vacated forthwith and the notice shall be given to all computer networks into which the bench warrant has been entered.

 (d)  When a bench warrant is executed, the case is to proceed in accordance with the following procedures.

   (1)  When an individual is arrested pursuant to a bench warrant, he or she shall be taken without unnecessary delay for a hearing on the bench warrant. The hearing shall be conducted by the judicial officer who issued the bench warrant, or, another judicial officer designated by the president judge or by the president judge’s designee to conduct bench warrant hearings. As used in this rule, ‘‘judicial officer’’ is limited to the common pleas court judge who issued the bench warrant, or common pleas court judge designated by the president judge or by the president judge’s designee to conduct bench warrant hearings.

   (2)  In the discretion of the judicial officer, the bench warrant hearing may be conducted using two-way simultaneous audio-visual communication.

   (3)  When the individual is arrested in the county of issuance, and the bench warrant hearing cannot be conducted promptly after the arrest, the individual shall be lodged in the county jail pending the hearing. The authority in charge of the county jail promptly shall notify the sheriff’s office and the director of the domestic relations section that the individual is being held pursuant to the bench warrant.

   (4)  When the individual is arrested outside the county of issuance, the authority in charge of the county jail in the arresting county promptly shall notify the proper authorities in the county of issuance that the individual is being held pursuant to the bench warrant.

   (5)  The bench warrant hearing shall be conducted without unnecessary delay after the individual is lodged in the jail of the county of issuance of that bench warrant. The individual shall not be detained without a hearing on the bench warrant longer than 72 hours, or the close of the next business day if the 72 hours expires on a non-business day.

   (6)  At the conclusion of the bench warrant hearing following the disposition of the matter, the judicial officer immediately shall vacate the bench warrant.

   (7)  If a bench warrant hearing is not held within the time limits in paragraph (d)(5), the bench warrant shall expire by operation of law.

Explanatory Comment—1994
   In 1988, Section 4342 of the Domestic Relations Code, 23 Pa.C.S. §  4342, was amended to require establishment of procedures for expedited contempt in support. Those procedures are set forth in new Rules 1910.13-1, 1910.13-2, and 1910.21-1 through 1910.21-7.

   Former Rule 1910.13 provided for the issuance of a bench warrant for failure of a person to obey a court order other than an order for support. It is replaced with new Rule 1910.13-1 which sets forth detailed procedures for the issuance of a bench warrant, and new Rule 1910.13-2 which provides the associated forms. The new rules apply only to a party who fails to appear at a support conference or hearing as directed by an order of court.

   An individual arrested pursuant to a bench warrant can be incarcerated for a period not to exceed seventy-two hours prior to hearing as set forth in new Rule 1910.13-1(d). Under the old rules, if the court was unavailable at the time of arrest, the individual could not be held. Therefore, law enforcement officials were unable to execute bench warrants in the evenings or on weekends, when their efforts were most likely to be successful. By limiting the possible period of incarceration to seventy-two hours, new Rule 1910.13-1(d) balances the need to bring parties before the court with the desire to avoid lengthy pre-hearing detention. Bail can be set by the court where appropriate, providing additional protection for the respondent.

Explanatory Comment—1999
   The rules of civil procedure governing service of original process and other legal papers have used the term ‘‘competent adult.’’ In certain circumstances, the term has been used with the restrictive language ‘‘who is not a party to the action.’’

   The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has amended Definition Rule 76 by adding the following definition: ‘‘‘competent adult’ means an individual eighteen years of age or older who is neither a party to the action nor an employee or a relative of a party.’’ In view of this new definition, the rules of civil procedure which used the term ‘‘competent adult who is not a party to the action’’ have been amended by deleting as unnecessary the restrictive language ‘‘who is not a party to the action.’’ These rules using the term ‘‘competent adult’’ will be governed by the new definition. The rules which used the term ‘‘competent adult’’ without the restrictive language have been amended by deleting the word ‘‘competent,’’ thus continuing to permit service by an adult without further restriction.

Explanatory Comment—2006
   Beginning in 2006, bench warrants issued for failure to obey a court order to appear in a support matter will be available through the Judicial Network (‘‘JNET’’) system. JNET expands the capacity of law enforcement officers throughout the commonwealth to be informed of outstanding bench warrants issued by both the criminal and civil courts. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has promulgated new Pa.R.Crim.P. 150, effective August 1, 2006, which sets forth the procedure related to criminal bench warrants. The amendments to Rules 1910.13-1 and 1910.13-2 track the new criminal procedural rule so that bench warrant procedures will be uniform throughout the commonwealth. For additional information see the Criminal Procedural Rules Committee’s Final Report explaining new Pa.R.Crim.P. 150, published with the promulgation order at 36 Pa.B. 184 (January 14, 2006).

Immediately preceding text appears at serial pages (311801) to (311803).

Rule 1910.14. Defendant Leaving Jurisdiction. Security.
 At any stage of the proceeding, upon affidavit that the defendant is about to leave the jurisdiction, the court may issue appropriate process directing that the defendant be brought before the court at such time as the court may direct. At that time the court may direct that the defendant give security, with one or more sureties, to appear when directed by the court or to comply with any order of court.

Rule 1910.15. Paternity.
 (a)  Acknowledgment of Paternity. If the action seeks support for a child born out of wedlock and the alleged father is named as defendant, the defendant may acknowledge paternity in a verified writing. The conference officer shall advise the parties that pursuant to Section 5103(d) of Title 23 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes an acknowledgment constitutes conclusive evidence of defendant’s paternity without further judicial ratification in any action to establish support. Upon defendant’s execution of the written acknowledgment, the action shall proceed as in other actions for support.

 (b) Genetic Testing. If the defendant appears but does not execute an acknowledgment of paternity at the conference:

   (1)  The court shall enter an order directing the parties to appear for genetic testing. The order must advise the defendant that his failure to appear for the testing will result in entry of an order finding that he is the father of the child. The order must also advise the plaintiff that her failure to appear for testing may result in sanctions, including entry of an order dismissing the paternity action without prejudice.

   (2)  The conference officer shall advise and provide written notice to the parties that they may enter into a written stipulation whereby both agree to submit to genetic testing for the purpose of resolving finally the issue of paternity. If the test results indicate a 99% or higher probability of paternity, the defendant shall be stipulated to be the biological father of the child and the case referred for a child support conference. If the test results indicate an exclusion, the action shall be dismissed. The written stipulation constitutes a waiver of the right to a hearing on the genetic testing or trial on the issue of paternity.

   (3)  The conference officer shall advise and provide written notice to the parties that if they do not enter into a written stipulation and the test results do not indicate an exclusion, there will be a hearing regarding genetic testing or trial before a judge without a jury on the issue of paternity in accordance with the procedures set forth in subdivision (d) of this Rule.

 (c)  Estoppel and Presumption of Paternity. If either party or the court raises the issue of estoppel or the issue of whether the presumption of paternity is applicable, the court shall dispose promptly of the issue and may stay the order for genetic testing until the issue is resolved.

 (d)  Post-Testing Procedures.

   (1)  The results of the genetic tests shall be provided in writing to counsel for the parties or, if unrepresented, to the parties themselves.

   (2)  If the results of the genetic tests resolve the issue of paternity pursuant to the stipulation of the parties, a paternity order shall be entered and served on the parties. If the defendant is excluded, the action shall be dismissed. If the defendant is stipulated to be the biological father, the action shall proceed as in other actions for support.

   (3)  If the results of the genetic tests do not resolve the issue of paternity pursuant to the stipulation of the parties, but the test results indicate a 99% or more probability of paternity, the court shall issue a rule against the defendant to show cause why an order should not be entered finding him to be the father. The rule shall advise the defendant that pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S. §  4343 his defense is limited to a showing by clear and convincing evidence that the results of the genetic tests are not reliable. The rule shall direct that an answer be filed within 20 days after service of the rule on the defendant. The answer shall state the material facts which constitute this defense. Any allegation of fact which does not appear of record must be verified.

 If an answer is not timely filed, the court shall enter an order finding paternity and refer the action to conference and hearing as in other actions for support. If an answer is filed raising a disputed issue of material fact relating to the reliability of the genetic testing, the case shall be listed promptly for expedited hearing before a judge. The burden of proof at the hearing is on the defendant and is limited to proof by clear and convincing evidence that the results of the genetic tests are not reliable.

   (4)  If the results of the genetic tests do not resolve the issue of paternity and the test results indicate less than a 99% probability of paternity, the case shall be promptly listed for expedited trial before a judge.

   (5)  If, after a hearing or trial, the decision is for the defendant on the issue of paternity, a final order shall be entered by the court dismissing the action as to the child. If the decision is against the defendant on the issue of paternity, an interlocutory order shall be entered by the court finding paternity. The court may enter an interim order for child support at that time and shall refer the action to conference and hearing as in other actions for support.

 (e)  Failure to Appear. If defendant fails to appear as ordered for a conference, hearing or trial, or for genetic tests, the court shall, upon proof of service on the defendant, enter an order establishing paternity. The court may also enter an interim order for child support at that time and shall refer the action to conference and hearing as in other actions for support.

 (f)  Appeal of Paternity Order. An order establishing paternity is not an appealable order. The issue of paternity may be included in an appeal from the final order of child support.

Immediately preceding text appears at serial pages (394375) to (394376).

Rule 1910.16-1. Support Obligation. Support Guidelines.
 (a)  Applicability of the Support Guidelines.

   (1)  Except as provided in subdivision (a)(3), the support guidelines determine a spouse’s or parent’s support obligation based on the parties’ combined monthly net income, as defined in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-2, and the number of persons being supported.

   (2)  If a person caring for or having custody of a minor child, who does not have a duty of support to the minor child, initiates a child support action as provided in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.3:

     (i)   the complaint shall name the parents as defendants;

     (ii)   in determining the basic child support obligation, the monthly net income for the individual initiating the action shall not be considered in the support calculation by the trier-of-fact;

     (iii)   the parents’ monthly net incomes shall be combined to determine the basic child support obligation, which shall be apportioned based on the parents’ respective monthly net incomes consistent with Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-4. The parents shall pay the obligee their proportionate share of the basic child support obligation as a separate obligor; and

     (iv)   as with other support actions, the trier-of-fact may adjust or deviate the basic child support, spousal support, or alimony pendente lite obligation consistent with the support guidelines based on the evidence presented by the parties.

  Example 1. The parents have one child, who is in the custody of the maternal grandmother. Maternal grandmother initiates a support action against the parents. Mother’s monthly net income is $3,000 and Father’s monthly net income is $2,000 for a combined monthly net income of $5,000. For purposes of the child support calculation, maternal grandmother’s income is irrelevant and not part of the calculation. The basic child support obligation for one child at a combined monthly net income of $5,000 is $993 per month. Mother’s percentage share of the combined monthly net income is 60% ($3,000/$5,000) and Father’s percentage share of the combined monthly net income is 40% ($2,000/$5,000). Mother’s preliminary monthly share of the child support obligation is $596 ($993 x 60%) and Father’s preliminary monthly share of the child support obligation is $397 ($993 x 40%). Maternal grandmother is the obligee with Mother and Father as separate obligors owing $596 and $397, respectively, to the maternal grandmother.

   (3)  In an action in which the plaintiff is a public body or private agency pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.3, the basic child support obligation shall be calculated under the guidelines based upon the parent’s monthly net income with the public or private entity’s monthly net income as zero. In such cases, each parent shall be treated as a separate obligor, and the parent’s obligation will be based upon the parent’s monthly net income without regard to the other parent’s monthly net income.

     (i)   The basic child support obligation owed to a child not in placement shall be deducted from each parent’s monthly net income before calculating support for the child in placement, including the direct support the support guidelines assume the custodial parent will provide.

  

   Example 2. The parents have three children and do not live in the same household. Mother has primary custody of two children and monthly net income of $2,500 per month. Father’s monthly net income is $4,000. The parties’ third child is in foster care placement. Pursuant to the schedule in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3, the basic child support obligation for the two children with Mother is $1,733. As Father’s income is 62% of the parties’ combined monthly net income, Father’s basic child support obligation to Mother is $1,074 per month. The guidelines assume that Mother will provide $659 per month in direct expenditures to the two children. The agency/obligee brings an action against each parent for the support of the child in placement. Father/obligor’s monthly net income will be $2,926 for purposes of this calculation ($4,000 less $1,074 in support for the children with Mother). As the agency/obligee’s income is zero, Father’s support for the child in placement will be 100% of the basic child support obligation for one child at the $2,926 income level, or $674 per month. Mother/obligor’s net income will be $1,841 for purposes of this calculation ($2,500 less $659 in direct support to the children in Mother’s custody). Mother’s support obligation will be 100% of the basic child support obligation for one child at that income level, or $423 per month.

  

   Example 3. The parents have two children in placement. Father owes child support of $500 per month for two children of a former marriage. At the same income levels as in Example 2, Father’s monthly net income for determining his obligation to the children in placement would be $3,500 ($4,000 less $500 support for two children of prior marriage). Father’s obligation to the agency would be $1,205 per month (100% of the basic child support obligation for two children at the $3,500 per month income level). Mother’s monthly net income would not be diminished as she owes no other child support. Mother would owe $877 for the children in placement (100% of the basic child support obligation for two children at the $2,500 income level).

     (ii)   If the parents reside in the same household, each parent’s respective basic child support obligation to a child that remains in the household and is not in placement shall be calculated according to the guidelines, with the parent having the higher income as the obligor, and the calculated basic child support obligation shall be deducted from the parents’ monthly net incomes for purposes of calculating support for a child in placement.

  

   Example 4. The parents have four children, two of whom are in placement. Mother’s monthly net income is $4,000 and Father’s is $3,000. The basic child support obligation for the two children in the home is $1,841, according to the schedule in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3. As Mother’s monthly net income is 57% of the parties’ combined monthly net income, her share would be $1,049, and Father’s 43% share would be $792. Mother’s monthly net income for purposes of calculating support for the two children in placement would be $2,951 ($4,000 less $1,049). She would pay 100% of the basic child support obligation at that income level, or $1,026, for the children in placement. Father’s monthly net income would be $2,208 ($3,000 less $792), and his obligation to the children in placement would be $772.

     (iii)   If the basic child support obligation exceeds the placement’s cost, the trier-of-fact shall:

       (A)   deviate the basic child support obligation downward; and

       (B)   apply the parent’s percentage of the combined monthly net income to the reduced basic child support obligation.

   (4)  The support of a spouse or child is a priority obligation so that a party is expected to meet this obligation by adjusting the party’s other expenditures.

 (b)  Support Obligation. The support obligation (child support, spousal support, or alimony pendente lite) awarded pursuant to the Pa.R.C.P. Nos. 1910.11 and 1910.12 procedures shall be determined in accordance with the support guidelines, which consist of the guidelines expressed as the basic child support schedule in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3, the Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-4 formulas, and the operation of the support guidelines as set forth in these rules.

 (c)  Spousal Support and Alimony Pendente Lite.

   (1)  Spousal support and alimony pendente lite orders shall not be in effect simultaneously.

   (2)  In determining a spousal support or alimony pendente lite obligation’s duration, the trier-of-fact shall consider the marriage’s duration, i.e., the date of marriage to the date of final separation.

 (d)  Rebuttable Presumption. If the trier-of-fact determines that a party has a duty to pay support, there is a rebuttable presumption that the guideline-calculated support obligation is the correct support obligation.

   (1)  The presumption is rebutted if the trier-of-fact concludes in a written finding or states on the record that the guideline support obligation is unjust or inappropriate.

   (2)  The trier-of-fact shall consider the child’s and parties’ special needs and obligations, and apply the Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-5 deviation factors, as appropriate.

 (e) Support Guidelines Review. The support guidelines shall be reviewed at least every four years to ensure that their application determines the appropriate support obligation.

Explanatory Comment—2010
   Introduction. Pennsylvania law requires that child and spousal support be awarded pursuant to a statewide guideline. 23 Pa.C.S. §  4322(a). That statute further provides that the guideline shall be ‘‘established by general rule by the Supreme Court, so that persons similarly situated shall be treated similarly.’’ Id.

   Pursuant to federal law, The Family Support Act of 1988 (P. L. 100-485, 102 Stat. 2343 (1988), all states are required to have statewide child support guidelines. Federal regulations, 45 CFR 302.56, further require that the guidelines be reviewed at least once every four years and that such reviews include an assessment of the most recent economic data on child-rearing costs and a review of data from case files to assure that deviations from the guidelines are limited. The Pennsylvania statute also requires a review of the support guidelines every four years. 23 Pa.C.S.A. §  4322(a).

   The Domestic Relations Procedural Rules Committee of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania began the mandated review process in early 2007. The committee was assisted in its work by Jane Venohr, Ph.D., an economist with the Center for Policy Research, under contract between the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare and Policy Studies, Inc. As a result of the review, the committee recommended to the Supreme Court several amendments to the statewide guidelines.

   A. Income Shares Model. Pennsylvania’s child support guidelines are based upon the Income Shares Model. That model was developed under the Child Support Guidelines Project funded by the U.S. Office of Child Support Enforcement and administered by the National Center for State Courts. The Guidelines Project Advisory Group recommended the Income Shares Model for state guidelines. At present, 37 states use the Income Shares Model as a basis for their child support guidelines.

   The Income Shares Model is based upon the concept that the child of separated, divorced or never-married parents should receive the same proportion of parental income that she or he would have received if the parents lived together. A number of authoritative economic studies provide estimates of the average amount of household expenditures for children in intact households. These studies show that the proportion of household spending devoted to children is directly related to the level of household income and to the number of the children. The basic support amounts reflected in the schedule in Rule 1910.16-3 represent average marginal expenditures on children for food, housing, transportation, clothing and other miscellaneous items that are needed by children and provided by their parents, including the first $250 of unreimbursed medical expenses incurred annually per child.

   1. Economic Measures. The support schedule in Rule 1910.16-3 is based upon child-rearing expenditures measured by David M. Betson, Ph.D., Professor of Economics, University of Notre Dame. Dr. Betson’s measurements were developed for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for the explicit purpose of assisting states with the development and revision of child support guidelines. Dr. Betson’s research also was used in developing the prior schedule, effective in January 2006. Dr. Betson updates his estimates using data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. In the current schedule, those figures were converted to 2008 price levels using the Consumer Price Index.

   2. Source of Data. The estimates used to develop the schedule are based upon national data. The specific sources of the data are the periodic Consumer Expenditure Surveys. Those national surveys are used because they are the most detailed available source of data on household expenditures. The depth and quality of this information is simply not available at the state level and would be prohibitively costly to gather.

   The U. S. Department of Agriculture’s Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion (‘‘CNPP’’) also develops economic estimates for the major categories of child-rearing expenditures. Although the committee reviewed these estimates, it is aware of only one state that relies upon the CNPP estimates as a basis for its child support schedule, and even that state makes certain adjustments.

   B. Statutory Considerations. The Pennsylvania statute, 23 Pa.C.S.A. §  4322(a), provides:

   

  Child and spousal support shall be awarded pursuant to a Statewide guideline as established by general rule by the Supreme Court, so that persons similarly situated shall be treated similarly. The guideline shall be based upon the reasonable needs of the child or spouse seeking support and the ability of the obligor to provide support. In determining the reasonable needs of the child or spouse seeking support and the ability of the obligor to provide support, the guideline shall place primary emphasis on the net incomes and earning capacities of the parties, with allowable deviations for unusual needs, extraordinary expenses and other factors, such as the parties’ assets, as warrant special attention. The guideline so developed shall be reviewed at least once every four years.

   1. Reasonable Needs and Reasonable Ability to Provide Support. The guidelines make financial support of a child a primary obligation and assume that parties with similar net incomes will have similar reasonable and necessary expenses. After the basic needs of the parents have been met, the child’s needs shall receive priority. The guidelines assume that if the obligor’s net income is at the poverty level, he or she is barely able to provide for his or her own basic needs. In those cases, therefore, the entry of a minimal order may be appropriate after considering the party’s living expenses. In some cases, it may not be appropriate to enter a support order at all. In most cases, however, a party’s living expenses are not relevant in determining his or her support obligation. Rather, as the statute requires, the obligation is based upon the reasonable needs of a dependent spouse or child and the reasonable ability of the obligor to pay.

   2. Net Income. The guidelines use the net incomes of the parties. Each parent is required to contribute a share of the child’s reasonable needs in proportion to that parent’s share of the combined net income. The custodial parent makes these contributions through direct expenditures for food, shelter, clothing, transportation and other reasonable needs. The non-custodial parent makes contributions through periodic support payments to the custodial parent. Rule 1910.16-2(d) has been amended to clarify the provisions relating to income and earning capacity.

   3. Allowable Deviations. The guidelines are designed to treat similarly situated parents, spouses and children in the same manner. However, when there are unavoidable differences, deviations must be made from the guidelines. Failure to deviate from these guidelines by considering a party’s actual expenditures where there are special needs and special circumstances constitutes a misapplication of the guidelines.

   C. Child Support Schedule. The child support schedule in Rule 1910.16-3 has been amended to reflect updated economic data, as required by federal and state law, to ensure that children continue to receive adequate levels of support. The support amounts in the schedule have been expanded to apply to a combined net monthly income of $30,000 and remain statistically valid. The economic data support the revised schedule.

   D. Self-Support Reserve (‘‘SSR’’). The amended schedule also incorporates an increase in the ‘‘Self-Support Reserve’’ or ‘‘SSR’’ from $748 per month to $867 per month, the 2008 federal poverty level for one person. Formerly designated as the ‘‘Computed Allowance Minimum’’ or ‘‘CAM,’’ the Self-Support Reserve, as it is termed in most other states’ guidelines, is intended to assure that low-income obligors retain sufficient income to meet their own basic needs, as well as to maintain the incentive to continue employment. The SSR is built into the schedule in Rule 1910.16-3 and adjusts the basic support obligation to prevent the obligor’s net income from falling below $867 per month. Because the schedule in Rule 1910.16-3 applies to child support only, Rule 1910.16-2(e)(1)(B) provides for a similar adjustment in spousal support and alimony pendente lite cases to assure that the obligor retains a minimum of $867 per month.

   E. Shared Custody. In creating the new schedule, the amounts of basic child support were first increased to reflect updated economic data, including 2008 price levels. Next, the amounts of basic child support were adjusted to incorporate into the schedule the assumption that the children spend 30% of the time with the obligor and that the obligor makes direct expenditures on their behalf during that time. That does not mean that the entire schedule was reduced by 30%. Only those variable expenditures, such as food and entertainment, that fluctuate based upon parenting time were adjusted.

   The calculation in Rule 1910.16-4(c) reduces an obligor’s support obligation further if the obligor spends significantly more time with the children. The revised schedule assumes that the obligor has 30% parenting time. The obligor will receive an additional 10% reduction in the amount of support owed at 40% parenting time, increasing incrementally to a 20% reduction at 50% parenting time. This method may still result in a support obligation even if custody of the children is equally shared. In those cases, the rule provides for a maximum obligation which may reduce the obligation so that the obligee does not receive a larger portion of the parties’ combined income than the obligor.

   F. Child Care Expenses. Rule 1910.16-6(a) was amended in 2006 to provide that child care expenses incurred by both parties shall be apportioned between the parties in recognition of the fact that a non-custodial parent also may incur such expenses during his or her custodial periods with the children.

   G. Spousal Support and Alimony Pendente Lite. Subdivision (c) has been amended to require the court to consider the duration of the marriage in determining the duration of a spousal support or alimony pendente lite award. The language was moved from Rule 1910.16-5 which deals with deviation. The primary purpose of this provision is to prevent the unfairness that arises in a short-term marriage when the obligor is required to pay support over a substantially longer period of time than the parties were married and there is little or no opportunity for credit for these payments at the time of equitable distribution.

   H. Other Amendments. All of the examples in the guidelines have been updated to reflect the changes to the basic child support schedule. Prior explanatory comments have been deleted or revised and incorporated into new comments.

Explanatory Comment—2013
   The schedule of basic child support has been updated to reflect newer economic data. The schedule was prepared by Jane Venohr, Ph.D., the economist who assisted in the last guideline review using the same methodology. It includes an increase in the Self-Support Reserve to $931 per month, the 2012 federal poverty level for one person.

Explanatory Comment—2017
   Pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.3(a), a person having custody of a child or caring for a child may initiate a support action against the child’s parent(s). Previously, this rule only addressed when a public body or private agency had custody of a child but was silent with regard to an individual third party, e.g., grandparent, seeking support. The rule has been amended by adding a new subdivision (a)(2) and renumbering the previous (a)(2) to (a)(3). In addition, an example illustrating the new (a)(2) calculation has been included.

   Subdivision (a)(2) excludes the income of the third party/obligee, as that person does not have a duty of support to the child; instead, the rule uses the combined monthly net income of the parents to determine the basic child support amount, which is then apportioned between the parents consistent with their respective percentage of the combined monthly net income in the same manner as a parent vs. parent support action. However, under this rule, each parent would be a separate obligor, would pay the obligee their proportionate share under a separate support order, and would be subject to separate enforcement proceedings. Under (a)(2), the exclusion of the third party’s income is consistent with Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-2(b)(2)(ii) as that rule relates to an action for support by a third party against a surviving parent in which the child receives a Social Security derivative benefit due to the death of the other parent.

   In accordance with Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-6(c), payment of the first $250 of unreimbursed medical expenses per year per child is applicable to third party/obligees in support actions governed by (a)(2). The first $250 of unreimbursed medical expenses is built into the Basic Child Support Schedule.

Rule 1910.16-2. Support Guidelines. Calculation of Monthly Net Income.
 Generally, the basic child support, spousal support, or alimony pendente lite obligation is based on the parties’ monthly net incomes.

 (a)  Monthly Gross Income. Monthly gross income is ordinarily based on at least a six-month average of a party’s income. The support law, 23 Pa.C.S. §  4302, defines the term ‘‘income’’ and includes income from any source. The statute lists many types of income including, but not limited to:

   (1)  wages, salaries, bonuses, fees, and commissions;

   (2)  net income from business or dealings in property;

   (3)  interest, rents, royalties, and dividends;

   (4)  pensions and all forms of retirement;

   (5)  income from an interest in an estate or trust;

   (6)  Social Security disability benefits, Social Security retirement benefits, temporary and permanent disability benefits, workers’ compensation, and unemployment compensation;

   (7)  alimony if, in the trier-of-fact’s discretion, inclusion of part or all of it is appropriate; and

 

   (8)  other entitlements to money or lump sum awards, without regard to source, including:

     (i)   lottery winnings;

     (ii)   income tax refunds;

     (iii)   insurance compensation or settlements;

     (iv)   awards and verdicts; and

     (v)   payments due to and collectible by an individual regardless of source.

 

 (b)  Treatment of Public Assistance, SSI Benefits, Social Security Payments to a Child Due to a Parent’s Death, Disability or Retirement, and Foster Care Payments.

   (1)  Public Assistance and SSI Benefits. Neither public assistance nor Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits shall be included as income for determining support.

   (2)  Child’s Social Security Derivative Benefits.

     (i)   If a child is receiving Social Security derivative benefits due to a parent’s retirement or disability:

       (A)   The trier-of-fact shall determine the basic child support obligation as follows:

         (I)   add the child’s benefit to the monthly net income of the party who receives the child’s benefit;

         (II)   calculate the parties’ combined monthly net income, including the child’s benefit;

         (III)   determine the basic child support obligation set forth in the Pa.R.Civ.P. 1910.16-3 schedule; and

         (IV)   apportion the basic child support obligation between the parties based on the party’s percentage of the combined monthly net income.

       (B)   If the obligee receives the child’s benefit, the trier-of-fact shall deduct the child’s benefit from the basic child support obligation of the party whose retirement or disability created the child’s benefit.

       (C)   If the obligor receives the child’s benefit, the trier-of-fact shall not deduct the child’s benefit from the obligor’s basic child support obligation, even if the obligor’s retirement or disability created the child’s benefit. To illustrate for the parties the impact of the obligor receiving the benefit instead of the obligee, the trier-of-fact shall provide the parties with two calculations theoretically assigning the benefit to each household.

       (D)   The trier-of-fact shall allocate the expenses in Pa.R.Civ.P. 1910.16-6(a)—(e) based on the parties’ monthly net incomes without considering the child’s benefit.

       (E)   In equally shared custody cases, the party with the higher monthly net income, excluding the child’s benefit, is the obligor.

     (ii)   If a child is receiving Social Security derivative benefits due to a parent’s death, the trier-of-fact shall determine the surviving parent’s basic child support obligation as follows:

       (A)   The non-parent obligee’s monthly net income shall include only those funds the obligee is receiving on the child’s behalf, including the Social Security derivative benefit.

       (B)   If the surviving-parent obligor receives the Social Security derivative benefit, the benefit shall be added to the parent’s monthly net income to calculate child support.

   (3)  Foster Care Payments. If a party to a support action is a foster parent or is receiving payments from a public or private agency for the care of a child who is not the party’s biological or adoptive child, the trier-of-fact shall not include those payments in the party’s monthly net income for purposes of calculating child support for the foster parent’s or other caretaker’s biological or adoptive child.

 

 (c)  Monthly Net Income.

   (1)  Unless these rules provide otherwise, the trier-of-fact shall deduct only the following items from monthly gross income to arrive at monthly net income:

     (i)   federal, state, and local income taxes;

     (ii)   unemployment compensation taxes and Local Services Taxes (LST);

     (iii)   F.I.C.A. payments (Social Security, Medicare and Self-Employment taxes) and non-voluntary retirement payments;

     (iv)   mandatory union dues; and

     (v)   alimony paid to the other party.

   (2)  In computing a spousal support or alimony pendente lite obligation, the trier-of-fact shall:

     (i)   deduct from the obligor’s monthly net income child support, spousal support, alimony pendente lite, or alimony amounts paid to children and former spouses, who are not part of this action; and

     (ii)   include in a party’s monthly net income alimony pendente lite or alimony received from a former spouse that was not included in the party’s gross income, as provided in subdivision (a).

 

 (d)  Reduced Income or Fluctuating Earnings.

   (1)  Voluntary Income Reduction—Existing Orders. The trier-of-fact shall not downwardly adjust a party’s net income from an existing order if the trier-of-fact finds that:

     (i)   the party’s income reduction resulted from the party willfully attempting to favorably affect the party’s basic support obligation; or

     (ii)   the party voluntarily assumed a lower paying job, quit a job, left employment, changed occupations, changed employment status to pursue an education, or employment is terminated due to willful misconduct.

   (2)  Involuntary Income Reduction. Incarceration. Earnings Fluctuations—Existing Orders.

     (i)   Involuntary Income Reduction. The trier-of-fact shall adjust a party’s monthly net income from an existing order for substantial continuing involuntary decreases in income due to an employment situation over which the party has no control, including, but not limited to, illness, lay-off, termination, or job elimination.

     (ii)   Incarceration.

       (A)   Except as set forth in subdivision (d)(2)(ii)(B), the trier-of-fact shall:

         (I)   consider an incarcerated party’s income reduction as an involuntary income reduction as set forth in subdivision (d)(2)(i); and

         (II)   adjust the incarcerated party’s monthly net income accordingly.

       (B)   Exception.

         (I)   A party’s incarceration shall not constitute an involuntary income reduction when the incarceration is due to support enforcement purposes or a criminal offense in which the party’s dependent child or the obligee was the victim; and

         (II)   The trier-of-fact makes a written finding that downwardly adjusting the incarcerated party’s monthly net income would be unjust or inappropriate and, in a child support action, takes into consideration the child’s best interest.

     (iii)   Earnings Fluctuations. The trier-of-fact shall not adjust a party’s monthly net income from an existing order due to normal or temporary earnings fluctuations.

   (3)  Seasonal Employees. Generally, the trier-of-fact shall base a seasonal employee’s monthly net income on a yearly average.

   (4)  Earning Capacity—Initial Orders.

     (i)   When calculating an initial order, if a party willfully fails to obtain or maintain appropriate employment, the trier-of-fact may impute to the party an income equal to the party’s earning capacity.

       (A)   Earning Capacity Limitation. The trier-of-fact:

         (I)   shall not impute to the party an earning capacity that exceeds the amount the party could earn from one full-time position; and

         (II)   shall determine a reasonable work regimen based upon the party’s relevant circumstances, including the jobs available within a particular occupation, working hours and conditions, and whether a party has exerted substantial good faith efforts to find employment.

       (B)   The trier-of-fact shall base the party’s earning capacity on the subdivision (d)(4)(ii) factors.

       (C)   After assessing a party’s earning capacity, the trier-of-fact shall state the reasons for the assessment in writing or on the record.

       (D)   When the trier-of-fact imputes an earning capacity to a party who would incur childcare expenses if the party were employed, the trierof-fact shall consider reasonable childcare responsibilities and expenses for the purpose of discretionary allocation pursuant to Pa.R.Civ.P. 1910.16-6(a)(1)(ii).

     (ii)   Factors. In determining a party’s earning capacity, the trier-of-fact shall consider the party’s:

       (A)   child care responsibilities and expenses;

       (B)   assets;

       (C)   residence;

       (D)   employment and earnings history;

       (E)   job skills;

       (F)   educational attainment;

       (G)   literacy;

       (H)   age;

       (I)   health;

       (J)   criminal record and other employment barriers;

       (K)   record of seeking work;

       (L)   local job market, including the availability of employers who are willing to hire the party;

       (M)   local community prevailing earnings level; and

       (N)   other relevant factors.

 

 (e)  Net Income Affecting Application of the Support Guidelines.

   (1)  Low-Income Cases.

     (i)   Self-Support Reserve (SSR).

       (A)   The SSR is the minimum monthly net income reserved to the obligor to meet the obligor’s basic needs.

       (B)   The SSR amount is $1,063 per month.

     (ii)   Action for Child Support Only. When the obligor’s monthly net income and the number of children in the action intersect in the Basic Child Support Schedule’s shaded area as set forth in Pa.R.Civ.P. 1910.16-3, the trier-of-fact shall determine the obligor’s basic child support obligation utilizing the lesser of the two calculated amounts from the following methodologies.

       (A)   The initial calculation is determined by using the obligor’s monthly net income only, the schedule set forth in Pa.R.Civ.P. 1910.16-3, and the number of children.

       (B)   The second calculation is determined by using the parties’ combined monthly net income and the basic child support formula in Pa.R.Civ.P. 1910.16-4(a).

       (C)   If the obligor’s monthly net income is at or below the SSR, the trier-of-fact may award support only after consideration of the parties’ actual financial resources and living expenses.

 

     (iii)   Action for Spousal Support/Alimony Pendente Lite Only.

       (A)   After calculating the spousal support or alimony pendente lite obligation as provided in Pa.R.Civ.P. 1910.16-4, the spousal support obligation shall not reduce the obligor’s monthly net income below the SSR.

       (B)   If the obligor’s monthly net income after subtracting the spousal support or alimony pendente lite obligation is less than the SSR, the trier-of-fact shall adjust the spousal support or alimony pendente lite obligation downward by an amount sufficient for the obligor to retain the SSR amount.

 

     (iv)   Action with Child Support and Spousal Support or Alimony Pendente Lite.

       (A)   The trier-of-fact shall calculate the spousal support or alimony pendente lite obligation as provided in Pa.R.Civ.P. 1910.16-4.

       (B)   The trier-of-fact shall subtract the calculated spousal support or alimony pendente lite obligation from the obligor’s monthly net income to determine the obligor’s adjusted monthly net income.

       (C)   When the obligor’s adjusted monthly net income and the number of children in the action intersect in the Basic Child Support Schedule’s shaded area as set forth in Pa.R.Civ.P. 1910.16-3, the trier-of-fact:

         (I)   shall not award spousal support or alimony pendente lite; and

         (II)   shall calculate child support as provided in subdivision (e)(1)(ii).

 

       (D)   When the obligor’s monthly net income and the number of children in the action do not intersect in the Basic Child Support Schedule’s shaded area as set forth in Pa.R.Civ.P. 1910.16-3, the trier-of-fact shall calculate child support consistent with Pa.R.Civ.P. 1910.16-4.

         (I)   The combined spousal support or alimony pendente lite and basic child support obligations shall not reduce the obligor’s remaining monthly net income below the SSR.

         (II)   If the obligor’s monthly net income after subtracting the spousal support or alimony pendente lite and basic child support obligations is less than the SSR, the trier-of-fact shall adjust the support obligation downward by an amount sufficient for the obligor to retain the SSR amount.

   (2)  High-Income Cases. If the parties’ combined monthly net income exceeds $30,000, the trier-of-fact shall calculate child support, spousal support, or alimony pendente lite pursuant to Pa.R.Civ.P. 1910.16-3.1.

 

 (f)  Child Tax Credit. In order to maximize the total income available to the parties and children, the trier-of-fact may award, as appropriate, the federal child tax credit to the non-custodial parent, or to either parent in cases of equally shared custody, and require the other party to execute the waiver required by the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. §  152(e). The trier-of-fact shall consider the tax consequences associated with the federal child tax credit in calculating the party’s monthly net income available for support.

Comment:
   Concerning subdivision (a)(7), in determining the appropriateness of including alimony in gross income, the trier-of-fact shall consider whether the party receiving the alimony must include the amount received as gross income when filing federal income taxes. If the alimony is not includable in the party’s gross income for federal income tax purposes, the trier-of-fact may include in the party’s monthly net income the alimony received, as appropriate. See Pa.R.Civ.P. 1910.16-2(c)(2)(ii).

   Since the reasons for ordering payment of alimony vary, the appropriateness of including it in the recipient’s gross income must also vary. For example, if the obligor is paying $1,000 per month in alimony for the express purpose of financing the obligee’s college education, it would be inappropriate to consider that alimony as income from which the obligee could provide child support. However, if alimony is intended to finance the obligee’s general living expenses, inclusion of the alimony as income is appropriate.

   Concerning subdivision (a)(8), the trier-of-fact determines the most appropriate method for imputing lump-sum awards as income for purposes of establishing or modifying the party’s support obligation. These awards may be annualized or averaged over a shorter or longer period depending on the case’s circumstances. The trier-of-fact may require all or part of the lump sum award escrowed to secure the support obligation during that period.

   The trier-of-fact shall not include income tax refunds in a party’s income, if the trier-of-fact factored in the tax refund when calculating the party’s actual tax obligation and monthly net income.

   Concerning subdivision (b), care must be taken to distinguish Social Security from Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits. Social Security benefits are income pursuant to subdivision (a).

   Subdivision (b) Example 1. The obligor has monthly net income of $2,000. The obligee’s monthly net income is $1,500 and the obligee, as primary custodial parent of the parties’ two children, receives $700 per month in Social Security derivative benefits on behalf of the children as a result of the obligor’s disability. Add the children’s benefit to the obligee’s income, which now is $2,200 per month. At the parties’ combined monthly net income of $4,200, the basic child support obligation for two children is $1,372. As the obligor’s income is 48% of the parties’ combined monthly net income, the obligor’s preliminary share of the basic child support obligation is $659. However, because the obligor’s disability created the children’s Social Security derivative benefits that the obligee is receiving, the obligor’s obligation is reduced by the amount of the benefit, $700. As the support obligation cannot be less than zero, the obligor’s basic child support obligation is $0 per month. If it were the obligee’s disability that created the benefit, the obligor’s basic child support obligation would remain $659. If the obligor were receiving the children’s benefit as a result of the obligor’s retirement or disability, the obligor’s monthly net income would include the amount of the benefit and total $2,700, or 64% of the parties’ combined monthly net income. The obligor’s share of the basic child support obligation would then be $878 and would not be reduced by the amount of the children’s benefit because the obligor, not the obligee, is receiving the benefit. Therefore, the obligor’s basic child support obligation is less if the obligee is receiving the benefit created by the obligor.

   Subdivision (b) Example 2. Two children live with Grandmother who receives $800 per month in Social Security death benefits for the children as a result of Father’s death. Grandmother also receives $500 per month from a trust established by Father for the benefit of the children. Grandmother is employed and earns $2,000 net per month. Grandmother seeks support from the children’s mother, who earns $2,000 net per month. For purposes of calculating Mother’s basic child support obligation, Grandmother’s income will be $1,300, the amount she receives on the children’s behalf in Social Security derivative benefits and the trust income. (If Mother were receiving the benefit on the children’s behalf, the benefit would be added to Mother’s monthly net income and would be $2,800. Grandmother’s monthly net income would be $500.) Therefore, Mother’s and Grandmother’s combined monthly net income totals $3,300. The basic child support obligation at the $3,300 monthly net income level for two children is $1,137. As Mother’s monthly net income of $2,000 is 61% of the parties’ combined monthly net income of $3,300, Mother’s basic child support obligation is $694. Since Mother’s retirement or disability did not generate the child’s derivative benefit, the benefit amount is not subtracted from Mother’s basic child support obligation, and Mother owes Grandmother $694. If Grandmother was not receiving the children’s derivative benefits or trust income, Grandmother’s monthly net income for purposes of calculating Mother’s basic child support obligation would be zero, and Mother would pay 100% of the basic child support obligation because Grandmother has no duty to support the children.

   Concerning subdivision (c)(1)(v), because the reasons for ordering payment of alimony vary, the appropriateness of including it in the recipient’s monthly net income must also vary. For example, if the obligor is paying $1,000 per month in alimony for the express purpose of financing the obligee’s college education, it would be inappropriate to consider that alimony as income from which the obligee could provide child support. However, if alimony is intended to finance the obligee’s general living expenses, inclusion of the alimony as income is appropriate.

   The consideration of child care expenses if the party were employed in subdivision (d)(4)(i)(D) is not for purposes of reducing imputed income when calculating the party’s basic child support obligation. The child care expenses that would be payable if a party were employed are subject to discretionary allocation pursuant to Pa.R.Civ.P. 1910.16-6(a)(1)(ii).

   Concerning subdivision (d)(4)(ii), see 45 C.F.R. §  302.56(c)(1)(iii) regarding earning capacity factors.

   Subdivision (e)(1)(ii) Example: The parties have two children. The obligee has monthly net income of $2,500. The obligor has monthly net income of $1,500, which falls into the shaded area of the schedule for two children. The initial calculation is made using only the obligor’s monthly net income. The basic child support obligation for two children would be $397. The second calculation uses the parties’ combined monthly net income. The parties’ combined monthly net income is $4,000. The basic child support obligation for two children is $1,340. The obligor’s proportionate share of the parties’ combined monthly net income is 38% with a basic child support obligation of $509. The obligor’s basic child support obligation using only the obligor’s monthly net income is less than the calculated amount using the parties’ combined monthly net income. As a result, the trier-of-fact should award the lesser amount, and the obligor’s basic child support obligation is $397.

   Subdivision (e)(1)(iii) Example: The obligor has $1,200 monthly net income, and the obligee has $300 monthly net income. The formula in Pa.R.Civ.P. 1910.16-4(a)(1)(Part B) would result in a monthly spousal support obligation of $276 (($1,200 x 33% = $396) minus ($300 x 40% = $120) for a total of $276)). Since this amount leaves the obligor with only $924 per month, the trier-of-fact should adjust the support obligation so the obligor retains at least $1,063 per month. Therefore, the spousal support obligation is $137 per month ($1,200 - $1,063).

   Subdivision (e)(1)(iv) Example: Obligor and obligee have monthly net incomes of $2,000 and $165, respectively, and have two children. Calculating spousal support under subdivision (e)(1)(iv)(A) results in a spousal support obligation of $450 ($2,000 x 25% minus $165 x 30%). Obligor’s adjusted monthly net income ($2,000 minus $450) is $1,550. Obligor’s adjusted monthly net income of $1,550 with two children is in the shaded area of the Basic Child Support Schedule, and as a result, the trier-of-fact shall not award spousal support. Instead, the trier-of-fact should award child support only as provided in subdivision (e)(1)(ii).

   Concerning subdivision (e)(2), see Hanrahan v. Bakker, 186 A.3d 958 (Pa. 2018).

Historical Commentary
   The following commentary is historical in nature and represents statements of the Committee at the time of rulemaking:

Explanatory Comment—2010
   Subdivision (a) addresses gross income for purposes of calculating the support obligation by reference to the statutory definition at 23 Pa.C.S. §  4322. Subdivision (b) provides for the treatment of public assistance, SSI benefits, Social Security derivative benefits, and foster care payments.

   Subdivision (c) sets forth the exclusive list of the deductions that may be taken from gross income in arriving at a party’s net income. When the cost of health insurance premiums is treated as an additional expense subject to allocation between the parties under Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-6, it is not deductible from gross income. However, part or all of the cost of health insurance premiums may be deducted from the obligor’s gross income pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-6(b) in cases in which the obligor is paying the premiums and the obligee has no income or minimal income. Subdivision (c) relates to spousal support or alimony pendente lite awards when there are multiple families. In these cases, a party’s monthly net income must be reduced to account for his or her child support obligations, as well as any pre-existing spousal support, alimony pendente lite or alimony obligations being paid to former spouses who are not the subject of the support action.

   Subdivision (d) has been amended to clarify the distinction between voluntary and involuntary changes in income and the imputing of earning capacity. Statutory provisions at 23 Pa.C.S. §  4322, as well as case law, are clear that a support obligation is based upon the ability of a party to pay, and that the concept of an earning capacity is intended to reflect a realistic, rather than a theoretical, ability to pay support. Amendments to subdivision (d) are intended to clarify when imposition of an earning capacity is appropriate.

   Subdivision (e) has been amended to reflect the updated schedule in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3 and the increase in the Self-Support Reserve (‘‘SSR’’). The schedule now applies to all cases in which the parties’ combined monthly net income is $30,000 or less. The upper income limit of the prior schedule was only $20,000. The support amount at each income level of the schedule also has changed, so the examples in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-2 were revised to be consistent with the new support amounts.

   The SSR is intended to assure that obligors with low incomes retain sufficient income to meet their basic needs and to maintain the incentive to continue employment. When the obligor’s monthly net income or earning capacity falls into the shaded area of the schedule, the basic child support obligation can be derived directly from the schedule in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3. There is no need to use the formula in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-4 to calculate the obligor’s support obligation because the SSR keeps the amount of the obligation the same regardless of the obligee’s income. The obligee’s income may be a relevant factor, however, in determining whether to deviate from the basic guideline obligation pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-5 and in considering whether to require the obligor to contribute to any additional expenses under Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-6.

   Since the schedule in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3 sets forth basic child support only, subdivision (e)(1)(ii) is necessary to reflect the operation of the SSR in spousal support and alimony pendente lite cases. It adjusts the basic guideline obligation, which would otherwise be calculated under the formula in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-4, so that the obligor’s income does not fall below the SSR amount in these cases.

   Previously, the SSR required that the obligor retain at least $748 per month. The SSR now requires that the obligor retain income of at least $867 per month, an amount equal to the 2008 federal poverty level for one person. When the obligor’s monthly net income is less than $867, subdivision (e)(1)(iii) provides that the trier-of-fact must consider the parties’ actual living expenses before awarding support. The guidelines assume that at this income level the obligor is barely able to meet basic personal needs. In these cases, therefore, entry of a minimal order may be appropriate. In some cases, it may not be appropriate to order support at all.

   The schedule at Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3 sets forth the presumptive amount of basic child support to be awarded. If the circumstances warrant, the trier-of-fact may deviate from that amount under Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-5 and may also consider a party’s contribution to additional expenses, which are typically added to the basic amount of support under Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-6. If, for example, the obligor earns only $900 per month but is living with his or her parents, or has remarried and is living with a fully-employed spouse, the trier-of-fact may consider an upward deviation under Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-5(b)(3) or may order the party to contribute to the additional expenses under Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-6. Consistent with the goals of the SSR, however, the trier-of-fact should ensure that the overall support obligation leaves the obligor with sufficient income to meet basic personal needs and to maintain the incentive to continue working so that support can be paid.

   Subdivision (e) also has been amended to eliminate the application of Melzer v. Witsberger, 480 A.2d 991 (Pa. 1984), in high-income child support cases. In cases in which the parties’ combined net monthly income exceeds $30,000, child support will be calculated in accordance with the three-step process in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3.1(a).

Explanatory Comment—2013
   The SSR has been increased to $931, the 2012 federal poverty level for one person. Subdivision (e) has been amended to require that when the obligor’s income falls into the shaded area of the basic child support schedule in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3, two calculations must be performed. One calculation uses only the obligor’s income and the other is a regular calculation using both parties’ incomes, awarding the lower amount to the obligee. The two-step process is intended to address those cases in which the obligor has minimal income and the obligee’s income is substantially greater.

Explanatory Comment—2015
   The rule has been amended to provide that a party’s support obligation will be reduced by the child’s Social Security derivative benefit amount if that party’s retirement or disability created the benefit and the benefit is being paid to the household in which the child primarily resides or the obligee in cases of equally shared custody. In most cases, payment of the benefit to the obligee’s household will increase the resources available to the child and the parties. The rule is intended to encourage parties to direct that the child’s benefits be paid to the obligee.

Explanatory Comment—2021
   The Self-Support Reserve is determined by the Federal Poverty Guideline for one person converted to a monthly amount—currently $1,063—for the year the Basic Child Support Schedule was derived.

   Subdivision (e)(1) addresses low-income cases and has been completely rewritten and identifies the current monthly Self-Support Reserve (SSR) amount as $1,063. The SSR is the amount of the obligor’s monthly net income that is reserved to meet the obligor’s basic needs. Subdivisions (e)(1)(ii)—(iv) adjust the methodology for calculating support when the obligor’s monthly net income is at or near the SSR amount.

Rule 1910.16-3. Support Guidelines. Basic Child Support Schedule.
 The following schedule represents the amounts spent on children of intact families by combined monthly net income and number of children. Combined monthly net income is on the schedule’s vertical axis, and the number of children is on the schedule’s horizontal axis. This schedule determines the basic child support obligation. Unless these rules provide otherwise, the obligor’s basic child support obligation shall be computed using either the formula set forth in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-4(a)(1)(Part C) or (a)(2)(Part I).

Explanatory Comment—2010
   The basic child support schedule has been amended to reflect updated economic data. The schedule has been expanded to include all cases in which the parties’ combined net monthly income is $30,000 or less. It also reflects an increase in the Self-Support Reserve to $867, the 2008 poverty level for one person. The schedule was further adjusted to incorporate an assumption that the children spend 30% of the time with the obligor.

Explanatory Comment—2013
   The basic child support schedule has been amended to reflect updated economic data. It also reflects an increase in the Self-Support Reserve to $931, the 2012 poverty level for one person, which has been incorporated into the schedule.

Explanatory Comment—2021
   Previously, the Basic Child Support Schedule incorporated a 30% child custody presumption, which created approximately a 5% decrease in the basic child support obligation across all combined monthly net incomes regardless of the actual custody schedule. The new Basic Child Support Schedule reflects the actual expenses of an intact family living in a single household at the various combined monthly net incomes and the number of children with no shared custody adjustment.

   To the extent the parties share physical custody with the obligor having 40% or more of the annual overnights as set forth in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-4(c), the formula in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-4(a)(1)(Part D) or (a)(2)(Part II) should be used to calculate the appropriate shared custody adjustment.

Rule 1910.16-3.1. Support Guidelines. High-Income Cases.
 (a)  Child Support.

   (1)  Presumptive Minimum Basic Child Support Obligation.

     (i)   The presumptive minimum basic child support obligation is the support obligation that the trier-of-fact would have awarded if the parties’ combined monthly net income was $30,000.

     (ii)   When the parties’ combined monthly net income exceeds $30,000, the calculated support obligation shall not be less than the presumptive minimum basic child support obligation.

   (2)  High-Income Child Support Calculation. With the following three-step process, the trier-of-fact shall calculate the total child support obligation.

     (i)   Preliminary Analysis. Using the following formula, the trier-of-fact shall:

       (A)   calculate the basic child support obligation based on the parties’ combined monthly net income; and

       (B)   apportion the basic child support obligation based on the parties’ respective monthly net incomes.


One child:	$3,608 + 4.0% of combined monthly net income above $30,000.
Two children:	$4,250 + 4.0% of combined monthly net income above $30,000.
Three children:	$4,951 + 4.7% of combined monthly net income above $30,000.
Four children:	$5,530 + 5.3% of combined monthly net income above $30,000.
Five children:	$6,083 + 5.8% of combined monthly net income above $30,000.
Six children:	$6,613 + 6.3% of combined monthly net income above $30,000.
     (ii)   Substantial or Equally Shared Custody Adjustment. The trier-of-fact shall adjust the basic child support obligation calculated in subdivision (a)(2)(i) for substantial or equally shared custody as set forth in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-4(c).

     (iii)   Final Analysis—Reasonable Needs.

       (A)   In determining the total child support obligation, the trier-of-fact shall consider the child’s reasonable needs based on:

         (I)   the deviation factors in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-5;

         (II)   the additional expenses set forth in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-6; and

         (III)   the parties’ expense statements required by Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.11(c)(2) and Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.27(c)(2)(B).

       (B)   Subject to the presumptive minimum basic child support obligation, the trier-of-fact may upwardly or downwardly adjust the support obligation calculated in subdivisions (a)(2)(i) and (ii) based on the child’s reasonable needs.

   (3)  Final Order. As part of the final order, the trier-of-fact shall state on the record or in writing:

     (i)   findings of fact; and

     (ii)   the reasons for awarding the total child support obligation, including:

       (A)   a discussion of the child’s reasonable needs; and

       (B)   the adjustments or deviations made to the basic child support obligation.

 (b)  Spousal Support or Alimony Pendente Lite.

   (1)  Preliminary Analysis. When the parties’ combined monthly net income exceeds $30,000, the trier-of-fact shall apply the formula in either Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-4(a)(1)(Part B) or (a)(2)(Part IV) in calculating spousal support or alimony pendente lite.

   (2)  Final Analysis. In determining the total spousal support or alimony pendente lite obligation, the trier-of-fact shall consider:

     (i)   the deviation factors in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-5;

     (ii)   the additional expenses set forth in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-6; and

     (iii)   the parties’ expense statements required by Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.11(c)(2) and Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.27(c)(2)(B).

   (3)  Final Order. As part of the final order, the trier-of-fact shall state on the record or in writing:

     (i)   findings of fact; and

     (ii)   the reasons for awarding the final spousal support or alimony pendente lite obligation, including the adjustments or deviations made to the basic spousal support or alimony pendente lite obligation.

Explanatory Comment—2010
   Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3.1 is intended to bring all child support cases under the guidelines and treat similarly situated parties similarly. Thus, high-income child support cases no longer will be decided pursuant to Melzer v. Witsberger, 480 A.2d 991 (Pa. 1984). Economic data support the basic child support schedule up to combined net incomes of $30,000 per month. Above that amount, economic data are not readily available. Thus, for cases in which the parties’ combined monthly net income is above $30,000, the formula first applies a fixed percentage to calculate the support amount. The formula is an extrapolation of the available economic data to high-income cases. Spousal support and alimony pendente lite awards in high-income cases are preliminarily calculated pursuant to the formulas in either Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-4(a)(1)(Part B) or (2)(Part IV). However, in both high-income child support and spousal support and high-income child support and alimony pendente lite cases, the trier-of-fact is required to consider the factors in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-5 before entering a final order and to make findings of fact on the record or in writing. Pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.11(c)(2), in all high-income cases, the parties must submit an Income Statement and the Expense Statement at Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.27(c)(2)(B) to enable the trier-of-fact to consider the factors in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-5.

Explanatory Comment—2011
   The rule has been amended to clarify that the provisions of Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-4(c), regarding support adjustments if the obligor has substantial or shared custody, apply in high-income cases. Previously, when high-income cases were decided pursuant to Melzer v. Witsberger, 480 A.2d 991 (Pa. 1984), case law held that because the time and resources each parent provided to a child were factored into the Melzer formula, the substantial or shared parenting time reductions did not apply to cases decided pursuant to Melzer. See, e.g., Sirio v. Sirio, 951 A.2d 1188 (Pa. Super. 2008); Bulgarelli v. Bulgarelli, 934 A.2d 107 (Pa. Super. 2007). As Melzer no longer applies to calculate support in high-income cases, the prohibition against substantial or shared parenting time reductions in such cases is no longer applicable.

Rule 1910.16-4. Support Guidelines. Calculation of Support Obligation, Formula.
 (a)  The trier-of-fact shall use either the subdivision (1) or subdivision (2) formula to calculate the obligor’s share of basic child support, either from the schedule in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3 or the formula in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3.1(a), as well as spousal support and alimony pendente lite obligations. In high-income cases, the trier-of-fact shall use either the subdivision (1)(Part B) or subdivision (2)(Part IV) formula, as appropriate, as a preliminary analysis in the calculation of spousal support or alimony pendente lite obligations.

   (1)  The formula in Parts A through E is for an order entered on or after January 1, 2019, or for a modification of an order entered before January 1, 2019 that includes spousal support or alimony pendente lite in which the amendments to the Internal Revenue Code made by Section 11051 of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Pub.L. No. 115-97) expressly apply.

   Official Note

   Section 11051 of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Pub.L. No. 115-97) amended the Internal Revenue Code by repealing the alimony deduction—the amount of spousal support, alimony pendente lite, and alimony paid or received—from the payor’s gross income and the alimony inclusion into the payee’s gross income.

   See subdivision (2) for a modification of an order entered before January 1, 2019 that includes spousal support or alimony pendente lite in which the amendments to the Internal Revenue Code made by Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Pub.L. No. 115-97) do not apply to the modification.

 (b)  Order For More Than Six Children. When there are more than six children who are the subject of a single support order, the trier-of-fact shall:

   (1)  calculate the basic child support obligations for six children and five children;

   (2)  subtract the basic child support obligation for five children from the basic child support obligation for six children;

   (3)  multiply the difference from subdivision (b)(2) by the number of children in excess of six; and

   (4)  add the amount from subdivision (b)(3) to the basic child support obligation for six children as determined in subdivision (b)(1).

 (c)  Substantial or Equally Shared Physical Custody.

   (1)  Substantial Physical Custody. When a child spends 40% or more of the annual overnights with the obligor, a rebuttable presumption arises that the obligor is entitled to a reduction in the basic child support obligation to reflect the obligor’s increased direct spending on the child during the obligor’s custodial time.

     (i)   This rebuttable presumption also applies in high income cases decided pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3.1.

     (ii)   Except as provided in subdivision (c)(2), the trier-of-fact shall calculate the adjustment pursuant to the formula set forth in subdivision (a)(1)(Part D) or (a)(2)(Part II).

   (2)  Equally Shared Physical Custody. Without regard to which party initiated the support action, when a child spends an equal number of annual overnights with the parties:

     (i)   The formula in subdivision (a)(1)(Part D) or (a)(2)(Part II) cannot be applied unless the obligor is the party with the higher monthly net income.

     (ii)   The trier-of-fact shall not require the party with the lower monthly net income to pay basic child support to the party with the higher monthly net income. However, this subdivision shall not preclude the entry of an order requiring the party with less monthly net income to contribute to additional expenses pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-6.

     (iii)   Based upon the evidence presented, the trier-of-fact may enter a support order against either party.

     (iv)   If the support calculation results in the obligee receiving a larger share of the parties’ combined monthly net income, the trier-of-fact:

       (A)   shall adjust the obligor’s basic child support obligation so that the combined monthly net income is allocated equally between the two parties; and

       (B)   shall not award spousal support or alimony pendente lite.

  

   Example 1. If the obligor and the obligee have monthly net incomes of $5,000 and $2,300, respectively, the basic child support obligation is $1,901 for two children. Using the income shares formula in Part I, the obligor’s basic child support obligation is 68%, or $1,293. If the children spend 40% of the annual overnights with the obligor, the formula in Part D or Part II applies to reduce the obligor’s basic child support obligation to 58%, or $1,103. If the children spend 45% of the annual overnights with the obligor, the obligor’s basic child support obligation is reduced to 53%, or $1,008. If the children spend an equal number of the annual overnights with the obligor and obligee, the obligor’s basic child support obligation is reduced to 48%, or $912.

  Example 2. Mother and Father have monthly net incomes of $3,000 and $2,700, respectively. Mother has filed for support for the parties’ two children with whom the parties share time equally. As the parties have equal custody and Mother has the higher monthly net income, Mother cannot be the obligee. Although Mother initiated the support action, she would be the obligor. Pursuant to the Basic Child Support Schedule in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3, the basic child support obligation for two children at the parties’ combined monthly net income is $1,585 per month. Mother’s share is 53%, or $840. Application of the Part II or Part D formula results in a 20% reduction in support when the obligor has 50% custody of the children. Mother’s adjusted percentage share of the basic support obligation is 33% (53% - 20% = 33%) and the preliminary adjusted basic child support obligation is $523 (33% of $1,585). However, as this amount would result in Father having a greater share of the parties’ combined monthly net income ($3,223 vs. $2,477), Mother’s basic child support obligation would be adjusted to $150 per month to allocate the parties’ combined monthly net income equally between the two parties and would be the presumptive basic child support obligation payable to Father under these circumstances.

  

   Example 3. If the obligor and the obligee have monthly net incomes of $3,000 and $2,500, respectively, the basic child support obligation for two children is $1,567. The obligor’s share is 55%, or $862 ($1,567 x 55%). If the children spend equal time with the parties, the formula in Part II or Part D results in a basic child support obligation of $548 ($1,567 x 35%) payable to the obligee. Since this amount results in the obligee having monthly net income of $3,048 and the obligor having monthly net income of $2,452, the obligor’s basic child support obligation would be adjusted to $250 to equalize the combined monthly net income between the parties and would be the presumptive basic child support obligation payable to the obligee under these circumstances.

 (d)  Divided or Split Physical Custody. When Each Party Owes Child Support to the Other Party. Varied Partial or Shared Custodial Schedules.

   (1)  Divided or Split Physical Custody. When Each Party Owes Child Support to the Other Party. When calculating a basic child support obligation and each party owes child support to the other party as a result of the custodial arrangement, the trier-of-fact shall offset the parties’ respective basic child support obligations and award the net difference to the obligee as child support.

  

   Example 1. If the parties have three children, one child resides with Mother and two children reside with Father, and the parties’ monthly net incomes are $4,000 and $2,000 respectively, Mother’s basic child support obligation is calculated using the schedule in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3 for two children at the parties’ combined monthly net income of $6,000. The basic child support obligation is $1,628. As Mother’s income is 67% of the parties’ combined monthly net income, Mother’s basic child support obligation for the two children living with Father is $1,091. Father’s basic child support obligation is calculated using the schedule in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3 for one child at the parties’ combined monthly net income of $6,000. The basic child support obligation is $1,097. Father’s basic child support obligation for the child living with Mother is $362. Subtracting $362 from $1,091 produces a basic child support obligation of $729 payable to Father as child support.

  

   Example 2. If the parties have two children, one child resides with Mother and the parties equally share custody (50% - 50%) of the other child, and the parties’ monthly net incomes are as set forth in Example 1. The basic child support obligation is calculated using the schedule in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3 for the one child primarily residing with Mother at the parties’ combined monthly net income of $6,000, the basic child support obligation is $1,097. Father’s income is 33% of the parties’ combined monthly net income, and the basic child support obligation for the child living with Mother is $362. For Mother’s obligation for the child with the equally shared custody arrangement, using the schedule in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3 for one child at the parties’ combined monthly net income of $6,000, the basic child support obligation is $1,097. Mother’s proportionate share of the combined monthly net incomes is 67%, but it is reduced to 47% after applying the shared parenting time adjustment for 50% custody under subdivision (c). Mother’s basic child support obligation for the shared custody child is $516 ($1,097 x 47%). As Mother’s obligation is greater than Father’s obligation, Father is the obligee and receives the net of the two obligations by subtracting $362 from $516, or $154.

   (2)  Varied Partial or Shared Physical Custodial Schedule.

     (i)   The trier-of-fact may reduce a party’s basic child support obligation when the parties have more than one child and each child spends either different amounts of:

       (A)   partial or equally shared custodial time with the higher monthly net income party; or

       (B)   partial custodial time with the lower monthly net income party.

     (ii)   In determining whether a party is entitled to a reduction as provided in subdivision (d)(2)(i):

       (A)   the trier-of-fact shall:

         (I)   add the percentage of annual overnights each child spends with that party; and

         (II)   divide by the number of children to determine the party’s average percentage of custodial time.

       (B)   If the average percentage of custodial time is 40% or more:

         (I)   subdivision (c) applies; and

         (II)   the trier-of-fact shall reduce the party’s basic child support obligation accordingly.

  Example 1. The parties have two children and one child spends 50% of the annual overnights with Mother, who has the higher monthly net income, and the other child spends 20% of the annual overnights with Mother. Add those percentages together and divide by the number of children (50% plus 20% = 70% divided by 2 children = 35% average time with Mother). Pursuant to subdivision (d)(2)(ii)(B), Mother is not entitled to a reduction in the support order for substantial parenting time.

  Example 2. The parties have three children. Two children spend 50% of the annual overnights with Mother, who has the higher monthly net income, and the third child spends 30% of the annual overnights with Mother. Add the percentages of custodial time for all three children together and divide by the number of children (50% plus 50% plus 30% = 130% divided by three children = 43.33% average percentage of time with Mother). Pursuant to subdivision (d)(2)(ii)(B), Mother is entitled to a reduction in the support order for substantial parenting time.

  Example 3. The parties have three children, Mother has primary custody (60% - 40%) of one child, Father has primary custody (60% - 40%) of one child, and the parties share custody (50% - 50%) of the third child. The parties’ monthly net incomes are $2,500 (Mother) and $2,000 (Father). As a result of the custodial arrangement, Father owes support for the child in the primary custody of Mother and Mother owes support for the child in the primary custody of Father and for the child shared equally between the parties. Father’s basic child support obligation is calculated using the schedule in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3 for one child at the parties’ combined monthly net income of $4,500. The basic child support obligation is $941. Father’s proportionate share of the combined monthly net incomes is 44%, but is reduced to 34% after applying the shared parenting time adjustment for 40% custody under subdivision (c). Father’s basic child support obligation for this child is $320 ($941 x 34%). Mother’s basic child support obligation is calculated using the schedule in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3 for two children at the parties’ combined monthly net income of $4,500. The basic child support obligation is $1,414. Mother has varying partial or shared custody of the two children (40% and 50%). Under subdivision (d)(2), the custodial time is averaged or in this case 45%. Mother’s proportionate share of the combined monthly net incomes is 56%, but it is reduced to 41% after applying the shared parenting time adjustment for 45% custody under subdivision (c). Mother’s basic child support obligation for these children is $580 ($1,414 x 41%). Offsetting the support obligations consistent with subdivision (d)(1), Mother’s obligation is greater than Father’s obligation, and Father is the obligee receiving the net of the two obligations by subtracting $320 from $580, or $260.

   Official Note

   In cases with more than one child and varied partial or shared custodial schedules, it is not appropriate to perform a separate calculation for each child and offset support amounts as that method does not consider the incremental increases in support for more than one child built into the schedule of basic child support.

   (3)  Combined Child Support and Spousal Support or Alimony Pendente Lite. When Each Party Owes Child Support to the Other Party.

     (i)   When one or more children reside with each party, the trier-of-fact shall offset the obligor’s combined spousal support or alimony pendente lite and basic child support obligations with the obligee’s basic child support obligation.

     (ii)   The trier-of-fact shall award the net difference to the obligee as spousal support or alimony pendente lite and basic child support.

 (e)  Support Obligations When Custodial Parent Owes Spousal Support. If a child is residing with the spouse (custodial parent) obligated to pay spousal support or alimony pendente lite and the other spouse (non-custodial parent) has a legal obligation to support the child, the guideline spousal support or alimony pendente lite obligation is determined by offsetting the non-custodial parent’s basic child support obligation and the custodial parent’s spousal support or alimony pendente lite obligation, and awarding the net difference either to the non-custodial parent as spousal support or alimony pendente lite or to the custodial parent as child support as the circumstances warrant. The calculation is a five-step process:

   (1)  Calculate the custodial parent’s spousal support or alimony pendente lite obligation to the non-custodial parent based on the parties’ monthly net incomes using the ‘‘without dependent children’’ formula in either Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-4(a)(1)(Part B) or (a)(2)(Part IV), as appropriate.

   (2)  Recalculate the parties’ monthly net incomes by adjusting for the spousal support or alimony pendente lite payment paid or received in subdivision (e)(1).

   (3)  Using the recomputed monthly net incomes from subdivision (e)(2), calculate the non-custodial parent’s basic child support obligation to the custodial parent.

   (4)  The final support amount is the difference calculated in subdivision (e)(1) and (e)(3).

     (i)   If the amount in subdivision (e)(1) is greater than the amount in subdivision (e)(3), the final amount is spousal support or alimony pendente lite payable to the non-custodial parent.

     (ii)   If the amount in subdivision (e)(1) is less than the amount in subdivision (e)(3), the final amount is basic child support payable to the custodial parent.

   (5)  If the proceeding is a modification of an order entered before January 1, 2019 that has federal tax consequences associated with spousal support or alimony pendente lite payments and the final order is spousal support or alimony pendente lite as in subdivision (e)(4)(i), the offset spousal support or alimony pendente lite amount is federally taxable, and the trier-of-fact may deviate the final order due to the tax effect, as appropriate.

   Official Note

   See Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.19(h).

Explanatory Comment—2005
   Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-4(a) sets forth the income shares formula used to establish the support obligation. Subdivision (b) provides the method for calculating support for seven or more children as the basic support schedule in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3 sets forth the presumptive amount of support for up to six children.

   Subdivision (c) sets forth the method for calculating the presumptive amount of support in cases where the children spend 40% or more of their time during the year with the obligor. When there is equal time sharing, subdivision (2) reduces the support obligation further so that the obligor does not pay more than is necessary to equalize the parties’ combined monthly net income between the two households. Subdivision (3) expressly excludes SSR cases from the application of this rule. Since the SSR already reduces support to a minimal level, a further reduction should not be given for the amount of time spent with the children.

   Subdivision (d) relates to the calculation of support in divided or split custody cases. It retains the existing method for offsetting the parties’ respective support obligations when one or more of the children resides with each party.

   Subdivision (e) governs spousal support obligations when the custodial parent owes spousal support. It has not been amended, other than to update the example to be consistent with the new schedule at Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3.

Explanatory Comment—2010
   The basic support schedule incorporates an assumption that the children spend 30% of the time with the obligor and that the obligor makes direct expenditures on their behalf during that time. Variable expenditures, such as food and entertainment, that fluctuate based upon parenting time were adjusted in the schedule to build in the assumption of 30% parenting time. Upward deviation should be considered in cases in which the obligor has little or no contact with the children. However, an upward deviation may not be appropriate if an obligor has infrequent overnight contact with the child, but provides meals and entertainment during daytime contact. Fluctuating expenditures should be considered rather than the extent of overnight time. A downward deviation may be appropriate when the obligor incurs substantial fluctuating expenditures during parenting time but has infrequent overnights with the children.

   The calculation in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-4(c) reduces an obligor’s support obligation further if the obligor spends significantly more time with the children. The obligor will receive an additional 10% reduction in the amount of support owed at 40% parenting time, increasing incrementally to a 20% reduction at 50% parenting time. This method still may result in a support obligation even if custody of the children is equally shared. In those cases, the rule provides for a maximum obligation so that the obligee does not receive a larger portion of the parties’ combined monthly net income than the obligor.

Rule 1910.16-5. Support Guidelines. Deviation.
 (a)  Deviation.

   (1)  The trier-of-fact may deviate from the basic child support, spousal support, or alimony pendente lite obligation.

   (2)  If the trier-of-fact determines a deviation is appropriate based on the factors in subdivision (b), the trier-of-fact shall specify on the record or in writing:

     (i)   the calculated basic child support, spousal support, or alimony pendente lite obligation;

     (ii)   the reason for the deviation;

     (iii)   the findings of fact justifying the deviation;

     (iv)   the deviation amount; and

     (v)   in a spousal support or an alimony pendente lite action, the obligation’s duration.

   Official Note

   The deviation applies to the support obligation amount or duration, and not to the party’s monthly net income.

 (b)  Factors. In deciding whether to deviate from the basic child support, spousal support, or alimony pendente lite obligation, the trier-of-fact shall consider:

   (1)  unusual needs and unusual fixed obligations;

   (2)  a party’s other support obligations;

   (3)  other household income;

   (4)  the child’s age;

   (5)  the parties’ relative assets and liabilities;

   (6)  medical expenses not covered by insurance;

   (7)  the parties’ and the child’s standard of living;

   (8)  in a spousal support or alimony pendente lite case, the duration of the marriage from the date of marriage to the date of final separation; and

   (9)  other relevant and appropriate factors, including the child’s best interest.

Explanatory Comment—2005
   Rule 1910.16-5 sets forth the factors for deviation from the presumptive amount of support. Subdivision (c) and subsection (b)(8) permit the court to consider the length of the marriage in determining the amount and duration of a spousal support or alimony pendente lite award. The primary purpose of these provisions is to prevent the unfairness that arises in a short-term marriage when the obligor is required to pay support over a substantially longer period of time than the parties were married and there is little or no opportunity for credit for these payments at the time of equitable distribution.

Explanatory Comment—2010
   The provisions of subdivision (c), which provided that the court must consider the duration of the parties’ marriage in determining the duration of an award of spousal support or alimony pendente lite, were moved to new Rule 1910.16-1(c)(2). The duration of the marriage, from the date of marriage to the date of final separation, remains a factor to consider in determining whether or not deviation from the amount of the award is warranted.

Rule 1910.16-6. Support Guidelines. Basic Support Obligation Adjustments. Additional Expenses Allocation.
 The trier-of-fact may allocate between the parties the additional expenses in subdivisions (a)—(e). Even when a basic support order is inappropriate under the facts of the case, the trier-of-fact may allocate between the parties the additional expenses.

 Except for the subdivisions (b)(4) and (e) expenses, the trier-of-fact shall calculate the parties’ proportionate share of the additional expenses after adjusting the parties’ monthly net income by the spousal support or alimony pendente lite obligation received or paid, and dividing each party’s adjusted monthly net income by the parties’ combined monthly net income. However, the trier-of-fact shall not adjust the parties’ monthly net incomes when apportioning the expenses in child support only cases.

 (a)  Child Care Expenses.

   (1)  The trier-of-fact:

     (i)   shall allocate reasonable child care expenses paid by the parties, if necessary to maintain employment or appropriate education in pursuit of income.

     (ii)   may allocate reasonable child care expenses that would be paid by the parties when the trier-of-fact imputes an earning capacity to a party pursuant to Pa.R.Civ.P. 1910.16-2(d)(4)(i)(D).

   (2)  The trier-of-fact may require that the obligor’s share be added to the basic child support obligation, paid directly to the service provider, or paid directly to the obligee.

   (3)  When a party is receiving a child care subsidy through the Department of Human Services, the expense allocated between the parties is the amount actually paid by the party receiving the subsidy.

   (4)  The party seeking allocation of child care expenses shall provide to the other party the expense’s documentation, such as a receipt or an invoice, promptly after receipt unless the service provider invoices the parties separately for the party’s proportionate share of the expense.

   (5)  The trier-of-fact shall have the discretion to not allocate expenses if documentation is not timely provided to the other party.

   (6)  Except as provided in subdivision (a)(7), the total child care expenses shall be reduced to reflect the federal child care tax credit available to the eligible party, regardless of whether the credit is actually claimed by that party, up to the maximum annual cost allowable under the Internal Revenue Code.

   (7)  If the eligible party is not qualified to receive the credit, the federal child care tax credit shall not be used to reduce the child care expenses subject to allocation between the parties.

 

 (b)  Health Insurance Premium.

   (1)  The trier-of-fact shall allocate the health insurance premium paid by the parties, including the premium attributable to the party paying the premium, provided that a statutory duty of support is owed to the party or child covered by the health insurance.

     (i)   If the party paying the health insurance premium is the obligor, the obligee’s share is deducted from the obligor’s basic support obligation.

     (ii)   If the obligee is paying the health insurance premium, the obligor’s share is added to the obligor’s basic support obligation.

     (iii)   A health insurance premium allocated between the parties shall also include health insurance that is provided and paid by a third-party resident of a party’s household (e.g., step-parent) for a child who is the subject of the support order.

   (2)  The trier-of-fact shall not allocate an employer-paid premium or a premium paid for a party, person, or child to whom no statutory duty of support is owed.

     (i)   If the parties present evidence of the excluded premium’s actual amount—the amount attributed to a party, person, or child not owed a statutory duty of support—the trier-of-fact shall deduct the actual amount excluded from the total premium before allocating the health insurance premium between the parties.

     (ii)   If the parties do not present evidence of the excluded premium’s actual amount, the trier-of-fact shall calculate the excluded amount as follows:

       (A)   determine the premium’s cost per person by dividing the total premium by the number of persons covered under the policy;

       (B)   multiply the cost per person by the number of persons who are not owed a statutory duty of support, or are not parties to, or the subject of, the support action; and

       (C)   the resulting amount is excluded from allocation.

 

   (3)  Pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S. §  4326(a), in every support proceeding, the trier-of-fact shall ascertain a parent’s ability to provide medical support for the parties’ child and the support ‘‘order shall include a requirement for medical support to be provided by either or both parents, provided that such medical support is accessible to the children.’’

     (i)   The obligor bears the initial responsibility of providing the child’s health care coverage if it is available at a reasonable cost.

       (A)   ‘‘Reasonable cost’’ to an obligor shall be defined as an amount that does not exceed 5% of the obligor’s monthly net income and, when added to the basic child support obligation plus additional expenses the obligor is ordered to pay, does not exceed 50% of the obligor’s monthly net income.

       (B)   If the obligee is providing the coverage, the ‘‘reasonable cost’’ of the obligor’s share shall be defined as an amount that does not exceed 5% of the obligor’s monthly net income and, when added to the basic child support obligation plus additional expenses the obligor is ordered to pay, does not exceed 50% of the obligor’s monthly net income.

     (ii)   Unless the child’s health care coverage is provided by the obligee or a third party, the court shall issue the National Medical Support Notice required by 23 Pa.C.S. §  4326(d.1) to the obligor’s employer in response to notification that the obligor is employed.

       (A)   The notice shall direct the employer to enroll the obligor’s child who is the subject of the support proceeding if the coverage is available at a reasonable cost to the obligor.

       (B)   However, the notice shall direct that enrollment shall not occur earlier than 25 days from the date of the National Medical Support Notice to allow the obligor time to object.

       (C)   Concurrent with the issuance of the National Medical Support Notice, the court shall provide notice to the obligor setting forth the process to object to the enrollment based upon unreasonable cost, mistake of fact, or availability of alternative health care coverage for the child.

       (D)   If there is more than one employer-provided health care coverage option, the obligor shall select the coverage, subject to the obligee’s right to seek a court order designating a different option.

     (iii)   Absent the availability of health care coverage to the obligor for the parties’ child at a reasonable cost, the court shall order the obligee to provide health care coverage for the child if it is available at a reasonable cost. ‘‘Reasonable cost’’ to the obligee shall be defined as an amount not to exceed 5% of the obligee’s monthly net income.

     (iv)   If health care coverage is not available to the parties at a reasonable cost, the court may order the party having primary custody to apply for government-sponsored coverage, such as the Children’s Health Insurance Program (‘‘CHIP’’), with any co-premium or other cost apportioned between the parties in proportion to the parties’ respective monthly net incomes.

     (v)   Within 30 days after the entry of the support order, the party ordered to provide health care coverage shall provide written proof to the other party that medical insurance has been obtained, including insurance cards and all other materials set forth in the form order in Pa.R.Civ.P. 1910.27(e). There shall be a continuing obligation to provide the other party and the domestic relations section with proof of any changes in coverage.

     (vi)   The trier-of-fact shall give preference to health care coverage that is readily accessible to the child, as defined by geographic coverage area, access to local treatment providers, or other relevant factors.

 

   (4)  If the obligor is paying for the health insurance, the obligee has no income or minimal income, and the obligor will bear 90% or more of the health insurance premium:

     (i)   the trier-of-fact may, as fairness requires, deduct part or all of the premium actually paid by the obligor to provide coverage for the other party or the child from the obligor’s gross income to determine monthly net income for support purposes.

     (ii)   If such a deduction is taken from the obligor’s gross income, the premium allocation as set forth in subdivision (b)(1) shall not be applied.

 (c)  Reasonable Unreimbursed Medical Expenses. The trier-of-fact shall allocate the obligee’s or child’s reasonable unreimbursed medical expenses. However, the trier-of-fact shall not allocate reasonable unreimbursed medical expenses incurred by a party who is not owed a statutory duty of support by the other party. The trier-of-fact may require that the obligor’s expense share be included in the basic support obligation, paid directly to the health care provider, or paid directly to the obligee.

   (1)  Medical Expenses.

     (i)   For purposes of this subdivision, medical expenses are annual unreimbursed medical expenses in excess of $250 per person.

     (ii)   Medical expenses include insurance co-payments and deductibles and all expenses reasonably incurred for necessary medical services and supplies, including but not limited to surgical, dental, and optical services, psychiatric and psychological services, and orthodontia.

     (iii)   Medical expenses do not include cosmetic, chiropractic, or other services unless specifically directed in the order of court.

   (2)  The trier-of-fact may impose an annual limitation when the burden on the obligor would otherwise be excessive.

   (3)  Annual expenses shall be calculated on a calendar year basis.

     (i)   In the year in which the initial support order is entered, or in any period in which support is being paid that is less than a full year, the $250 threshold shall be pro-rated.

     (ii)   The party seeking allocation for an unreimbursed medical expense shall provide to the other party the expense’s documentation, such as a receipt or an invoice, promptly upon receipt, but not later than March 31st of the year following the calendar year in which the final bill was received by the party seeking allocation.

     (iii)   For purposes of subsequent enforcement, unreimbursed medical bills need not be submitted to the domestic relations section prior to March 31st.

     (iv)   The trier-of-fact shall have the discretion to not allocate an expense if documentation is not timely provided to the other party.

   (4)  If the trier-of-fact determines that out-of-network unreimbursed medical expenses were not obtained due to medical emergency or other compelling factors, the trier-of-fact may deem those expenses to be unreasonable and decline to assess the expenses against the other party.

 

 (d)  Private School Tuition or Summer Camp. Other Additional Expenses. Expenses outside the scope of typical child-rearing expenses, such as private school tuition, summer camp fees, and other additional expenses as set forth in subdivision (d)(2), have not been factored into the Basic Child Support Schedule.

   (1)  Private School Tuition or Summer Camp. If the trier-of-fact determines that private school or summer camp is reasonable under the parties’ circumstances, the trier-of-fact shall apportion the expense to the parties.

   (2)  Other Additional Expenses. The trier-of-fact shall apportion an additional expense to the parties, if the trier-of-fact determines that the expense:

     (i)   is related to the child’s educational, extra-curricular, or developmental activities; and

     (ii)   is reasonable under the parties’ circumstances.

   (3)  The trier-of-fact may require that a party’s proportionate share of a subdivision (d)(1) or (d)(2) expense is:

     (i)   included in or excluded from the basic child support obligation;

     (ii)   paid directly to the service provider; or

     (iii)   paid directly to the other party.

   (4)  Documentation.

     (i)   The party seeking allocation of an expense shall provide the other party with the expense’s documentation, such as a receipt or an invoice, promptly upon receipt, but not later than March 31st of the year following the calendar year in which the party incurred the expense, unless the service provider invoices the parties separately.

     (ii)   For subsequent enforcement purposes, a party does not need to submit the expense’s documentation to the domestic relations section before March 31.

     (iii)   The trier-of-fact shall have the discretion to not allocate an expense if documentation is not timely provided to the other party.

 (e)  Mortgage Payment. The support guidelines assume that the spouse occupying the marital residence will be solely responsible for the mortgage payment, real estate taxes, and homeowners’ insurance. Similarly, the trier-of-fact shall assume that the party occupying the marital residence will be paying the items listed unless the recommendation specifically provides otherwise.

   (1)  If the obligee is living in the marital residence and the mortgage payment exceeds 25% of the obligee’s monthly net income (including amounts of spousal support, alimony pendente lite, and child support), the trier-of-fact may require the obligor to assume up to 50% of the excess amount in the obligor’s support obligation.

   (2)  If the obligor is occupying the marital residence and the mortgage payment exceeds 25% of the obligor’s monthly net income (less any amount of spousal support, alimony pendente lite, and child support the obligor is paying), the trier-of-fact may downwardly adjust the obligor’s support obligation.

   (3)  This rule shall not be applicable after a final resolution of the outstanding economic claims in the parties’ divorce action.

   (4)  For purposes of this subdivision, ‘‘mortgage’’ shall include a first mortgage, real estate taxes, and homeowners’ insurance and may include a subsequent mortgage, a home equity loan, and other marital obligations secured by the marital residence.

Comment:
   Subdivision (a)(1)(i) Example: Mother has primary custody of the parties’ two children and Father has partial custody. The parties’ respective monthly net incomes are $2,000 and $3,500. At the combined monthly net income of $5,500 for two children, the basic child support obligation is $1,567. As Father’s income represents 64% of the parties’ combined monthly net income, Father’s basic child support obligation is $1,003. Mother incurs monthly child care expenses of $400, and Father incurs $100 per month. The total child care expenses, $500, will be apportioned between the parties, with Father paying 64%, or $320. As Father is paying $100 for the children’s child care during his partial custody, he would pay the remaining $220 to Mother for a total child support obligation of $1,223 ($1,003 + $220).

   Subdivision (b) does not apply to Medical Assistance. See 23 Pa.C.S. §  4326(l).

   Subdivision (b)(1)-(b)(2) Example 1: If the parties are separated, but not divorced, and Husband pays $200 monthly for employer-provided health insurance for himself, Wife, the parties’ child, and two additional children from a previous marriage, the premium attributable to the additional two children, if not otherwise verifiable or known with reasonable ease and certainty, is calculated by dividing $200 by five persons and then multiplying the resulting amount of $40 per person by the two additional children, for a total of $80 to be excluded from allocation. Deduct this amount from the total premium to arrive at the premium to be allocated between the parties—$120. Since Husband is paying the premium, and spouses have a statutory duty to support one another pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S. §  4321, Wife’s percentage share of the $120 is deducted from Husband’s support obligation. If Wife had been providing the coverage, Husband’s percentage share would be added to his basic support obligation.

   Subdivision (b)(1)-(b)(2) Example 2: If the parties are divorced and Father pays $200 monthly for employer-provided health insurance for himself, the parties’ child, and two additional children from a previous marriage, the premium attributable to Father and the two additional children will not be allocated between the parties. Thus, using the same calculations in Example 1, the premium attributable to Father and the two other children is $150 ($200 premium divided among four covered persons equals $50 per person multiplied by three) and that amount is deducted from the total premium, leaving $50 ($200 - $150 = $50) to be allocated between the parties.

   Subdivision (b)(1)-(b)(2) Example 3: The parties are divorced, and Mother is the obligee of a child support order. Father, the obligor, pays $200 monthly for employer-provided health insurance for himself and the parties’ child. Mother pays $400 per month for her employer-provided health insurance that covers only herself. The premium Father pays to cover the parties’ child, $100 ($200 premium divided between two covered persons, Father and the child), will be allocated between the parties in proportion to their respective monthly net incomes. The premium that covers Father will not be allocated because the parties are no longer married, and he is not owed a duty of support by Mother. The premium Mother pays to provide her own coverage will not be allocated because the parties are no longer married and she is not owed a duty of support by Father.

   Concerning subdivision (b)(3), the maximum amount of any attachment for child and medical support is set forth by the federal Consumer Credit Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. § §  1601 et seq.

   Subdivision (c) is intended to implement 23 Pa.C.S. §  4326(e).

   An unreimbursed medical expense may be unreasonable if it was an avoidable expense incurred solely by the party requesting reimbursement, e.g., expenses for missed office visits, excessive supplies, purchases of name brand medications when generic medications are suitable and available, denial of insurance coverage because of a failure to comply with plan requirements, or non-emergency out-of-network expenses pursuant to subdivision (c)(4).

   The determination of medical necessity of a medical service or medical supplies can be made in a support proceeding or a custody proceeding. Even if challenged during a support proceeding (rather than a custody proceeding), the necessity of a medical service or medical supplies, which results in an unreimbursed medical expense for which a party seeks allocation subject to subdivision (c)(1)(ii), should be determined by the trier-of-fact, and subject to review by a judge if the trier-of-fact is not a judge.

   If the trier-of-fact determines that a party acted reasonably in obtaining services that were not specifically set forth in the order of support, payment for such services may be ordered retroactively.

   Pursuant to subdivision (c)(1)(iii), medical expenses for cosmetic, chiropractic, or other services may be, but are not required to be, allocated between the parties by the trier-of-fact if such expenses are reasonable and necessary.

Historical Commentary
   The following commentary is historical in nature and represents statements of the Committee at the time of rulemaking:

Explanatory Comment—2004
   Subdivision (a), relating to the federal child care tax credit, has been amended to reflect recent amendments to the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. §  21. By generally referencing the Tax Code, rather than incorporating current Code provisions in the rule, further amendments will be incorporated into the support calculation.

Explanatory Comment—2005
   Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-6 governs the treatment of additional expenses that warrant an adjustment to the basic support obligation.

   Subdivision (a) relates to child care expenses. Subdivision (a) has been amended to require that child care expenses incurred by either party are to be allocated between the parties in proportion to their respective net incomes. Subsection (a)(1), relating to the federal child care tax credit, was amended in 2004 to reflect recent amendments to the Internal Revenue Code. 26 U.S.C. §  21. By referring to the Tax Code in general, rather than incorporating current Code provisions in the rule, any further amendments will be incorporated into the support calculation. Since the tax credit may be taken only against taxes owed, it cannot be used when the eligible parent does not incur sufficient tax liability to fully realize the credit. For this reason, subsection (2) provides that no adjustment to the total child care expenses may be made if the eligible parent does not qualify to receive the credit.

   Subdivision (b) addresses health insurance premiums. The cost of the premiums is generally treated as an additional expense to be allocated between the parties in proportion to their net incomes. Subdivision (b)(1) of the rule permits allocation of the entire premium, including the portion of the premium covering the party carrying the insurance, when the insurance benefits the other party and/or the children. Subdivision (b)(2) clarifies that, in calculating the amount of the health care premium to be allocated between the parties, subdivision (b)(1) requires the inclusion of that portion of the health insurance premium covering the party who is paying the premium, so long as there is a statutory duty of support owed to that party, but not the portion of the premium attributable to non-parties and children who are not the subjects of the support order. Subdivision (b)(2) provides for proration of the premium when the health insurance covers other persons who are not subject to the support action or owed a statutory duty of support. Subdivision (b) also permits an alternative method for dealing with the cost of health insurance premiums in certain circumstances. While, in general, the cost of the premiums will be treated as an additional expense to be allocated between the parties in proportion to their net incomes, in cases in which the obligee has no income or minimal income, subsection (4) authorizes the trier-of-fact to reduce the obligor’s gross income for support purposes by some or all of the amount of the health insurance premiums. This is to avoid the result under a prior rule in which the entire cost of health insurance would have been borne by the obligor, with no resulting reduction in the amount of support he or she would otherwise be required to pay under the support guidelines. The goal of this provision is to encourage and facilitate the maintenance of health insurance coverage for dependents by giving the obligor a financial incentive to maintain health insurance coverage.

   Subdivision (c) deals with unreimbursed medical expenses. Since the first $250 of medical expenses per year per child is built into the basic guideline amount in the child support schedule, only medical expenses in excess of $250 per year per child are subject to allocation under this rule as an additional expense to be added to the basic support obligation. The same is true with respect to spousal support so that the obligee-spouse is expected to assume the first $250 per year of these expenses and may seek contribution under this rule only for unreimbursed expenses which exceed $250 per year. The definition of ‘‘medical expenses’’ includes insurance co-payments, deductibles and orthodontia and excludes chiropractic services.

   Subdivision (d) governs apportionment of private school tuition, summer camp and other unusual needs not reflected in the basic guideline amounts of support. The rule presumes allocation in proportion to the parties’ net incomes consistent with the treatment of the other additional expenses.

   Subdivision (e) provides for the apportionment of mortgage expenses. It defines ‘‘mortgage’’ to include the real estate taxes and homeowners’ insurance. While real estate taxes and homeowners’ insurance must be included if the trier-of-fact applies the provisions of this subdivision, the inclusion of second mortgages, home equity loans and other obligations secured by the marital residence is within the trier-of-fact’s discretion based upon the circumstances of the case.

Explanatory Comment—2006
   A new introductory sentence in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-6 clarifies that additional expenses contemplated in the rule may be allocated between the parties even if the parties’ respective incomes do not warrant an award of basic support. Thus, even if application of either formula Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-4 results in a basic support obligation of zero, the trier-of-fact may enter a support order allocating between the parties any or all of the additional expenses addressed in this rule.

   The amendment of subdivision (e) recognizes that the obligor may be occupying the marital residence and that, in particular circumstances, justice and fairness may warrant an adjustment in his or her support obligation.

Explanatory Comment—2008
   Federal and state statutes require clarification to subdivision (b) to ensure that all court orders for support address the children’s ongoing need for medical care. In those instances where the children’s health care needs are paid by the state’s medical assistance program, and eligibility for the Children’s Health Insurance Program (‘‘CHIP’’) is denied due to the minimal income of the custodial parent, the obligor remains required to enroll the parties’ children in health insurance that is, or may become, available that is reasonable in cost.

   Government-sponsored health care plans represent a viable alternative to the often prohibitive cost of health insurance obtainable by a parent. Except for very low income children, every child is eligible for CHIP, for which the parent with primary physical custody must apply and which is based on that parent’s income. A custodial parent may apply for CHIP by telephone or on the Internet. While co-premiums or co-pays increase as the custodial parent’s income increases, such costs are generally modest and should be apportioned between the parties. Moreover, health care coverage obtained by the custodial parent generally yields more practical results, as the custodial parent resides in the geographic coverage area, enrollment cards are issued directly to the custodial parent, and claims may be submitted directly by the custodial parent.

Explanatory Comment—2010
   Subdivision (e), relating to mortgages on the marital residence, has been amended to clarify that the rule cannot be applied after a final order of equitable distribution has been entered. To the extent that Isralsky v. Isralsky, 824 A.2d 1178 (Pa. Super. 2003), holds otherwise, it is superseded. At the time of resolution of the parties’ economic claims, the former marital residence will either have been awarded to one of the parties or otherwise addressed.

Explanatory Comment—2018
   The amendments provide for an adjustment to the parties’ monthly net incomes prior to determining the percentage each party pays toward the expenses set forth in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-6. Previously, the Rules of Civil Procedure apportioned the enumerated expenses in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-6(a)—(d), with the exception of subdivision (c)(5), between the parties based on the parties’ respective monthly net incomes as calculated pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-2. This apportionment did not consider the amount of support paid by the obligor or received by the obligee.

   The amended rule adjusts the parties’ monthly net incomes, upward or downward, by the spousal support/APL amount paid or received by that party prior to apportioning the expenses. This methodology is not new to the Rules of Civil Procedure. In Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-6(c)(5) (rescinded), the parties’ monthly net incomes in spousal support/APL-only cases were similarly adjusted prior to the apportionment of unreimbursed medical expenses. Likewise, Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-6(e) considers the parties’ monthly net income after the receipt or payment of the support obligation for purposes of determining a mortgage deviation. As the new procedure adopts the methodology in former subdivision (c)(5), that subdivision has been rescinded as delineating the spousal support only circumstance is unnecessary.

   Lastly, the amendment consolidates Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-6(b)(1), (2), and (2.1).

Rule 1910.16-7. Support Guidelines. Multiple Family Child Support Obligations.
 (a)  When an obligor’s basic child support obligations total 50% or less of the obligor’s monthly net income, there will be no deviation from the basic support obligation on the ground of the existence of a new family.

  Example: If the obligor requests a reduction of support for one child of the first marriage on the basis that there is a new child of the second intact marriage, and the relevant monthly net incomes are $2,500 for the obligor, $500 for the former spouse, and $1,300 for the current spouse, the request for a reduction will be denied because the obligor’s basic support obligations total $1,138 ($576 for the first child and $562 for the second child) and are less than half of the obligor’s monthly net income.

 (b)  When the total of the obligor’s basic support obligations exceeds 50% of the obligor’s monthly net income, the trier-of-fact may proportionately reduce the basic support obligations.

   (1)  The goal of the guidelines is to treat each child equitably, and a first or later family shall not receive preference.

   (2)  The trier-of-fact shall not divide the basic child support obligations for all of the obligor’s children among the households in which those children live.

  Example 1. The obligor is sued for support of an out-of-wedlock child. The obligor is already paying support for two children of the first marriage, and has an intact second marriage with one child. The relevant monthly net incomes are $3,800 for the obligor, $1,100 for the former spouse, $0 for the current spouse, and $1,500 for the parent of the new child. The obligor’s basic child support obligations to each family are $1,140 for the two children of the first marriage, $854 for the one child of the second marriage, and $743 for the one child out of wedlock for a total of $2,737. Since the total of these obligations exceeds 50% of the obligor’s monthly net income of $3,800, the trier-of-fact may consider a proportional reduction of the orders.

  Example 2. The obligor is sued for support of three children of a second marriage. There is already an order in effect for two children of the first marriage. The relevant monthly net incomes are $2,500 for the obligor, $0 for the first spouse, and $500 for the second spouse. The obligor’s basic child support obligation to each family is $877 for the two children of the first marriage and $1,040 for the three children of the second marriage for a total support obligation of $1,917. Since the total obligation leaves the obligor with only $583 on which to live, the orders are too high as the obligor must be left with a Self-Support Reserve of $1,063. However, reducing the order for three children while leaving the existing order intact would give preference to the first family, contrary to the rule. Therefore, both orders shall be reduced proportionally.

  Example 3. The obligor is sued by three obligees to establish orders for three children. The monthly net income for the obligor and for each obligee is $1,500. The trier-of-fact would determine that the obligor’s basic child support obligation for each child is $346 for a total of $1,038 for three children. It would be incorrect to determine the basic child support obligation for three children, in this case $1,253, and divide that amount among the three children. As the obligations exceed 50% of the obligor’s monthly net income, the support orders should be reduced proportionately consistent with subdivision (b) and ensure the obligor retains the Self-Support Reserve of $1,063 consistent with Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-2(e).

 (c)  Presumptive Basic Support Obligation.

   (1)  For purposes of this rule, the obligor’s presumptive basic support obligation:

     (i)   is calculated using only the formula in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-4; and

     (ii)   does not include any additional expenses that may be added pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-6.

   (2)  In calculating the obligor’s presumptive basic support obligation, the trier-of-fact shall ensure that the obligor retains at least $1,063 per month consistent with Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-2(e).

  Example 1. Assume that the obligor is paying $553 per month support for one child of the first marriage, plus an additional $200 per month for child care expenses. The obligor requests a reduction in this support obligation on the basis that there is one new child of the second intact marriage. The relevant incomes are $2,400 for the obligor and $0 for the former and current spouses. The obligor’s request for a reduction shall be denied because the total of the basic support obligations for both children is only $1,106 ($553 for each child) and does not exceed 50% of the obligor’s monthly net income. A reduction shall not be given on the basis that the obligor’s contribution to child care expenses for the first child results in an total basic support child obligation of $1,306, which exceeds 50% of the obligor’s monthly net income. The presumptive basic child support obligations for the two children still total $1,106 ($553 for each child). The trier-of-fact shall consider the deviation factors under Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-5 and the parties’ respective contributions to additional expenses under Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-6 in arriving at an appropriate total child support obligation for each child.

  

   Example 2. Assume that the obligor is paying $346 per month support for one child of the first marriage. The obligor has one new child of the second intact marriage. The relevant incomes are $1,500 for the obligor and $0 for the former and current spouses. A reduction shall not be given on the basis of the obligor’s new child because the presumptive basic child support obligations total $692 ($346 for each child) and this amount does not exceed 50% of the obligor’s monthly net income. Since, however, this amount leaves the obligor with only $808 per month, the trier-of-fact shall proportionally reduce the basic child support obligations so that the obligor retains $1,063 per month. The presumptive basic child support obligations total $437 ($218.50 for each child). The trier-of-fact shall consider the deviation factors under Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-5 and the parties’ respective contributions to additional expenses under Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-6 in arriving at an appropriate total child support obligation for each child.

Explanatory Comment—2010
   Rule 1910.16-7 has been amended to reflect the updated schedule in Rule 1910.16-3 and the increase in the Self-Support Reserve to $867 per month, the 2008 federal poverty level for one person. The distribution priorities formerly in subdivision (d) have been moved to Rule 1910.17(d) to clarify that these priorities apply to all support orders, not just those involving multiple families.

Explanatory Comment—2013
   Rule 1910.16-7 has been amended to reflect the updated schedule in Rule 1910.16-3 and the increase in the Self-Support Reserve to $931 per month, the 2012 federal poverty level for one person.

Rule 1910.17. Support Order. Effective Date. Change of Circumstances. Copies of Order. Priority of Distribution of Payments.
 (a)  An order of support shall be effective from the date of the filing of the complaint or petition for modification unless the order specifies otherwise. In a child support case, if a change in custody occurs after the date of filing, but before a domestic relations conference is held, the trier of fact shall enter a charging order going forward in favor of the primary custodian that shall be effective from the date of the change in custody. The trier of fact also may enter a retroactive arrears order in favor of the party who was the primary custodian at the time of filing. Such an order may address the period from the date of fining to the date of the change in custody. However, a modification of an existing support order may be retroactive to a date preceding the date of filing if the petitioner was precluded from filing a petition for modification by reason of a significant physical or mental disability, misrepresentation of another party or other compelling reason and if the petitioner, when no longer precluded, promptly filed a petition.

  Example: Mother has primary custody of the children and files for child support. Two months later, Father becomes the primary custodian. One month after the change in custody, a support conference is held. Father will be the obligee on a charging order that is retroactive to the date he became the primary custodian. However, an order also may be entered with Mother as the obligee for the two-month period from the date of filing to the date of the change in custody.

   Official Note

   The order must direct payment to be made payable to or payment to be made to the State Collection and Disbursement Unit for transmission to the obligee. See 23 Pa.C.S. §  4325.

   Subdivision (a) was amended in 2005 to include the statutory provision at 23 Pa.C.S. §  4352(e) that authorizes the court to enter a modified order that is effective to a date prior to the date on which the petition for modification was filed in certain circumstances. To the effect that the holding in Kelleher v. Bush, 832 A.2d 483 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2003), is inconsistent, it is superseded. See 23 Pa.C.S. §  4352(e) for additional provisions.

 Every order of support must contain an immediate or conditional order for the attachment of income. See Rule 1910.21.

 (b) The order shall notify the obligee and the obligor that each is under a continuing obligation to inform the domestic relations section in writing or by personal appearance and all other parties in writing within seven days of any material change in circumstances relevant to the level of support or the administration of the support order, including, but not limited to, loss or change of income or employment and change of personal address or change of address of any child receiving support. The order shall also notify the parties that if a party willfully fails to inform the domestic relations section of the required information, the court may adjudge the party to be in contempt of court pursuant to Rules 1910.25 through 1910.25-6 and may order the party to be punished by one or more of the following: jail, fine or probation.

 (c)  A copy of the support order shall be provided to each party to the action and to the party’s attorney, if any, pursuant to Rule 440.

 (d)  The priorities for distribution of payments and/or collections from the obligor, without regard to the source of the funds or method of collection, are as follows:

   (1)  monthly current child support.

   (2)  medical, child care or other court-ordered child support-related expenses.

   (3)  monthly ordered amount toward child support arrears.

   (4)  monthly current spousal support or alimony pendente lite.

   (5)  remaining child support arrears.

   (6)  monthly ordered amount toward spousal support or alimony pendente lite arrears.

   (7)  remaining spousal support or alimony pendente lite arrears.

   (8)  court costs and fees.

Explanatory Comment—2010
   Subdivision (d) has been moved from Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-7 and expanded for clarification. It addresses the priority of the distribution of payments and collections in all cases, not just those involving multiple families. However, collections realized through the interception of federal tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service are subject to federal distribution priorities. See 45 CFR §  303.72(h). An unallocated order for child support and spousal support or child support and alimony pendente lite has the same priority as a child support order.

Rule 1910.19. Support. Modification. Termination. Guidelines as Substantial Change in Circumstances. Overpayments.
 (a)  A petition for modification or termination of an existing support order shall specifically aver the material and substantial change in circumstances upon which the petition is based. A new guideline amount resulting from new or revised support guidelines may constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances. The existence of additional income, income sources or assets identified through automated methods or otherwise may also constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances.

 (b)  The procedure upon the petition shall be in accordance with Rule 1910.10 et seq. After a party has filed a petition for modification of a child support order, the petition may not be withdrawn unless both parties consent or with leave of court. A petition for modification of spousal support or alimony pendente lite may be withdrawn without the consent of the other party or leave of court.

 (c)  Pursuant to a petition for modification, the trier-of-fact may modify or terminate the existing support order in any appropriate manner based on the evidence presented without regard to which party filed the petition for modification. If the trier-of-fact finds that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances, the order may be increased or decreased based on the parties’ respective monthly net incomes, consistent with the support guidelines, existing law, and Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.18(d), and the party’s custodial time with the child at the time the modification petition is heard.

 (d)  All charging orders for spousal support and alimony pendente lite shall terminate upon the death of the payee spouse.

 (e)  Within six months prior to the date a child who is the subject of a child support order reaches eighteen (18) years of age, the domestic relations section shall issue an emancipation inquiry and notice to the obligee, with a copy to the obligor, seeking the following information:

   (1)  confirmation of the child’s date of birth, date of graduation or withdrawal from high school;

   (2)  whether the child has left the obligee’s household and, if so, the date of departure;

   (3)  the existence of any agreement between the parties requiring payments for the benefit of the child after the child has reached age eighteen (18) or graduated from high school; and

   (4)  any special needs of the child which may be a basis for continuing support for that child beyond the child’s eighteenth birthday or graduation from high school, whichever is last to occur.

 The notice shall advise the obligee that if the inquiry is not returned within thirty (30) days of mailing or if there is no agreement or the child does not have any special needs, the charging order may be modified or terminated by the court. In order to avoid overpayment, when no other children are subjects of the child support order and the obligee either does not return the emancipation inquiry within thirty (30) days of its mailing or does not assert grounds for continuing support for the child, then the domestic relations section shall administratively terminate the child support charging order without further proceedings on the last to occur of the date the last child reaches age eighteen (18) or graduates from high school. Termination of the charging order shall not affect any arrears accrued through the date of termination. The court shall have the authority to enter an order requiring the obligor to pay on arrears in an amount equal to the amount of the charging order until all arrears are paid.

 If the order applies to another child or children and/or the obligee asserts that there is an agreement between the parties or that a child has special needs requiring continued support, then the domestic relations section may schedule a conference prior to the child’s attaining age 18 or graduating from high school to determine if the charging order should be modified.

 (f)  Upon notice to the obligee, with a copy to the obligor, explaining the basis for the proposed modification or termination, the court may modify or terminate a charging order for support and remit any arrears, all without prejudice, when it appears to the court that:

   (1)  the order is no longer able to be enforced under state law; or

   (2)  the obligor is unable to pay, has no known income or assets and there is no reasonable prospect that the obligor will be able to pay in the foreseeable future.

 The notice shall advise the obligee to contact the domestic relations section within 60 days of the date of the mailing of the notice if the obligee wishes to contest the proposed modification or termination. If the obligee objects, the domestic relations section shall schedule a conference to provide the obligee the opportunity to contest the proposed action. If the obligee does not respond to the notice or object to the proposed action, the court shall have the authority to modify or terminate the order and remit any arrears, without prejudice.

 (g)  Overpayments.

   (1)  Order in Effect. If there is an overpayment in an amount in excess of two months of the monthly support obligation and a charging order remains in effect, after notice to the parties as set forth below, the domestic relations section shall reduce the charging order by 20% or an amount sufficient to retire the overpayment by the time the charging order is terminated. The notice shall advise the parties to contact the domestic relations section within 30 days of the date of the mailing of the notice if either or both of them wishes to contest the proposed reduction of the charging order. If either party objects, the domestic relations section shall schedule a conference to provide the objecting party the opportunity to contest the proposed action. If neither party responds to the notice or objects to the proposed action, the domestic relations section shall have the authority to reduce the charging order.

   (2)  Order Terminated. If there is an overpayment in any amount and there is no charging order in effect, within one year of the termination of the charging order, the former obligor may file a petition with the domestic relations section seeking recovery of the overpayment. A copy shall be served upon the former obligee as original process. The domestic relations section shall schedule a conference on the petition, which shall be conducted consistent with the rules governing support actions. The domestic relations section shall have the authority to enter an order against the former obligee for the amount of the overpayment in a monthly amount to be determined by the trier of fact after consideration of the former obligee’s ability to pay.

 (h)  Modification of a Support Order with Child Support and Spousal Support or Child Support and Alimony Pendente Lite Entered Before January 1, 2019.

   (1)  In a subsequent modification proceeding of an order awarding child support and spousal support or child support and alimony pendente lite, as provided in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.18(d), the trier-of-fact may on its own motion or upon the motion of a party:

     (i)   make an unallocated award in favor of the spouse and one or more children; or

     (ii)   state the support amount allocable to the spouse and to each child.

   (2)  The trier-of-fact shall clearly state whether the order is allocated or unallocated even if the child support and spousal support or child support and alimony pendente lite amounts are delineated in the order.

     (i)   If the order is allocated, the Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910-16.4(a)(2)(Part IV) formula determines the spousal support amount.

       (A)   As the formula assumes an unallocated order, if the order’s allocation utilizing the formula is inequitable, the trier-of-fact may adjust the order, as appropriate.

       (B)   In making an adjustment, the trier-of-fact shall consider the federal income tax consequences.

       (C)   If the parties are in higher income brackets, the income tax considerations are likely to be a more significant factor in determining a support amount.

     (ii)   If the order is unallocated or the order is for spousal support or alimony pendente lite only, the trier-of-fact shall not consider the federal income tax consequences.

   Official Note

   See 23 Pa.C.S. §  4348(d) for additional matters that must be specified in a support order if arrearages exist when the order is entered.

   (3)  A support award for a spouse and children is taxable to the obligee while an award for the children only is not. Consequently, in certain situations, an award only for the children will be more favorable to the obligee than an award to the spouse and children. In this situation, the trier-of-fact should utilize the method that provides the greatest benefit to the obligee.

   (4)  If the obligee’s monthly net income is equal to or greater than the obligor’s monthly net income, the guideline amount for spouse and children is identical to the guideline amount for children only. Therefore, in cases involving support for spouse and children, whenever the obligee’s monthly net income is equal to or greater than the obligor’s monthly net income, the guideline amount indicated shall be attributed to child support only.

   (5)  Unallocated child support and spousal support or child support and alimony pendente lite orders shall terminate upon the obligee’s death.

   (6)  In the event that the obligor defaults on an unallocated order, the trier-of-fact shall allocate the order for child support collection pursuant to the Internal Revenue Service income tax refund intercept program or for registration and enforcement of the order in another jurisdiction under the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act, 23 Pa.C.S. § §  7101—7903. The trier-of-fact shall provide the parties with notice of allocation.

   Official Note

    This provision is necessary to comply with various state and federal laws relating to child support enforcement. It is not intended to affect an unallocated order’s tax consequences.

   (7)  An unallocated child support and spousal support or child support and alimony pendente lite order is a final order as to the claims covered in the order.

   (8)  Motions for post-trial relief cannot be filed to the final order.

   Official Note

   The procedure relating to Motions for Reconsideration is set forth in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1930.2.

   Subdivision (h) incorporates Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16 (rescinded) and Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-4(f)(rescinded) for subsequent modification proceedings due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Pub.L. No. 115-97).

Explanatory Comment—1993
   Existence of Guidelines as Substantial Change in Circumstances. In its opinion in Newman v. Newman, 409 Pa. Super. Ct. 108, 597 A.2d 684 (Pa. Super. 1991), the Superior Court held that enactment of the guidelines does not constitute a substantial change in circumstance which could serve as the basis for modification of a support order. The amended rule allows the trier of fact to consider new or revised rules as a change in circumstances where the change in the guidelines, either by itself or in combination with other factors, is material and substantial.

Explanatory Comment—2000
   The Pennsylvania Child Support Enforcement System (‘‘PACSES’’) is electronically linked to a variety of governmental and private agencies and institutions. This linkage enables PACSES to immediately locate and identify an obligor’s income, income sources and assets. Rule 1910.19 is amended to provide that their identification through these automated methods provides a basis for modifying both the current support obligation and the rate of repayment on either past due or overdue support. Identification through means other than PACSES continues to provide the same basis for modification.

   While identification of income sources or assets provides a basis for modification, this rule is not intended to prevent a court from ordering that the income or assets be frozen and seized under Rule 1910.26 pending the hearing on the petition for modification. Such relief remains available under Rule 1910.26 governing appropriate interim or special relief. See Rule 1910.1 Explanatory Comment. Nor is this rule intended to affect the court’s ability to seize income or assets under Rule 1910.20 to secure an overdue support obligation.

Explanatory Comment—2002
   Although support orders do not terminate automatically, many obligors are unaware of the necessity of filing a petition to terminate a child support order when the child becomes emancipated. As a result, old orders have continued to charge long after the subject child has become an adult. New subdivision (e) is intended to address this problem by giving the obligee notice of a proposed modification or termination of the order and the opportunity to object. If no objection is made, or if the obligee fails to respond with a reason to continue the order, the rule gives the court the authority to terminate or modify the charging order, depending upon whether or not other children are covered under the order.

Explanatory Comment—2006
   New subdivision (f) addresses an increasing multiplicity of circumstances in which the continued existence of a court-ordered obligation of support is inconsistent with rules or law. An obligor with no known assets whose sole source of income is Supplemental Security Income or cash assistance cannot be ordered to pay support under Rule 1910.16-2. Likewise, an obligor with no verifiable income or assets whose institutionalization, incarceration or long-term disability precludes the payment of support renders the support order unenforceable and uncollectible, diminishing the perception of the court as a source of redress and relief. Often, the obligor is unable or unaware of the need to file for a modification or termination, or the parties abandon the action. In those circumstances, the courts are charged with managing dockets with no viable outcomes. Both the rules and the federal guidelines for child support under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act provide for circumstances under which a support order shall not be entered or under which a child support case may be closed. Subdivision (f) expands the authority of the courts to respond to case management issues brought about by changes in circumstances of the parties of which the courts become aware through the expansion of automated interfaces and data exchanges.

Rule 1910.20. Support Order. Enforcement. General.
 (a)  A support order shall be enforced by income withholding as required by law in the manner provided by Rule 1910.21.

 (b)  Upon the obligor’s failure to comply with a support order, the order may also be enforced by any one or all of the following remedies:

   (1)  pursuant to Rule 1910.21, and without further hearing or prior notice to the obligor, increasing the amount of monthly support payments for payment of the overdue support at a rate to be determined by the court; withholding or seizing periodic or lump sum payments of income from a government agency, including unemployment compensation, social security, retirement or disability benefits and any other benefits; withholding or seizing periodic or lump sum payments of income from insurance carriers or privately-insured employers, including workers’ compensation benefits; withholding or seizing judgments or settlements; and withholding or seizing public and private retirement funds in pay status;

   (2)  pursuant to Rule 1910.22, imposing liens on real property;

   (3)  pursuant to Rule 1910.23, attaching and seizing assets of the obligor held in financial institutions;

   (4)  pursuant to Rule 1910.24, reducing and executing a judgment against the obligor;

   (5)  pursuant to Rules 1910.25 through 1910.25-6, initiating contempt proceedings;

   (6)  reporting the amount of overdue support to consumer reporting agencies in the manner prescribed by 23 Pa.C.S. §  4303;

   (7)  when the obligor owes overdue support in an amount of three months or more, suspending occupational, commercial/driver’s and recreational licenses in the manner prescribed by 23 Pa.C.S. §  4355.

 These remedies are cumulative and not alternative.

 (c)  For purposes of this Rule, overdue support remains subject to the remedies set forth in subdivision (b) of this Rule until paid in full. Except as provided in 23 Pa.C.S. §  4355 for suspension of licenses, neither a repayment schedule subsequently agreed to by the parties nor an order of court establishing such a schedule precludes the use of these remedies for collecting overdue support more quickly, whenever feasible.

   The provisions of this Rule 1910.20 amended November 7, 1988, effective January 1, 1989, 18 Pa.B. 5326; amended March 30, 1994, effective July 1, 1994, 24 Pa.B. 1943; amended May 31, 2000, effective July 1, 2000, 20 Pa.B. 3155. Immediately preceding text appears at serial page (256281).

Rule 1910.21. Support Order. Enforcement. Withholding of Income.
 (a)  Immediate Income Withholding. Every order of court shall contain an immediate order for the withholding of income unless (1) there is no overdue support owing under the order and (2) either the court finds there is good cause not to require immediate income withholding or the parties agree in writing to an alternative arrangement.

 (b)  Initiated Income Withholding. If there is no immediate income withholding pursuant to subdivision (a), and nonpayment of the support order causes overdue support to accrue, the court shall enter an order for the immediate withholding of income.

 (c)  Order for Withholding. An order for income withholding must include a provision directing that no commutation or compromise and release of worker’s compensation benefits, severance pay or any payment in lieu thereof shall be paid to the defendant until the order for withholding is dissolved by further order of court.

 (d)  Service on Employer.

   (1)  The order for income withholding shall be served upon the obligor’s employer. The employer shall pay to the State Collection and Disbursement Unit the full amount set forth in the order and may deduct from the balance due the obligor an amount authorized by law for clerical work and expense involved in complying with the order. Upon termination of the obligor’s employment, the employer shall notify the domestic relations section of the termination, the obligor’s last known address, and the name and address of the obligor’s new employer, if known.

   (2)  Upon willful failure to obey an order for income withholding, the employer, or an officer or employee of the employer, may be held in contempt and subject to other remedies provided by law.

   Offical Note

   23 Pa.C.S. §  4348(k)(1) provides that contempt is punishable by jail or fine. 23 Pa.C.S. §  4348(k)(2) provides that the employer is liable for any amount which the employer willfully fails to withhold or for any amount withheld but not forwarded to the domestic relations section. 23 Pa.C.S. §  4348(k)(3) provides that the court may attach funds or property of an employer.

 (e)  Notice to Obligor. Objections. A notice of entry of an order for income withholding shall be served on the obligor. The obligor may object to the order in writing or by personal appearance before the county domestic relations section within ten days after issuance of the notice. The grounds for an objection are limited to the following mistakes of fact: (i) no overdue support exists under the order or there is a mistake in the amount of overdue support; (ii) there is a mistake in the identity of the obligor; or (iii) the amount being withheld exceeds the maximum amount which may be withheld under the federal Consumer Credit Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. §  1673. If a mistake of fact has occurred, the order shall be modified accordingly.

 (f)  Income Withholding When the Obligor Defaults on Support Order.

   (1)  When an obligor is subject to an order for income withholding and payment is received from the employer within 15 days from the date upon which the obligor’s obligation would be considered overdue (i.e. the date upon which delinquent support is equal to one month’s support obligation), the payment shall be considered timely and any past due support shall not be converted to overdue support or subject to automated enforcement mechanisms.

   (2)  When nonpayment of the support order by the obligor causes overdue support to accrue, the court may increase the order for income withholding until the overdue support is paid in full. The court may also direct the employer to withhold any periodic or lump sum distributions of income which may be payable to the obligor in addition to regular income until further order of court.

 (g)  Priority of Income Withholding. If there are multiple support obligations in effect against the income of the obligor, the court shall allocate among the obligees the amount of income available for withholding, giving priority to current child support, child support-related expenses and child support arrears to the limit provided by law and stating the priority of payment to the obligee.

 (h)  Termination of Order for Income Withholding. An order for income withholding shall continue until dissolved by the court as provided by law.

   Official Note

   Pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S. §  4348(h), an order for income withholding may be terminated when (1) the support obligation has terminated and the total arrears are paid; (2) the payee cannot be located and it becomes impossible to forward payments; or (3) the result would be unconscionable. The order may also be terminated administratively by the domestic relations section.

Explanatory Comment—2008
   New subdivision 1910.21(f)(1) is intended to address circumstances in which an employer timely withholds income from an obligor pursuant to an income withholding order, but a delay occurs in receipt of the funds by the State Collection and Disbursement Unit. In those cases, it would be inappropriate to consider the obligor’s payment as untimely and convert past due support to overdue support because an obligor subject to an income withholding order has no control over the timing of the transmission of the funds from the employer. This new rule addreses solely timing issues by providing a 15-day grace period. It does not apply to obligors who are not subject to an order for income withholding.

Rule 1910.22. Support Order. Enforcement. Liens Against Real Property.
 (a)  An overdue support obligation of this or any other state which is on record at the domestic relations section shall constitute a lien of record by operation of law against the obligor’s real property located in Pennsylvania. When the overdue obligation arises in another state, it shall be transmitted to the Department of Public Welfare Central Registry. Upon receipt and verification of the amount owed, the Central Registry shall notify the appropriate domestic relations section which shall enter the amount owed in its records.

 (b)  A person seeking certification of a lien of record arising from overdue support owed by an obligor shall submit a written request for certification to the domestic relations section. The request must include the obligor’s full name, date of birth and social security number, if known. Within two business days, the domestic relations section shall provide written certification of the amount of overdue support owed as of the date of certification and shall enter the amount and date of certification on the docket.

   Official Note

   Rule 76 defines ‘‘person’’ as including a corporation, partnership and association as well as a natural person.

 (c)  The domestic relations section shall provide a copy of the written certification to the parties. Either party may object to the certification in writing or by personal appearance before the domestic relations section. The grounds for an objection are limited to the following: (1) no overdue support exists under the support order or there is a mistake in the certified amount of overdue support; (2) there is a mistake in the identity of the obligor; or (3) the lien cannot attach to the property as a matter of law. Pending a court’s disposition of the objection, the certification shall remain in full force and effect unless stayed by the court for good cause shown.

 (d)  Payment of the certified amount of overdue support shall constitute a satisfaction thereof and the domestic relations section shall record the amount of payment on the docket.

Service of the order on the financial institution shall attach the asset up to the amount of the overdue support until further order of court.

 (b)  The domestic relations section shall provide written notification of the attachment to the obligor. The obligor and any joint owner of the account who has been notified by the financial institution may object to the attachment in writing or by personal appearance before the domestic relations section within 30 days after issuance of the notice. The grounds for an objection are limited to the following: (1) no overdue support exists under the support order or there is a mistake in the certified amount of overdue support; (2) there is a mistake in the identity of the obligor; or (3) the account is not subject to attachment as a matter of law.

The order shall be served on the financial institution and a copy of the order provided to both parties.

Rule 1910.24. Support Order. Enforcement. Judgment for Arrearages. Petition to Correct Judgment. Execution.
 (a)  On and after the date it is due, overdue support shall constitute a judgment against the obligor as provided by law. The prothonotary shall enter the judgment of record upon the proper docket and in the judgment index either at the direction of the court or upon praecipe of a party or the domestic relations section. The judgment must be accompanied by a written certification showing that obligor owes overdue support pursuant to an order of court.

 (b)  A petition to correct the judgment shall be limited to the following grounds: (1) no overdue support exists under the support order or (2) there is a mistake in the amount of overdue support. The petition initially shall be determined before a conference officer or hearing officer in the same manner as an original proceeding for support. Except as provided by order of court, the filing of a petition to correct a judgment shall not stay the proceedings.

   Official Note

   It is important to note that the petition to strike or open a judgment used in civil practice is not adopted here.

 (c)  The judgment may be enforced against the obligor’s real or personal property as provided by Rules 3001 through 3011, governing transfer of judgments, and Rules 3101 through 3149, governing enforcement of judgments for the payment of money.

 (a)  Upon failure to comply with an order of support, a petition for civil contempt

   (1)  may be filed by the obligee at any time, or

   At the conference/hearing, the contempt petition may be dismissed, new and/or modified purge conditions may be imposed, or the judge may order you to jail. If the obligee fails to appear, the court will proceed with the case and enter an appropriate order.

   YOU ARE REQUIRED TO BRING:

   Your most recent pay stub for any and all employers

   Payroll address, phone number, fax number and contact person

The trier of fact shall issue an express finding that the respondent does or does not have the present ability to pay.

Explanatory Comment—2012
   The amendments to the form in subdivision (b) and new subdivision (f) are intended to assure compliance with the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Turner v. Rogers, 131 S. Ct. 2507 (2011). In that case, the Court held that counsel need not automatically be appointed for indigent support obligors facing incarceration in civil contempt proceedings. The Court held that the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution does not require that counsel be provided where the obligee is not represented by counsel and the state provides alternative procedural safeguards including adequate notice of the importance of the ability to pay, a fair opportunity to present, and to dispute, relevant information, and express court findings as to the obligor’s ability to pay.

   Official Note

   The time periods set forth in Rules 1910.25 through 1910.25-6 are for the benefit of the plaintiff, and not for the defendant. The goal is the prompt initiation of contempt proceedings because of the importance of ongoing support payments. The time periods in no way limit the right of either the domestic relations section or the plaintiff to proceed with a contempt action.

Rule 1910.25-7. Indirect Criminal Contempt. Incarceration.
 In addition to any other remedy available to the court, the court may order the respondent to obtain employment with income that can be verified and is subject to income attachment. If the respondent willfully fails to comply with an order to obtain such employment, the court may commit the respondent to jail upon adjudication for indirect criminal contempt, provided the respondent is afforded all of the procedural safeguards available to criminal defendants.

Explanatory Comment—2007
   Parental support of children is a fundamental requirement of law and public policy. Absent an inability to maintain employment or acquire other income or assets, sanction in the form of incarceration may be imposed by the court to compel compliance and provide an incentive to obey the law. The contempt process, which should be used as a last resort, is necessary to impose coercive sanctions upon those obligors whose circumstances provide no recourse to the court to compel payment or a good faith effort to comply. Appellate opinions have made it clear that an obligor who is in civil contempt cannot be incarcerated without the present ability to fulfill the conditions the court imposes for release. However, the courts also have noted that recalcitrant obligors may be imprisoned for indirect criminal contempt if afforded the proper procedural safeguards. See Godfrey v. Godfrey, 894 A.2d 776 (Pa. Super. 2006); Hyle v. Hyle, 868 A.2d 601 (Pa. Super. 2005).

Explanatory Comment—1994
   The support complaint and Income and Expense Statements contain a verification which states that the documents are subject to the penalties of the Crimes Code relating to unsworn falsification to authorities. A notary public is not needed.

Explanatory Comment—2006
   Rule 1910.27(c) is amended to separate income and expense information and to elicit the expense information relevant in cases that fall within the guidelines, as well as those that do not. In cases which can be determined under the guidelines, no expense information need be provided unless a party is claiming unusual needs and expenses that may warrant a deviation pursuant to Rule 1910.16-5 or an apportionment of expenses pursuant to Rule 1910.16-6. If a party is claiming such expenses, the form at subsection (c)(2)(A) should be submitted. A separate expense form for cases in which the parties’ combined monthly net income exceeds $20,000 is set forth at subsection (c)(2)(B).

   Rule 1910.11(c) was amended, effective in March 1995, to provide that only income and extraordinary expenses need be shown on the Income and Expense Statement in cases which can be determined pursuant to the guidelines. The Explanatory Comment—1994 explained the rationale for the amendment.

   Nevertheless, because space for both income and expense information was provided on the same form Income and Expense Statement, parties often needlessly expended time and effort to provide expense information that was not relevant at the conference. The amendments are intended to clarify and simplify the submission of expense information.

Explanatory Comment—2010
   When the combined net monthly income of the parties exceeds $30,000, the case will be decided pursuant to Rule 1910.16-3.1 and the Income Statement and the Expense Statement at Rule 1910.27(c)(2)(B) must be submitted.

Explanatory Comment—2012
   The form complaint for support in subdivision (a) has been amended to accommodate cases initiated pursuant to Rule 1910.3(a)(6). Because a support order may be entered against either party without regard to which party initiated the support action pursuant to Rule 1910.3(b), a party who believes that he or she may owe a duty of support may use the complaint form to initiate the action even if he or she ultimately is determined to be the obligor. In active charging support cases in which there is an overpayment in an amount in excess of two months of the monthly support obligation and the domestic relations section fails to reduce the charging order automatically to recoup the overpayment pursuant to Rule 1910.19(g)(1), the obligor may file a petition for recovery as set forth in subdivision (h) above. A separate form petition has been added in subdivision (i) by which a former support obligor may seek recovery of an overpayment in any amount in terminated cases pursuant to Rule 1910.19(g)(2).

   The provisions of this §  1910.28 amended March 23, 1987, effective July 1, 1987, 17 Pa.B. 1499; amended December 2, 1994, effective March 1, 1995, 25 Pa.B. 6263; amended May 31, 2000, effective July 1, 2000, 30 Pa.B. 3155; amended September 24, 2002, effective immediately, 32 Pa.B. 5044. Immediately preceding text appears at serial pages (290225) to (290226) and (267769).

Rule 1910.29. Evidence in Support Matters.
 (a)  Record Hearing. Except as provided in this rule, the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence shall be followed in all record hearings conducted in an action for support. A verified petition, affidavit or document, and any document incorporated by reference therein which would not be excluded under the hearsay rule if given in person shall be admitted into evidence if (1) at least 20 days’ written notice of the intention to offer them into evidence was given to the adverse party accompanied by a copy of each document to be offered; (2) the other party does not object to their admission into evidence; and (3) the evidence is offered under oath by the party or witness. An objection must be in writing and served on the proponent of the document within 10 days of the date of service of the notice of intention to offer the evidence. When an objection is properly made, the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence shall apply to determine the admissibility of the document into evidence.

 (b)  Medical Evidence.

   (1)  Non-Record Proceeding. In a non-record hearing, if a physician has determined that a medical condition affects a party’s ability to earn income and that party obtains a Physician Verification Form from the domestic relations section, has it completed by the party’s physician and submits it at the conference, it may be considered by the conference officer. If a party is receiving Social Security disability or workers’ compensation benefits, the party shall submit copies of the disability or workers’ compensation determination in lieu of the Physician Verification Form.

   (2)  Record Proceeding. If the matter proceeds to a record hearing and the party wishes to introduce the completed Physician Verification Form into evidence, he or she must serve the form on the other party not later than 20 days after the conference. The other party may file and serve an objection to the introduction of the form within 10 days of the date of service. If an objection is made and the physician testifies, the trier of fact shall have the discretion to allocate the costs of the physician’s testimony between the parties. If there is no objection, the form may be admitted into evidence without the testimony of the physician. In the event that the record hearing is held sooner than 30 days after the conference, the trier of fact may provide appropriate relief, such as granting a continuance to the objecting party.

   (3)  The Physician Verification Form shall be substantially in the following form:

Explanatory Comment—2000
   23 Pa.C.S. §  4342(f) creates a hearsay exception in support actions to permit a verified petition, affidavit or document and a document incorporated by reference in any of them to be admitted into evidence if it would not otherwise be excluded as hearsay if given in person and it is admitted under oath by a party or witness to the support action. Rule 1910.29 requires that notice of the documents to be admitted be given to the other party prior to the hearing. It also sets forth the procedures for raising an objection to the admission of those documents.

   If the requisite 20-day notice is given and there is no objection, the document must be admitted into evidence under this rule and 23 Pa.C.S. §  4342(f). In the event an objection is timely made, the rules of evidence apply to determine the document’s ultimate admissibility.

   Rule 1910.29 is not intended to affect 23 Pa.C.S. §  4342(g) and (h) relating to admissibility of payment records, billing statements and bills for genetic testing and prenatal and postnatal health care of the mother and child. Those documents are admissible into evidence without advance notice for the limited purposes which are expressly set forth in those statutory provisions.

   (2)  Section 4 of Act 1996-20, 23 Pa.C.S. §  4342, insofar as it provides that long arm jurisdiction shall be used in preference to proceedings under Part VIII-A relating to intrastate family support actions;

   The provisions of these Rules 1915.1—1915.25 adopted December 10, 1981, effective July 1, 1982, 12 Pa.B. 867; by order of June 25, 1982 and November 8, 1982, the effective date was extended to January 1, 1983, 12 Pa.B. 2169 and 12 Pa.B. 4040, unless otherwise noted.

Rule 1915.1. Scope. Definitions.
 (a)  These rules govern the practice and procedure in all actions for legal and physical custody of minor children, including habeas corpus proceedings and claims for custody asserted in an action of divorce.

   Official Note

   The term custody includes shared legal custody, sole legal custody, partial physical custody, primary physical custody, shared physical custody, sole physical custody and supervised physical custody. See 23 Pa.C.S. §  5322(a). Rule 1920.32(a) provides that when a claim for custody is joined with the action of divorce, the practice and procedure governing the claim for custody shall be in accordance with these rules.

 (b)  As used in this chapter, unless the context of a rule indicates otherwise, the following terms shall have the following meanings:

   ‘‘action,’’ all proceedings for legal and physical custody and proceedings for modification of prior orders of any court;

   ‘‘child,’’ an unemancipated individual under 18 years of age;

   ‘‘conference officer,’’ an individual who presides over an office conference pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.4-2(a) or the initial non-record proceeding under Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.4-3(a). For purposes of these rules, a conciliator is synonymous with a conference officer;

   ‘‘custody,’’ the legal right to keep, control, guard, care for, and preserve a child and includes the terms ‘‘legal custody,’’ ‘‘physical custody,’’ and ‘‘shared custody;’’

   ‘‘hearing officer,’’ a lawyer who conducts a record hearing on partial custody cases pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.4-2(b);

   ‘‘home county,’’ the county in which the child lived with either or both parents, a person acting as a parent, or in an institution for at least six consecutive months immediately preceding the filing of the action, and in the case of a child less than six months old, the county in which the child lived from birth with any of the persons mentioned. A period of temporary absence of the child from the physical custody of the parent, institution, or person acting as parent shall not affect the six-month or other period;

   ‘‘in loco parentis,’’ a person who puts himself or herself in the situation of a lawful parent by assuming the obligations incident to the parental relationship without going through the formality of a legal adoption. The status of in loco parentis embodies two ideas: (1) the assumption of a parental status; and (2) the discharge of parental duties;

   Official Note

   See A.S. v. I.S., 130 A.3d 763, 766 n.3 (Pa. 2015).

   ‘‘legal custody,’’ the right to make major decisions on behalf of the child, including, but not limited to, medical, religious, and educational decisions;

   ‘‘mediator,’’ an individual qualified under Pa.R.C.P. No. 1940.4 and who assists custody litigants independently from the procedures set forth in Pa.R.C.P. Nos. 1915.1—1915.25 by engaging the litigants in the alternative dispute principles in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1940.2 to resolve custody matters in whole or in part;

   ‘‘mediation,’’ the confidential process by which a neutral mediator assists the parties in attempting to reach a mutually acceptable agreement on issues arising in a custody action. Mediation is not a court proceeding; rather, it is an independent, non-record proceeding in lieu of court involvement for the purpose of assisting the parties to address the child’s best interest. An agreement reached by the parties must be based on the voluntary decisions of the parties and not the decision of the mediator. The agreement may resolve all or only some of the disputed issues. The parties are required to mediate in good faith, but are not compelled to reach an agreement. While mediation is an alternative means of conflict resolution, it is not a substitute for the benefit of legal advice. The participants in mediation shall be limited to the parties to the custody action, primarily the child’s parents and persons acting as parents. Except as provided in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1940.5(c), non-parties, including children, grandparents, and the parties’ attorneys, shall not participate in the mediation.

   ‘‘non-record proceeding,’’ the initial office conference set forth in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.4-3. Mediation, as outlined in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1940.1—1940.9, shall not be construed as a non-record proceeding;

   ‘‘partial physical custody,’’ the right to assume physical custody of the child for less than a majority of the time;

   ‘‘person acting as a parent,’’ a person other than a parent, including an institution, who has physical custody of a child and who has either been awarded custody by a court or claims a right to custody. See also the definition of in loco parentis;

   ‘‘physical custody,’’ the actual physical possession and control of a child;

   ‘‘primary physical custody,’’ the right to assume physical custody of the child for the majority of time;

   ‘‘relocation,’’ a change in a residence of the child that significantly impairs the ability of a non-relocating party to exercise custodial rights;

   ‘‘shared legal custody,’’ the right of more than one individual to legal custody of the child;

   ‘‘shared physical custody,’’ the right of more than one individual to assume physical custody of the child, each having significant periods of physical custodial time with the child;

   ‘‘sole legal custody,’’ the right of one individual to exclusive legal custody of the child;

   ‘‘sole physical custody,’’ the right of one individual to exclusive physical custody of the child; and

   ‘‘supervised physical custody,’’ custodial time during which an agency or an adult designated by the court or agreed upon by the parties monitors the interaction between the child and the individual with those rights.

   Official Note

   The term ‘‘supervised visitation’’ in the prior statute has been replaced by the term ‘‘supervised physical custody.’’

   Official Note

   The definitions of the terms of the various forms of legal custody and physical custody are taken from 23 Pa.C.S. §  5322(a).

   For additional definitions, see the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, 23 Pa.C.S. §  5402.

   The provisions of this Rule 1915.1 amended November 8, 1982, effective January 1, 1983, 12 Pa.B. 4040; amended November 7, 1988, effective January 1, 1989, 18 Pa.B. 5323; amended March 30, 1994, effective July 1, 1994, 24 Pa.B. 1943; amended November 19, 2008, effective immediately, 38 Pa.B. 6595; amended August 1, 2013, effective September 3, 2013, 43 Pa.B. 4702; amended February 8, 2018, effective April 1, 2018, 48 Pa.B. 1095. Immediately preceding text appears at serial pages (381079) to (381080) and (390109).

Rule 1915.2. Venue.
 (a)  An action may be brought in any county

   (1)  (i) which is the home county of the child at the time of commencement of the proceeding, or

     (ii)   which had been the child’s home county within six months before commencement of the proceeding and the child is absent from the county but a parent or person acting as parent continues to live in the county; or

   (2)  when the court of another county does not have venue under subdivision (1), and the child and the child’s parents, or the child and at least one parent or a person acting as a parent, have a significant connection with the county other than mere physical presence and there is available within the county substantial evidence concerning the child’s protection, training and personal relationships; or

   (3)  when all counties in which venue is proper pursuant to subdivisions (1) and (2) have found that the court before which the action is pending is the more appropriate forum to determine the custody of the child; or

   (4)  when it appears that venue would not be proper in any other county under prerequisites substantially in accordance with paragraph (1), (2) or (3); or

   (5)  when the child is present in the county and has been abandoned or it is necessary in an emergency to protect the child because the child or a sibling or parent of the child is subjected to or threatened with mistreatment or abuse.

 (b)  Physical presence of the child or a party, while desirable, is not necessary or sufficient to make a child custody determination except as provided in subdivision (a)(5) above.

 (c)  The court at any time may transfer an action to the appropriate court of any other county where the action could originally have been brought or could be brought if it determines that it is an inconvenient forum under the circumstances and the court of another county is the more appropriate forum. It shall be the duty of the prothonotary of the court in which the action is pending to forward to the prothonotary of the county to which the action is transferred certified copies of the docket entries, process, pleadings and other papers filed in the action. The costs and fees of the petition for transfer and the removal of the record shall be paid by the petitioner in the first instance to be taxable as costs in the case.

   Official Note

   Under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, 23 Pa.C.S.A. §  5401 et seq., the court may decline to exercise its jurisdiction in a particular action despite the action having been brought in a county of proper venue. Section 5426 of the act, relating to simultaneous proceedings in other courts, provides for the mandatory refusal by the court to exercise its jurisdiction in an action. Section 5427 of the act, relating to inconvenient forum, and §  5428 of the act, relating to jurisdiction declined by reason of conduct, provide for the discretionary refusal by the court to exercise its jurisdiction.

Explanatory Comment—2008
   Subdivision (a) of Rule 1915.2 incorporates the categories of jurisdiction for initial custody determinations and temporary emergency proceedings in the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act at 23 Pa.C.S.A. § §  5421 and 5424 as the venue provisions for these rules, restating them in rule form without change in substance. Subdivision (a) follows the policy of §  5471 of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, which provides that the provisions of the act ‘‘allocating jurisdiction and functions between and among courts of different states shall also allocate jurisdiction and functions between and among courts of common pleas of this Commonwealth.’’

   Subdivision (b), relating to the effect of the physical presence of the child or a party within a county, follows §  5421(c) without substantial change.

   Subdivision (c) follows the inconvenient forum provisions of 23 Pa.C.S.A. §  5427.

   (2)  A grandparent seeking physical or legal custody of a grandchild, who is not in loco parentis to the child, shall plead facts establishing standing under 23 Pa.C.S. §  5324(3) in Paragraph 9(b) of the complaint in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.15(a).

Comment—2020
   Act of May 4, 2018, P.L. 112, No. 21, amended 23 Pa.C.S. §  5324 by adding a new class of third-party standing for individuals seeking custody of a child whose parents do not have care and control of the child. The individual seeking custody may or may not be related to the child. Subject to Section 5324(5), the newly added standing provision requires that: (1) the individual has assumed or is willing to assume responsibility for the child; (2) the individual has a sustained, substantial, and sincere interest in the child’s welfare; and (3) the child’s parents do not have care and control of the child. A plaintiff proceeding under Section 5324(4) shall satisfy the requirements of that provision by clear and convincing evidence. Additionally, if a juvenile dependency proceeding has been initiated, or is ongoing, or there is an order for permanent legal custody, Section 5324(5) provides that an individual cannot assert standing under Section 5324(4).

   Consistent with the Act 21 of 2018 statutory changes, subdivision (e) has been revised to include a third party seeking custody of a child under 23 Pa.C.S. §  5324(4). The subdivision has been reorganized to sequentially follow the statutory provisions in 23 Pa.C.S. § §  5324(2)—(4) and 5325. Similarly, the Complaint for Custody Paragraph 9 in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.15(a) has been reorganized to sequentially follow the statutory provisions and rules sequence, as well. See Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.15(a).

     (ii)   The updated Criminal Record/Abuse History Verification form shall be filed with the prothonotary within 14 days of any change in circumstances, or five days prior to any court proceeding, whichever occurs first.

   (5)  Sanctions. A party’s failure to file an initial or updated Criminal Record/Abuse History Verification form may result in sanctions against that party.

     (i)   In determining whether a party or household member poses a threat to the child or requires an additional evaluation or counseling, as provided in 23 Pa.C.S. §  5329(c)—(e), the judge, conference officer, conciliator, or other appointed individual shall consider:

Comment:
   There is no obligation for the court to conduct an independent investigation of the criminal record or abuse history of a party or the party’s household member.

   The intent of subdivision (a)(4) is for the parties to have the most current information available, including after a final order—provided the child remains under the court’s jurisdiction.

   As used in subdivision (a), a ‘‘child custody action’’ is intended to include any action where custody is sought to be awarded, including a protection from abuse action. An Criminal Record/Abuse History Verification form is not required in a protection from abuse action if custody is not sought.

   See 23 Pa.C.S. §  5322 (defining ‘‘household member’’).

   For subdivision (c)(6), see Pa.R.Civ.P. 1930.5 (discovery in domestic relations matters) and Pa.R.E. 614 (court’s calling or examining a witness).

   Given the sensitive nature of the record, see Pa.R.Civ.P. 1930.1 (form of caption and applicability of the Case Records Public Access Policy of the Unified Judicial System of Pennsylvania).

Rule 1915.3-3. Report of Child Abuse and Protective Services.
 (a)  General Rule. A court shall determine whether a participant in a child custody action has a history of child abuse or involvement with protective services.

 (b)  Definitions. The following definitions shall apply to this rule:

   (1)  ‘‘Participant’’ shall include any party, child, or member of a party’s household identified on the Criminal Record or Abuse History Verification, as required by Pa.R.Civ.P. 1915.3-2.

   (2)  ‘‘County agency’’ shall have the same meaning as set forth in Pa.R.J.C.P. 1120 (defining ‘‘county agency’’).

   (3)  ‘‘Form’’ shall be the form found at Pa.R.Civ.P. 1915.3-4.

 (c)  Submission. Whenever a party has disclosed a history of child abuse or involvement with protective services pursuant to Pa.R.Civ.P. 1915.3-2, or the court or its designee believes that further inquiry is warranted, the court shall confirm or identify all participants on the form in Pa.R.Civ.P. 1915.3-4 and transmit the form for completion to the county agency with notice to the parties.

 (d)  Return. The county agency shall complete the form for all participants and return it to the court no later than 14 days or the time specified by the court after receiving the submission.

 (e)  Dissemination. Upon receipt of the completed form, the court shall promptly docket and disseminate it to the parties.

 (f)  Confidentiality. The completed form shall be confidential and not publicly accessible. Further dissemination by the recipients of the form is in violation of 23 Pa.C.S. Ch. 63 (Child Protective Services Law).

 (g)  Witnesses. The parties may subpoena with leave of court, or the court may otherwise order, the county agency to provide a witness or witnesses to attend and testify about any child abuse history or protective services disclosed on the form.

Comment:
   This rule is intended to implement 23 Pa.C.S. §  5329.1.

   As used in subdivision (a), a ‘‘child custody action’’ is intended to include any action where custody may be awarded, including a protection from abuse action.

   For subdivision (c), the court may use Part I (Participant) of each party’s Criminal Record or Abuse History Verification (‘‘Verification’’), as provided in Rule 1915.3-2, in lieu of completing the ‘‘participant’’ section of the form. The court shall indicate the request for information by checking the box at the top of the first page of the Verification.

   For subdivision (g), see Pa.R.Civ.P. 1930.5 (discovery in domestic relations matters) and Pa.R.E. 614 (court’s calling or examining a witness).

   Given the sensitive nature of the record, see Pa.R.Civ.P. 1930.1 (form of caption and applicability of the Case Records Public Access Policy of the Unified Judicial System of Pennsylvania).

   Rule 1915.25(c) suspends 23 Pa.C.S. §  6339, insofar as it is inconsistent with this rule.

Rule 1915.4. Prompt Disposition of Custody Cases.
 (a)  Initial Contact With the Court. Depending upon the procedure in the judicial district, the parties’ initial in-person contact with the court (including, but not limited to a conference with a conference officer pursuant to Rule 1915.4-2, a conference with a judge, conciliation, mediation and/or class/seminar) shall be scheduled to occur not later than 45 days from the filing of a complaint or petition.

 (b)  Listing Trials Before the Court. Depending upon the procedure in the judicial district, within 180 days of the filing of the complaint either the court shall automatically enter an order scheduling a trial before a judge or a party shall file a praecipe, motion or request for trial, except as otherwise provided in this subdivision. If it is not the practice of the court to automatically schedule trials and neither party files a praecipe, motion or request for trial within 180 days of filing of the pleading, the court shall, sua sponte or on motion of a party, dismiss the matter unless a party has been granted an extension for good cause shown, or the court finds that dismissal is not in the best interests of the child. The extension shall not exceed 60 days beyond the 180 day limit. A further reasonable extension may be granted by the court upon agreement of the parties or when the court finds, on the record, compelling circumstances for a further reasonable extension. If an extension is granted and, thereafter, neither party files a praecipe, motion or request for trial within the time period allowed by the extension, the court shall, sua sponte or on the motion of a party, dismiss the matter unless the court finds that dismissal is not in the best interests of the child. A motion to dismiss, pursuant to this rule, shall be filed and served upon the opposing party. The opposing party shall have 20 days from the date of service to file an objection. If no objection is filed, the court shall dismiss the case. Prior to a sua sponte dismissal, the court shall notify the parties of an intent to dismiss the case unless an objection is filed within 20 days of the date of the notice.

 (c)  Trial. Trials before a judge shall commence within 90 days of the date the scheduling order is entered. Trials and hearings shall be scheduled to be heard on consecutive days whenever possible but, if not on consecutive days, then the trial or hearing shall be concluded not later than 45 days from commencement.

 (d)  Prompt Decisions. The judge’s decision shall be entered and filed within 15 days of the date upon which the trial is concluded unless, within that time, the court extends the date for such decision by order entered of record showing good cause for the extension. In no event shall an extension delay the entry of the court’s decision more than 45 days after the conclusion of trial.

 (e)  Emergency or Special Relief. Nothing in this rule shall preclude a party from seeking, nor a court from ordering, emergency or interim special relief at any time after the commencement of the action.

Explanatory Comment—2000
   A new rule requiring prompt custody trials was recommended by a special committee established by the Pennsylvania Superior Court. That committee concluded that the interests of children who are the subjects of custody litigation would best be served by a requirement that the litigation be concluded within specific time frames.

Rule 1915.4-1. Alternative Hearing Procedures for Partial Custody Actions.
 (a)  A custody action shall proceed as prescribed by Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.4-3 unless the court, by local rule, adopts the alternative hearing procedure authorized by Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.4-2 pursuant to which an action for partial custody may be heard by a hearing officer, except as provided in subdivision (b).

 (b)  Promptly after the parties’ initial contact with the court as set forth in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.4(a), a party may move the court for a hearing before a judge, rather than a hearing officer, in an action for partial custody where:

   (1)  there are complex questions of law, fact or both; or

   (2)  the parties certify to the court that there are serious allegations affecting the child’s welfare.

 (c)  The president judge or the administrative judge of the family division of each county shall certify that custody proceedings generally are conducted in accordance with either Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.4-2 or Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.4-3. The certification shall be filed with the Domestic Relations Procedural Rules Committee of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and shall be substantially in the following form:

 I hereby certify that

County conducts its custody proceedings in accordance with Pa.R.C.P. No.
.

Explanatory Comment
   These rules provide an optional procedure for using hearing officers in partial custody cases. The procedure is similar to the one provided for support cases in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.12: a conference, record hearing before a hearing officer and argument on exceptions before a judge. The terms ‘‘conference officer’’ and ‘‘hearing officer’’ have the same meaning here as in the support rules.

   It is important to note that use of the procedure prescribed in Pa.R.C.P. Nos. 1915.4-1 and 1915.4-2 is optional rather than mandatory. Counties which prefer to have all partial custody cases heard by a judge may continue to do so.

   These procedures are not intended to replace or prohibit the use of any form of mediation or conciliation. On the contrary, they are intended to be used in cases which are not resolved through the use of less adversarial means.

   The intent of the 2007 amendments to Pa.R.C.P. Nos. 1915.4-1 and 1915.4-2, and Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915-4.3, was to clarify the procedures in record and non-record custody proceedings. When the first proceeding is non-record, no exceptions are required and a request for a de novo hearing may be made.

   In lieu of continuing the practice of including in the Note a 67-county list identifying the hearing procedure selected by the local county court, the list can now be found on the Domestic Relations Procedural Rules Committee website.

Immediately preceding text appears at serial pages (380178) to (380180).

Rule 1915.4-2. Partial Custody. Office Conference. Hearing. Record. Exceptions. Order.
 (a)  Office Conference.

   (1)  The office conference shall be conducted by a conference officer.

   (2)  If the respondent fails to appear at the conference before the conference officer as directed by the court, the conference may proceed without the respondent.

   (3)  The conference officer may make a recommendation to the parties relating to partial custody or supervised physical custody of the child or children. If an agreement for partial custody or supervised physical custody is reached at the conference, the conference officer shall prepare a written order in conformity with the agreement for signature by the parties and submission to the court together with the officer’s recommendation for approval or disapproval. The court may enter an order in accordance with the agreement without hearing the parties.

   (4)  At the conclusion of the conference, if an agreement relating to partial custody or supervised physical custody has not been reached, the parties shall be given notice of the date, time and place of a hearing before a hearing officer, which may be the same day, but in no event shall be more than forty-five days from the date of the conference.

 (b)  Hearing.

   (1)  The hearing shall be conducted by a hearing officer who must be a lawyer, and a record shall be made of the testimony. A hearing officer who is a lawyer employed by, or under contract with, a judicial district or appointed by the court shall not practice family law before a conference officer, hearing officer, or judge of the same judicial district.

   (2)  The hearing officer shall receive evidence and hear argument. The hearing officer may recommend to the court that the parties and/or the subject child or children submit to examination and evaluation by experts pursuant to Rule 1915.8.

   (3)  Within ten days of the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall file with the court and serve upon all parties a report containing a recommendation with respect to the entry of an order of partial custody or supervised physical custody. The report may be in narrative form stating the reasons for the recommendation and shall include a proposed order, including a specific schedule for partial custody or supervised physical custody.

   (4)  Within twenty days after the date the hearing officer’s report is mailed or received by the parties, whichever occurs first, any party may file exceptions to the report or any part thereof, to rulings on objections to evidence, to statements or findings of fact, to conclusions of law, or to any other matters occurring during the hearing. Each exception shall set forth a separate objection precisely and without discussion. Matters not covered by exceptions are deemed waived unless, prior to entry of the final order, leave is granted to file exceptions raising those matters. If exceptions are filed, any other party may file exceptions within twenty days of the date of service of the original exceptions.

   (5)  If no exceptions are filed within the twenty-day period, the court shall review the report and, if approved, enter a final order.

   (6)  If exceptions are filed, the court shall hear argument on the exceptions within forty-five days of the date the last party files exceptions, and enter an appropriate final order within fifteen days of argument. No motion for Post-Trial Relief may be filed to the final order.

Explanatory Comment—2006
   The time for filing exceptions has been expanded from ten to twenty days. The purpose of this amendment is to provide ample opportunity for litigants and counsel to receive notice of the entry of the order, to assure commonwealth-wide consistency in calculation of time for filing and to conform to applicable general civil procedural rules.

Rule 1915.4-3. Non-Record Proceedings. Trials.
 (a)  Non-Record Proceedings. In judicial districts utilizing an initial non-record proceeding, i.e., office conference, if an agreement is not finalized by the conclusion of the proceeding, the conference officer shall promptly notify the court that the matter should be listed for trial. A lawyer employed by, or under contract with, a judicial district or appointed by the court to serve as a conference officer to preside over a non-record proceeding shall not practice family law before a conference officer, hearing officer, or judge of the same judicial district.

 (b) Trial. The trial before the court shall be de novo. The court shall hear the case and render a decision within the time periods set forth in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.4.

Explanatory Comment—2018
   The amendment to this rule, in conjunction with the amendment to Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.1, standardizes terminology used in the custody process and identifies court personnel by title and in some cases qualifications. Of note, the term ‘‘mediator,’’ which had been included in the rule, has been omitted and is specifically defined in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.1.

   As in the support rules, custody conference officers preside over conferences and hearing officers preside over hearings. Regardless of the individual’s title, presiding over a conference or a hearing triggers the family law attorney practice preclusion in this rule and in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.4-2(b) in the case of a hearing officer. Mediators, as defined in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.1 and as qualified in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1940.4, do not preside over custody conferences or hearings; rather, mediators engage custody litigants in alternative dispute resolution methods pursuant to Chapter 1940 of the Rules of Civil Procedure and, as such, the preclusion from practicing family law in the same judicial district in which an attorney/mediator is appointed is inapplicable.

Rule 1915.4-4. Pre-Trial Procedures.
 (a)  Pre-Trial Conference.

   (1)  The court shall schedule a pre-trial conference before a judge in an initial custody or modification proceeding at the request of a party or by the court sua sponte.

   (2)  The pre-trial conference scheduling procedure shall be as follows:

     (i)   If a party wishes to request a pre-trial conference, the party shall file a praecipe set forth in subdivision (h).

     (ii)   A party may file the praecipe any time after a custody conciliation or conference unless a pre-trial conference has already been scheduled or held.

     (iii)   The scheduling of a pre-trial conference shall not stay a previously scheduled proceeding unless otherwise ordered by the court.

     (iv)   The pretrial conference may be scheduled at any time, but shall be scheduled at least 30 days prior to trial.

 (b)  Pre-Trial Statement.

   (1)  Not later than five days prior to the pre-trial conference, each party shall file a pre-trial statement with the prothonotary and serve a copy upon the court and the other party or the party’s counsel.

   (2)  The pre-trial statement shall include, together with any additional information required by special order of the court, the following matters:

     (i)   the name and address of each expert whom the party intends to call as a witness at trial;

     (ii)   the name and address of each person the party intends to call as a witness at trial and the relationship of that witness to the party. Inclusion of a witness on the pre-trial statement constitutes an affirmation that the party’s counsel or the self-represented party has communicated with the witness about the substance of the witness’s testimony prior to the filing of the pre-trial statement; and

     (iii)   a proposed order setting forth the custody schedule requested by the party.

 (c)  Exhibits. In addition to subdivision (b)(2), the party shall include any proposed exhibits to be introduced at trial, including the expert’s report, as part of the pre-trial statement served upon the other party or other party’s counsel, but the proposed exhibits shall not be included with the pre-trial statement served upon the court.

 (d)  Sanctions. If a party fails to file a pre-trial statement or otherwise comply with the requirements of subdivisions (b) and (c), the court may sanction the party as provided in Pa.R.Civ.P. 4019(c)(2) and (c)(4).

 (e)  Amendments. Unless the court orders otherwise, the parties may amend a pretrial statement at any time, but not less than seven days before trial.

 (f)  Topics. The court shall consider the following topics at the pre-trial conference:

   (1)  issues for resolution by the court;

   (2)  unresolved discovery matters;

   (3)  agreements of the parties;

   (4)  issues relating to expert witnesses;

   (5)  settlement or mediation of the case;

   (6)  a party’s or household member’s criminal record or abuse history or a party’s, household member’s, or child’s involvement with the juvenile dependency court or the children and youth social service agency as outlined in 23 Pa.C.S. § §  5329 and 5329.1, including the admissibility of related documents, other evidentiary issues, or testimony;

   (7)  such other matters that may aid in the disposition of the case; and

   (8)  if a trial date has not been scheduled, the court shall schedule the trial at the pre-trial conference.

 (g)  Order. The court shall enter an order following the pre-trial conference detailing the parties’ agreements as to any of the matters considered, limiting the trial to unresolved issues, and setting forth the schedule for further action in the case. The order shall control the subsequent course of the action unless modified at trial to prevent manifest injustice.

 (h)  Form. The praecipe for pre-trial conference required by this rule shall be substantially in the following form:


PRAECIPE FOR PRE-TRIAL CONFERENCE
 

   To the Prothonotary:

   Please schedule a pre-trial conference in the above-captioned custody matter pursuant to Pa.R.Civ.P. 1915.4-4.

Historical Commentary
   The following commentary related to Pa.R.Civ.P. 1915.4-4 is historical in nature and represents statements of the Committee at the time of rulemaking:

Explanatory Comment
   In 2013, the Domestic Relations Procedural Rules Committee (the ‘‘Committee’’) recognized there was a wide disparity in pre-trial procedures in custody cases among the various judicial districts. By adopting this rule, the Supreme Court established uniform state-wide pre-trial procedures in custody cases. With an eye toward reducing custody litigation, the rule encourages early preparation and court involvement for purposes of expedited resolutions. The rule was based upon the pretrial procedures in divorce cases as set forth in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1920.33(b). The rule does not affect, however, the First Judicial District’s practice of conducting a pre-trial conference upon the filing of a motion for a protracted or semi-protracted trial.

   In 2015, the Committee expressed concern the rule as previously adopted by the Supreme Court allowed for an interpretation contrary to the intent of the rule. The Committee proposed and the Court adopted an amendment to the rule to clarify the rule’s mandate as it relates to witnesses. As a goal of any pre-trial conference is to settle the case, in whole or in part, the Committee believed a best practice in reaching that goal is having a thorough knowledge of the case, including the substance of anticipated witness testimony. As amended, the rule plainly states that counsel or a self-represented party is required to discuss with the witness their testimony prior to including the witness on the pre-trial statement.

   Unlike Pa.R.C.P. No. 1920.33(b), the rule does not require inclusion of a summary of the witness’s testimony in the pre-trial statement; but rather, an affirmation by counsel or self-represented party that there was actual communication with each witness about the witness’s testimony. With the additional information from witnesses, counsel, self-represented parties, and the trial court can better engage in more fruitful settlement discussions at the pre-trial conference.

Rule 1915.5. Question of Jurisdiction, Venue, or Standing. Counterclaim Discovery. No Responsive Pleading by Defendant Required.
 (a)  Question of Jurisdiction, Venue, or Standing.

   (1)  A party shall raise jurisdiction of the person or venue by preliminary objection.

   (2)  A party may raise standing by preliminary objection or at a custody hearing or trial.

   (3)  The court may raise standing sua sponte.

   (4)  In a third-party plaintiff custody action in which standing has not been resolved by preliminary objection, the court shall address the third-party plaintiff’s standing and include its standing decision in a written opinion or order.

   Official Note

   The court may raise at any time a question of (1) jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action or (2) the exercise of its jurisdiction pursuant to Section 5426 of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, relating to simultaneous proceedings in other courts, Section 5427, relating to inconvenient forum, and Section 5428, relating to jurisdiction declined by reason of conduct. The Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, 23 Pa.C.S. §  5407, provides that, upon request of a party, an action in which a question of the existence or exercise of jurisdiction is raised shall be given calendar priority and handled expeditiously.

 (b)  A party may file a counterclaim asserting the right of physical or legal custody within 20 days of service of the complaint upon that party or at the time of hearing, whichever first occurs. The claim shall be in the same form as a complaint as required by Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.3.

 (c)  There shall be no discovery unless authorized by special order of court.

   Official Note

   The rule relating to discovery in domestic relations matters generally is Pa.R.C.P. No. 1930.5.

 (d)  Except as set forth in subdivisions (a) and (b), a responsive pleading shall not be required. If a party files a responsive pleading, it shall not delay a hearing or trial.

Explanatory Comment—1994
   Under subdivision (a), the defendant may but is not required to plead to the complaint. All averments may be disputed by the defendant at the custody hearing. An attorney who wished to file another pleading may do so. However, the action is not to be delayed to permit its filing.

Comment—2020
   Act of May 4, 2018, P.L. 112, No. 21, amended 23 Pa.C.S. §  5324 by adding a new class of third-party standing for individuals seeking custody of a child whose parents do not have care and control of the child. Subject to the limitations in 23 Pa.C.S. §  5324(5), the newly added standing provision requires that: (1) the individual has assumed or is willing to assume responsibility for the child; (2) the individual has a sustained, substantial, and sincere interest in the child’s welfare; and (3) the child’s parents do not have care and control of the child. A plaintiff proceeding under Section 5324(4) shall satisfy the requirements of that provision by clear and convincing evidence.

   Typically, when a third party is seeking custody of a child, the child’s parents can raise the issue of the third party’s standing to pursue custody. However, Section 5324(4) permits a party to seek custody of a child only when the child’s parents do not have care and control of the child. If the parents’ lack of care and control also results in their non-participation in the custody litigation, the third party’s standing may go unchallenged. Subdivision (a) has been amended by including two new subdivisions to address this circumstance. Subdivision (a)(3) permits the court to raise standing sua sponte and, if third-party standing is not resolved by preliminary objection, the court shall address the standing issue in its written opinion or order as required by subdivision (a)(4).

Rule 1915.6. Joinder of Parties.
 (a)(1)  If the court learns from the pleadings or any other source that a parent whose parental rights have not been previously terminated or a person who has physical custody of the child is not a party to the action, it shall order that the person be joined as a party. Such person shall be served with a copy of all prior pleadings and notice of the joinder substantially in the form prescribed by Rule 1915.16(a).

   (2)  The person joined must file any objection to the order of joinder within twenty days after notice of the order.

   (3)  The person joined may file a counterclaim asserting a right to physical or legal custody in the form required for a complaint by Rule 1915.3. A copy of the counterclaim shall be served upon all other parties to the action as provided by Rule 440.

 (b)  If the court learns from the pleadings or any other source that any other person who claims to have custodial rights with respect to the child is not a party to the action, it shall order that notice be given to that person of the pendency of the action and of the right to intervene therein. The notice shall be substantially in the form prescribed by Rule 1915.16(b).

Explanatory Comment—1994
   The position taken by the rules is that a person in physical custody of the child and a parent whose parental rights have not been terminated are necessary parties to a custody determination. While it may be desirable to have other persons who claim custody rights as parties to the action, their joinder is not a prerequisite to a custody determination.

 (b)  the parties may state the agreement on the record, provided that:

   The rule has been amended to ensure that when a custody agreement is orally placed on the record that a written custody order prepared by the parties memorializing the parties’ agreement is timely submitted to the court or the court memorializes the oral agreement into a written custody order. The amendment avoids the untenable circumstance that the only written record of the parties’ oral agreement is a transcription of what had been placed on the record. Transcription agreements are often cumbersome and difficult to discern as to the custody terms and provisions, which makes enforcement difficult. This amendment is consistent with the holding in R.L.P. v. R.F.M., 110 A.3d 201 (Pa. Super. 2015).

Rule 1915.8. Physical and Mental Examination of Persons.
 (a)  The court may order the child(ren) and/or any party to submit to and fully participate in an evaluation by an appropriate expert or experts. The order, which shall be substantially in the form set forth in Rule 1915.18, may be made upon the court’s own motion, upon the motion of a party with reasonable notice to the person to be examined, or by agreement of the parties. The order shall specify the place, manner, conditions and scope of the examination and the person or persons by whom it shall be made and to whom distributed. In entering an order directing an evaluation pursuant to this rule, the court shall consider all appropriate factors including the following, if applicable:

   (1)  the allocation of the costs, including insurance coverage, if any, attendant to the undertaking of the evaluation and preparation of the resultant report and court testimony of any appointed expert;

   (2)  the execution of appropriate authorizations and/or consents to facilitate the examination;

   (3)  any deadlines imposed regarding the completion of the examination and payment of costs;

   (4)  the production of any report and of underlying data to counsel and/or any unrepresented party upon the completion of the examination; and

   (5)  any additional safeguards that are deemed appropriate as a result of the alleged presence of domestic violence and/or child abuse.

 (b)  Unless otherwise directed by the court, the expert shall deliver to the court, to the attorneys of record for the parties, to any unrepresented party, and to the guardian ad litem and/or counsel for the child, if any, copies of any reports arising from the evaluation setting out the findings, results of all tests made, diagnosis and conclusions. No reports shall be filed of record or considered evidence unless and until admitted by the court. Any report which is prepared at the request of a party, with or without a court order, and which a party intends to introduce at trial, must be delivered to the court and the other party at least thirty days before trial. If the report or any information from the evaluator is provided to the court, the evaluator shall be subject to cross-examination by all counsel and any unrepresented party without regard to who obtains or pays for the evaluation.

 (c)  If a party refuses to obey an order of court made under subdivision (a) of this rule, the court may make an order refusing to allow the disobedient party to support or oppose designated claims or defenses, prohibiting the party from introducing in evidence designated documents, things or testimony, prohibiting the party from introducing evidence of physical or mental condition, or making such other order as is just. The willful failure or refusal of a party to comply with an order entered pursuant to this rule may also give rise to a finding of contempt and the imposition of such sanctions as may be deemed appropriate by the court, including, but not limited to, an adverse inference against the non-complying party.

 (d) A petition for contempt alleging failure to comply with an order entered pursuant to subdivision (a) of this rule shall be treated in an expedited manner.

Explanatory Comment—2007
   This rule addresses the process for any number of expert evaluations a court may order in a custody case, including, but not limited to, physical, mental health, custody and/or drug and alcohol evaluations, and/or home studies. Since the initial promulgation of this rule in 1981, the frequency of utilizing professionals as expert witnesses in child custody litigation has increased considerably. In appropriate cases, evaluations have served as a means to provide the court with a full and complete record and to facilitate settlement of the litigation.

   The proposed revisions to Rule 1915.8 are intended to afford the trial court and the parties a more flexible and case-sensitive means of determining the scope and parameters of a physical and/or mental examination, including deadlines, costs, underlying data, and access. In many instances, the previous sixty-day deadline was impractical and ignored. While some cases demanded that the evaluation be completed in less than 60 days, others demanded far more time than that. The revisions to this rule also specifically permit the trial court to draw an adverse inference from one party’s failure to comply with an order pursuant to this rule.

Rule 1915.9. No Default Judgment.
 No judgment may be entered by default or on the pleadings.

Rule 1915.10. Decision. Order.
 (a)  Decision.

   (1)  The court may decide custody before the testimony has been transcribed.

   (2)  The court shall state the reasons for its decision:

     (i)   on the record in open court; or

     (ii)   in a written opinion or order.

 (b)  Order. The court shall enter a custody order as a separate written order or in a written opinion as a separate section.

   (1)  The court’s order shall sufficiently state specific terms to enforce the order.

   (2)  If the court finds a history of abuse of the child or a household member by a party, or a present risk of harm to the child or an abused party, the court’s order shall include:

     (i)   safety provisions for the protection of the endangered party or the child;

     (ii)   the reason for imposing the safety provisions and why they are in the best interest of the child or abused party; and

     (iii)   if past abuse was committed by a party, why unsupervised physical custody is in the best interest of the child.

   (3)  The court may order that the case caption use the parties’ initials rather than the parties’ names based on the sensitive nature of the facts in the case record and the child’s best interest.

   (4)  When drafting a written opinion or order in an action having the parties’ initials in the case caption, the court shall:

     (i)   avoid using specific identifiers for people, places, or things that may indirectly reveal the child’s identity; and

     (ii)   use generalized identifiers when describing a child’s school, activities, affiliated organizations, or other similar terms.

 (c)  Party Obligations. A custody order shall include a notice outlining the parties’ obligations under:

   (1)  23 Pa.C.S. §  5337, regarding a party’s intention to relocate with a minor child; and

   (2)  Pa.R.Civ.P. 1915.3-2(a)(4), regarding a party’s ongoing obligation to complete, serve, and file, if required, the Criminal Record/Abuse History Verification form.

 (d)  No Post-Trial Relief. A party shall not file a motion for post-trial relief to an order of legal or physical custody.

Comment:
   See 23 Pa.C.S. §  5323(d) (requiring the court to delineate the reasons for its decision on the record in open court or in a written opinion or order).

   See Pa.R.Civ.P. 1930.1(a)(2) (permitting the court to order that the case caption contain the parties’ initials rather than their names in custody actions).

   See 23 Pa.C.S. §  5323(c) (requiring that an order include notice of a party’s obligations under §  5337, relating to relocation) and Pa.R.Civ.P. 1915.17 (outlining the requirements for the proposed relocation of a child’s residence).

   Subdivision (b) sets forth requirements of 23 Pa.C.S. §  5323(e)(1). Examples of safety provisions include, but are not limited to, professional supervised physical custody, a supervised or neutral custody exchange location, a neutral third-party present at custody exchanges, telephone or computer-facilitated contact with the child, no direct contact between the parties, third-party contact for cancellations, third-party transportation, and designating a secure, neutral location as repository for a child’s passport. A party may seek review by petition of the risk of harm and need for continued supervision pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S. §  5323(e)(2). For a presumption of supervised physical custody and safety provisions, see 23 Pa.C.S. §  5323(e.1).

   Additionally, subdivision (b) requires a court to enter a custody order as a separate written order or in a separate section of a written opinion. The subdivision also addresses the practice of orally entering a custody order on the record without formalizing the custody order in writing. In such circumstances, the parties’ only documentation of the custody order is a transcription of the oral record. In R.L.P. v. R.F.M., 110 A.3d 201 (Pa. Super. 2015), the Superior Court held that ‘‘in order to be sufficiently specific to be enforced, an order of custody must be entered as a separate written order, or as a separate section of a written opinion.’’ Id. at 206. Despite the Superior Court’s decision, the practice of placing custody orders on the record without subsequently entering a written order has continued, which has been problematic for enforcement and understanding of the agreement’s or order’s terms.

   Pursuant to subdivision (b)(2), the court may initialize a custody action’s case caption if the child’s privacy may be compromised by the sensitive nature of the facts in the case record. If the court determines that the case caption should be initialized, additional privacy safeguards are required under subdivision (b)(3).

   Subdivision (b)(3) recognizes that inadvertent disclosure of the child’s identity and privacy may occur if the written custody order or opinion provides specific details of the child’s life, i.e., school, extracurricular activities. Subdivision (b)(3) requires that the court refrain from using specific identifiers; instead, the court should use general terms, e.g., ‘‘high school,’’ not ‘‘John F. Kennedy High School.’’ In circumstances in which name specificity is required, such as school choice, the court should consider a separate order for that issue.

   Under no circumstance does a party’s filing of an updated Criminal Record/Abuse History Verification form impose a duty on the court to review, respond, or react to a newly revealed criminal record or abuse history unless a party petitions the court for relief.

Historical Commentary
   The following commentary related to Pa.R.Civ.P. 1915.10 is historical in nature and represents statements of the Committee at the time of rulemaking:

Explanatory Comment—2019
   Subdivision (b) further defines and reinforces the requirements in 23 Pa.C.S. §  5323(e). Examples of safety provisions include, but are not limited to, supervised physical custody, a supervised or neutral custody exchange location, a neutral third-party present at custody exchanges, telephone or computer-facilitated contact with the child, no direct contact between the parties, third-party contact for cancellations, third-party transportation, and designating a secure, neutral location as repository for a child’s passport.

   Additionally, subdivision (b) requires a court to enter a custody order as a separate written order or in a separate section of a written opinion. The subdivision also addresses the practice of orally entering a custody order on the record without formalizing the custody order in writing.

Despite the Superior Court’s decision, the practice of placing custody orders on the record without subsequently entering a written order has continued, which has been problematic for enforcement and understanding of the agreement’s or order’s terms.

Explanatory Comment—2021
   Subdivision (b)(3) allows the court discretion to initialize a custody action’s case caption when the child’s privacy may be compromised by the sensitive nature of the facts in the case record. When the court determines that the case caption should be initialized, additional privacy safeguards are required under subdivision (b)(4).

   Subdivision (b)(4) recognizes that inadvertent disclosure of the child’s identity and privacy may occur if the written custody order or opinion provides specific details of the child’s life (i.e., school, extracurricular activities). Subdivision (b)(4) requires that the court refrain from using specific identifiers; instead, the court should use general terms (i.e., high school, not John F. Kennedy High School). In circumstances in which name specificity is required, such as school choice, the court should consider a separate order for that issue.

Rule 1915.11. Appointing Child’s Attorney. Child Interview. Child Attending Proceedings.
 (a)  Appointing Child’s Attorney.

   (1)  Upon its own motion or a party’s motion, the court may appoint an attorney to represent a child who is the subject of the action.

   (2)  The court’s order appointing the child’s attorney, as provided in Pa.R.Civ.P. 1915.19, may apportion to the parties the reasonable cost of the child’s attorney.

   (3)  The child’s attorney:

     (i)   shall represent the child’s legal interest;

     (ii)   shall zealously represent the child as any other client in an attorney-client relationship; and

     (iii)   shall not act as the child’s guardian ad litem or best interest attorney as provided in Pa.R.Civ.P. 1915.11-2.

 (b)  Child Interview.

   (1)  The court may interview a child in open court or in chambers.

   (2)  If the court interviews the child, the court shall conduct the child’s interview on the record.

   (3)  If permitted by the court, a party’s attorney or a party may observe the interview.

   (4)  As part of the interview process, the court shall permit either:

     (i)   the parties’ attorneys to question the child under the court’s supervision, provided that all parties are represented by an attorney; or

     (ii)   a party’s attorney or a self-represented party to submit to the court written questions, which the court may include in its interview.

 (c)  Child Attending Proceedings. Unless ordered by the court or otherwise compelled to testify on the record, a child’s attendance at a conference, hearing, or trial is not required.

Comment—1991
   Pa.R.Civ.P. 1915.15(c) provides a form of order to appear at a conference or hearing in a custody action.

   However, the presence of a child in court is not always necessary or desirable. The experience may be traumatic and disruptive. Consequently, the child should not be required to attend a hearing or conference in every case. When the presence of a child is required and the custodial party does not voluntarily bring the child, the court may issue an order for the child’s attendance.

   Subdivision (c) has been added to Pa.R.Civ.P. 1915.11 to provide that, in the absence of an order of court, a child who is the subject of the action need not be brought to a conference or a hearing before the court. The form of order to appear provided by Pa.R.Civ.P. 1915.15(c) has been revised to implement this policy.

Comment—2022
   Although the rule states that a child is not required to attend a conference, hearing, or trial, the terminology used by a judicial district may vary for these court proceedings. The rule’s intent is to limit the child’s participation to only those proceedings in which the child will actively participate as a witness or in the court’s interview.

 (a)  Appointment.

   (1)  On its own motion or a party’s motion, the court may appoint a guardian ad litem if the court finds that the appointment is necessary for determining the child’s best interest.

   (2)  As set forth in Pa.R.Civ.P. 1915.21, the court’s order appointing the guardian ad litem may apportion to the parties the reasonable cost of the guardian ad litem.

 (b)  Qualifications. The guardian ad litem shall be a licensed attorney or licensed mental health professional.

 (c)  Duties.

   (1)  As provided in 23 Pa.C.S. §  5334, which has been suspended in part by Pa.R.Civ.P. 1915.25, the guardian ad litem shall perform the duties as enumerated in Section 5334, including representing the child’s best interest.

   (2)  The guardian ad litem shall not represent the child’s legal interest or act as the child’s legal counsel.

 (d)  Report. The guardian ad litem shall prepare a written report, which shall include specific recommendations relating to the child’s best interest.

   (1)  Child’s Statement.

     (i)   The written report may include a subject child’s statement to the guardian ad litem that would be otherwise inadmissible as hearsay under the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence, provided the requirements of Pa.R.E. 703 are satisfied.

     (ii)   A child’s statement included in the written report under subdivision (d)(1)(i) shall not be considered substantive evidence.

   (2)  The guardian ad litem shall file the written report with the prothonotary, which shall become part of the record.

   (3)  Confidential. The guardian ad litem’s filed report and a party’s filed response to the report as provided in subdivision (d)(5) shall be confidential and shall not constitute a public record.

   (4)  The guardian ad litem shall provide the report to the parties and the court when filed but not later than 20 days prior to a hearing or trial or as otherwise ordered by the court.

   (5)  Comments. Objections.

     (i)   Within ten days of receiving the guardian ad litem’s report, a party may file with the prothonotary and serve on the other party and the court:

       (A)   a comment to the report, which shall become part of the record; or

       (B)   an objection to the report’s admissibility, in whole or in part, including a subject child’s statement to the guardian ad litem.

     (ii)   The court shall determine the report’s admissibility prior to the hearing or trial.

   (6)  Subject to Pa.R.Civ.P. 1915.11, a party may subpoena:

     (i)   an individual interviewed by the guardian ad litem or identified in the report to appear and testify at the hearing or trial; or

     (ii)   the guardian ad litem for the production of a document relied upon by the guardian ad litem in preparing the report.

 (e)  Testimony.

   (1)  When determined necessary by the trial court, the guardian ad litem shall participate in court proceedings by attending, and by providing sworn testimony if called to testify by a party or the court. The guardian ad litem shall not be permitted to provide argument, unsworn opinions, or unsworn testimony to the court.

   (2)  If called to testify by a party, the guardian ad litem shall be subject to cross-examination by opposing parties. If called to testify by the court, the guardian ad litem shall be subject to cross-examination by any party.

   (3)  Child’s Statement.

     (i)   Except as precluded by the court in subdivision (d)(5)(ii), the guardian ad litem’s testimony may include the subject child’s statement to the guardian ad litem that would be otherwise inadmissible as hearsay under the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence, provided the requirements of Pa.R.E. 703 are satisfied.

     (ii)   A child’s statement included in the guardian ad litem’s testimony under subdivision (e)(3)(i) shall not be considered substantive evidence.

 (f)  Order. The order appointing a guardian ad litem shall be substantially in the form set forth in Pa.R.Civ.P. 1915.21.

Comment:
   Subdivision (a)(1) states that the guardian ad litem may be appointed when ‘‘the appointment is necessary.’’ Such appointments should be limited to extraordinary cases in which the trial judge determines that the level of conflict is unusually high or that the parties will be absolutely unable to provide the court with the information necessary to evaluate and determine the subject child’s best interests. Regardless of appointment of a GAL, the duty and responsibility to determine the best interests of the children involved lies solely with the trial judge.

   The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania suspended 23 Pa.C.S. §  5334 insofar as it (1) requires that a guardian ad litem be an attorney, (2) permits the guardian ad litem to represent both the best interests and legal interests of the child, (3) provides the guardian ad litem the right to examine, cross-examine, present witnesses, and present evidence on behalf of the child, and (4) prohibits the guardian ad litem from testifying.

   See 23 Pa.C.S. §  5336, prohibiting disclosure of certain records and information to parents and parties.

   Subdivision (d)(1) and (e)(3) reference the requirements of Pa.R.E. 703. Rule 703 relates to the bases for expert opinion testimony. While the requirements of Rule 703 must be satisfied for any written report that includes statements made by a subject child, the guardian ad litem is not an expert witness and need not be qualified as an expert prior to testifying. However, the guardian ad litem

   In addition, the guardian ad litem cannot serve as a mere conduit for hearsay or for the opinions of another person, including the subject child. The guardian ad litem cannot relate the opinion of a non-testifying witness unless the guardian ad litem has reasonably relied upon it. Upon appropriate objection from any party, the trial court shall strike any testimony or portion of the guardian ad litem’s written report that is inadmissible as hearsay if the requirements for Pa.R.E. 703 are not met.

   Subdivision (d)(6) provides that a party may subpoena an individual interviewed by the guardian ad litem, an individual that is identified in the guardian ad litem’s report, or a document relied upon by the guardian ad litem in producing the report. The subdivision shall not be construed to limit a party’s ability to subpoena other individuals or for the production of documents for a trial or hearing, or for discovery purposes, if the court had previously authorized discovery pursuant to Pa.R.Civ.P. 1915.5(c). remains subject to questions and cross-examination regarding qualifications and experience.

Rule 1915.13. Special Relief.
 At any time after commencement of the action, the court may on application or its own motion grant appropriate interim or special relief. The relief may include, but is not limited to, the award of temporary legal or physical custody; the issuance of appropriate process directing that a child or a party or person having physical custody of a child be brought before the court; and a direction that a person post security to appear with the child when directed by the court or to comply with any order of the court.

   Official Note

   This rule supplies relief formerly available by habeas corpus for production of the child.

Explanatory Comment—1981
   Rule 1915.13 contains a broad provision empowering the court to provide special relief where appropriate. In a custody proceeding, such special relief might include relief in the nature of a writ of ne exeat, directing the parties not to leave the jurisdiction and not to remove the child from the jurisdiction.

   The rule catalogs several types of relief which might be granted, including the entry of a temporary order of custody, partial custody or visitation. The rule specifically provides that the power of the court to grant special relief shall not be limited to the types of relief cataloged.

Comment:
   The form of complaint is appropriate if there is one plaintiff, one defendant, and the custody of one child is sought or the custody of several children is sought, and the information required by Paragraphs 3 to 7 is identical for all of the children. If there are more than two parties, the complaint should be appropriately adapted to accommodate them. If the custody of several children is sought and the information required is not identical for all of the children, the complaint should contain a separate paragraph for each child.

   Pa.R.Civ.P. 1930.1(b) may require attorneys or unrepresented parties to file confidential documents and documents containing confidential information that are subject to the Case Records Public Access Policy of the Unified Judicial System of Pennsylvania.

Historical Commentary
   The following commentary related to Pa.R.Civ.P. 1915.15 is historical in nature and represents statements of the Committee at the time of rulemaking:

Explanatory Comment—2008
   In an effort to promote uniformity of practice throughout the Commonwealth, several forms are included in the rules. Two aspects of these forms are worthy of mention. First, much of the information which must be set forth in the complaint is required by the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, 23 Pa.C.S.A. §  5429. Second, the complaint is verified by use of a statement that it is subject to the penalties of the Crimes Code relating to unsworn falsification to authorities. A notary public is not needed.

Explanatory Comment—2020
   Act of May 4, 2018, P.L. 112, No. 21, amended 23 Pa.C.S. §  5324 by adding a new class of third-party standing for individuals seeking custody of a child whose parents do not have care and control of the child. The individual seeking custody may or may not be related to the child. Subject to the limitations in 23 Pa.C.S. §  5324(5), the newly added standing provision requires that: (1) the individual has assumed or is willing to assume responsibility for the child; (2) the individual has a sustained, substantial, and sincere interest in the child’s welfare; and (3) the child’s parents do not have care and control of the child. A plaintiff proceeding under Section 5324(4) shall satisfy the requirements of that provision by clear and convincing evidence. Additionally, if a juvenile dependency proceeding has been initiated, or is ongoing, or if there is an order for permanent legal custody, Section 5324(5) provides that an individual cannot assert standing under Section 5324(4).

   Consistent with the Act’s statutory change, the Complaint for Custody Paragraph 9 has been revised to include a third party seeking custody of a child under 23 Pa.C.S. §  5324(4) and has been reorganized to sequentially follow the statutory provisions in 23 Pa.C.S. § §  5324(2)—(4) and 5325. Similarly, Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.3(e) has been reorganized to sequentially follow the statutory provision sequence. See Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.3(e).

 (1) Except as set forth in subdivision (2), the caption in a domestic relations matter shall include the parties’ full names. The form of the caption shall be substantially in the following form:

 In the Court of Common Pleas of _______________ County, Pennsylvania.



Party A’s full name,	)

(Title of Pleading)
   (2)  In a custody action, the court may order that the case caption contain the parties’ initials rather than the parties’ names based on the sensitive nature of the facts in the case record and the child’s best interest.

   Official Note

   See Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.10(b)(3).

 (b)  Unless public access is otherwise constrained by applicable authority, any attorney, or any party if unrepresented, who files a document pursuant to these rules with the prothonotary’s office shall comply with the requirements of Sections 7.0 and 8.0 of the Case Records Public Access Policy of the Unified Judicial System of Pennsylvania (Policy) including a certification of compliance with the Policy and, as necessary, a Confidential Information Form or a Confidential Document Form in accordance with the Policy.

Comment
   Applicable authority includes but is not limited to statute, procedural rule, or court order. The Case Records Public Access Policy of the Unified Judicial System of Pennsylvania (Policy) can be found on the website of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania at https://www.pacourts.us/public-records. Sections 7.0(D) and 8.0(D) of the Policy provide that the certification shall be in substantially the following form:

   

  I certify that this filing complies with the provisions of the Case Records Public Access Policy of the Unified Judicial System of Pennsylvania that require filing confidential information and documents differently than non-confidential information and documents.

   The Confidential Information Form and the Confidential Document Form can be found at https://www.pacourts.us/public-records.

Explanatory Comment—2021
   Subdivision (a)(1) requires that the parties’ full names are used in a domestic relations case caption unless the court determines it necessary to protect the child’s identity by initializing the case caption in a custody action based on sensitive facts in the case and the child’s best interest. Generally, a child custody case does not include sensitive information or egregious facts that would cause embarrassment to a child and necessitate exceptional privacy measures; however, in the unusual circumstance that a custody action has egregious facts that may cause an issue for the child, the trial court would have the discretion to initialize the caption in order to maintain the child’s privacy interests.

   Subdivision (a)(2) provides the exception to the general rule in subdivision (a)(1) for a custody action in which the court deems that the child could be adversely affected by the sensitive nature of the facts in the record. In a custody case in which the trial court determines the child’s best interest requires an initialized caption, Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915-10(b)(4) requires that additional privacy safeguards are in the written custody order or opinion entered by the court.

   The rule’s requirement that a case caption use the parties’ full names does not alter a party’s or an attorney’s responsibilities under the Case Records Public Access Policy of the Unified Judicial System of Pennsylvania and subdivision (b).

   The provisions of this Chapter 1940 adopted October 28, 1999, effective immediately, 30 Pa.B. 5820, unless otherwise noted.

Rule 1940.1. Applicability of Rules to Mediation.
 The rules in this chapter shall apply to all court-established custody mediation programs and to any court-ordered mediation of individual custody cases.

Rule 1940.2. Definitions.
 As used in this Chapter, the following terms shall have the following meanings:

   ‘‘Mediation,’’ the confidential process by which a neutral mediator assists the parties in attempting to reach a mutually acceptable agreement on issues arising in a custody action. Mediation is not a court proceeding; rather, it is an independent, non-record proceeding in lieu of court involvement for the purpose of assisting the parties to address the child’s best interest. An agreement reached by the parties must be based on the voluntary decisions of the parties and not the decision of the mediator. The agreement may resolve all or only some of the disputed issues. The parties are required to mediate in good faith but are not compelled to reach an agreement. While mediation is an alternative means of conflict resolution, it is not a substitute for the benefit of legal advice. The participants in mediation shall be limited to the parties to the custody action, primarily the child’s parents and persons acting as parents. Except as provided in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1940.5(c), non-parties, including children, grandparents, and the parties’ attorneys, shall not participate in the mediation.

   Official Note

   See Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.1 for the definition of a person acting as a parent.

   ‘‘Memorandum of Understanding,’’ the written document prepared by a mediator that contains and summarizes the resolution reached by the parties during mediation. A Memorandum of Understanding is primarily for the benefit of the parties and is not legally binding on either party.

   ‘‘Orientation Session,’’ the initial process of educating the parties on the mediation process so that they can make an informed choice about continued participation in mediation. This process may be mandated by the court and may be structured to include either group or individual sessions. An orientation session may also include an educational program for parents and children on the process of divorce and separation and the benefits of mediation in resolving custody disputes.

   The provisions of this Rule 1940.2 amended February 8, 2018, effective April 1, 2018, 48 Pa.B. 1095. Immediately preceding text appears at serial page (305183).

Rule 1940.3. Order for Orientation Session and Mediation. Selection of Mediator.
 (a)  Except as provided in (b), the court may order the parties to attend an orientation session at any time upon motion by a party, stipulation of the parties, or the court’s own initiative.

 (b)  The court may not order an orientation session if a party or a child of either party is or has been the subject of domestic violence or child abuse either during the pendency of the action or within 24 months preceding the filing of the action.

   Official Note

   See also Rule 1940.6(a)(4) requiring termination of mediation when the mediator finds that the proceeding is ‘‘inappropriate’’ for mediation. The mediator has a continuing ethical obligation, consistent with Rule 1940.4(b), during the mediation to screen for abuse and to terminate the mediation in the event he or she determines that the abuse renders the case unsuitable for mediation.

 (c)  Following the orientation session and with the consent of the parties, the court may refer the parties to mediation. The mediation may address any issues agreed to by the parties unless limited by court order.

Rule 1940.4. Minimum Qualifications of the Mediator.
 (a)  A mediator must have at least the following qualifications:

   (1)  a bachelor’s degree and practical experience in law, psychiatry, psychology, counseling, family therapy or any comparable behavioral or social science field;

   (2)  successful completion of basic training in domestic and family violence or child abuse and a divorce and custody mediation program approved by the Association for Conflict Resolution, American Bar Association, American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, or Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts;

   (3)  mediation professional liability insurance; and

   (4)  additional mediation training consisting of a minimum of 4 mediated cases totaling 10 hours under the supervision of a mediator who has complied with subdivisions (1) through (3) above and is approved by the court to supervise other mediators.

 (b)  The mediator shall comply with the ethical standards of the mediator profession as well as those of his or her primary profession and complete at least 20 hours of continuing education every two years in topics related to family mediation.

 (c)  A post-graduate student enrolled in a state or federally accredited educational institution in the disciplines of law, psychiatry, psychology, counseling, family therapy or any comparable behavioral or social science field may mediate with direct and actual supervision by a qualified mediator.

Rule 1940.5. Duties of the Mediator. Role of the Mediator.
 (a)  As part of the orientation session, the mediator must inform the parties in writing of the following:

   (1)  the costs of mediation;

   Official Note

   Pa.R.C.P. No. 240 sets forth the procedures for obtaining leave to proceed in forma pauperis when the parties do not have the financial resources to pay the costs of litigation. This rule applies to court-connected mediation services as well, so that parties without sufficient resources may file a petition seeking a waiver or reduction of the costs of mediation.

   (2)  the process of mediation;

   (3)  that the mediator does not represent either or both of the parties;

   (4)  the nature and extent of any relationships with the parties and any personal, financial, or other interests that could result in a bias or conflict of interest;

   (5)  that mediation is not a substitute for the benefit of independent legal advice; and

   (6)  that the parties should obtain legal assistance for drafting any agreement or for reviewing any agreement drafted by the other party.

 (b)  When mediating a custody dispute, the mediator shall ensure that the parties consider fully the best interests of the child or children.

 (c)  With the consent of the parties, the mediator may meet with the parties’ children or invite other persons to participate in the mediation.

 (d)  The role of the mediator is to assist the parties in identifying the issues, reducing misunderstandings, clarifying priorities, exploring areas of compromise, and finding points of agreement.

Rule 1940.6. Termination of Mediation.
 (a)  Mediation shall terminate upon the earliest of the following circumstances to occur:

   (1)  a determination by the mediator that the parties are unable to reach a resolution regarding all of the issues subject to mediation;

   (2)  a determination by the mediator that the parties have reached a resolution regarding all of the issues subject to mediation;

   (3)  a determination by the mediator that the parties have reached a partial resolution and that further mediation will not resolve the remaining issues subject to mediation; or

   (4)  a determination by the mediator that the proceedings are inappropriate for mediation.

 (b)  If the parties reach a complete or partial resolution, the mediator shall, within 14 days, prepare and transmit to the parties a Memorandum of Understanding. At the request of a party, the mediator shall also transmit a copy of the Memorandum of Understanding to the party’s counsel.

 (c)  If no resolution is reached during mediation, the mediator shall, within 14 days, report this in writing to the court, without further explanation.

Rule 1940.7. Mediator Compensation.
 Mediators shall be compensated for their services at a rate to be established by each court.

Rule 1940.8. Sanctions.
 On its own motion or a party’s motion, the court may impose sanctions against any party or attorney who fails to comply or causes a party not to comply with these mediation rules. Sanctions may include an award of mediation costs and attorney fees, including those reasonably incurred in pursuing the sanctions.

   Official Note

   To the extent court orders are employed to direct parties regarding mediation, contempt proceedings may also be instituted to enforce these orders.

Rule 1940.9. Effective Date.
 These rules shall not affect any existing mediation program established in any judicial district pursuant to local rule prior to October 29, 1999. However, any changes or amendments to any existing program shall be consistent with these rules.

Explanatory Note
   The 1978 amendments to the Deposition and Discovery Rules represent the culmination of a continuing and comprehensive review of the operation of the 1950 Rules and of the Federal Discovery and Deposition Rules as completely revised in 1970.

   The Pennsylvania Rules have never been identical with the Federal Rules. From the beginning, it was felt that the differences between federal and state practice did not permit any such identity. Also, the difference in the amounts involved in federal cases and in state cases had an important effect twenty-five years ago. The 1970 federal revisions effected even wider differences, particularly in the discovery of reports, memoranda, statements or other things secured in anticipation of litigation or in preparation for trial.

   More than twenty-five years of experience and the general acceptance of the philosophy of discovery justify bringing the Pennsylvania system into as close conformity as possible with the federal system. The differences between state and federal practice still prevent absolute identity.

   The Federal Rules as last revised have been used as a model, but the Civil Procedural Rules Committee has not hesitated to depart from Federal language where it has acquired a questionable gloss or has received inconsistent interpretations in the courts.

   It was considered important to retain as far as possible the rule numbering and the internal arrangement of the Pennsylvania Rules. Since 1950, the Rules have been the subject of numerous decisions, commentary, and articles. Many of the Rules are left unchanged. The advantages of retaining the present Rule numbers as closely as possible far outweigh any benefits of a so-called ‘‘functional’’ rearrangement which would require a complete new numbering system.

   New material is introduced by the use of decimal numbering. Certain Rules have been subdivided, e.g., 4003.1, 4003.2, etc. This retains the numbering of Rules dealing with particular subject matter. Federal source material is identified in the detailed discussion of the amendments which follows.

   The amendments recognize that no effective system of discovery can be designed which is not subject to abuse, resulting in delay, expense and the burden on judges of disposing of dilatory motions, petitions and objections without real merit.

   The amendments have not ignored the recent criticisms directed to the federal discovery procedures, particularly the capacity for abusive discovery with its escalation of costs and delay of adjudication. Nor have they ignored the recent proposals of the American Bar Association’s Special Committee of the Section of Litigation. These proposals, even if ultimately adopted by the United States Supreme Court, would not appear to be of sufficient significance, in view of the differences between state and federal practice, to delay the promulgation of these amendments. If any of the proposals of the American Bar Association should ultimately be adopted as amendments to the Federal Rules and found appropriate to Pennsylvania practice, further amendments to these Rules can easily be made.

   Most of these problems can be avoided by self discipline of the bar and by more effective judicial administration. Sanctions are available for disobedience of an order compelling compliance with the Rules. Although there is an understandable reluctance on the part of bench and bar to request or to impose sanctions, particularly sanctions against counsel, it may be necessary to do so from time to time to make the system work. Also, assignment to an individual judge who would regulate the entire course of the discovery proceedings, especially in large and complex cases, could help prevent dilatory, burdensome or oppressive conduct. It will also serve to reduce the possibility of inconsistent rulings by different judges during the course of discovery. Frequent pre-trial conferences in complex cases should help.

   The final text of the amendments profited from the many valuable criticisms and suggestions which followed the circulation of Recommendation No. 44. All suggestions received from the bench and bar were reviewed by the Civil Procedural Rules Committee and many of them were incorporated in the amendments.

   Before proceeding to a detailed analysis of the amendments, a brief outline of some of the major changes may be helpful.

   First, the scope of discovery is broadened to conform closely to the Federal Rules. The scope of discovery under our 1950 Rules was limited to ‘‘any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the action and will substantially aid in the preparation of the pleadings or the preparation or trial of the case.’’

   Under the Federal Rules, discovery may be obtained as to ‘‘any matter, not privileged, relevant to the subject matter’’ and it ‘‘is not ground for objection that the information sought’’ is not itself relevant if it ‘‘appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.’’

   The amendments do not include the recent proposal of the American Bar Association’s Section of Litigation for an amendment to Fed. R. Civ.P. 26(b) to restrict discovery to matters ‘‘relevant to the issues’’ rather than ‘‘relevant to the subject matter.’’ It has been suggested that the proposal for amendment would prevent fishing expeditions. Adequate machinery already exists under both the Federal and our Rules to prevent such abuse. Further, the ABA proposal runs the risk of increasing preliminary disputes over the propriety of discovery, since the ‘‘issues’’ may not be subject to accurate definition until after discovery is complete.

   Second, Rule 4011(d), which has prohibited discovery of the existence or location of reports, memoranda, statements, information or other things made or secured in anticipation of litigation or in preparation for trial, has been rescinded.

   Trial preparation material, including statements of witnesses whether taken by a lawyer or investigator, will now be fully discoverable, except that the mental impressions of a party’s attorney or his conclusions, opinions, memoranda, notes or summaries, legal research or legal theories are protected from discovery. The representatives of a party other than the party’s attorney are protected from disclosure of mental impressions, conclusions or opinions respecting the value or merit of a claim or defense or respecting strategy or tactics.

   A witness will now be entitled, merely upon request, to receive a copy of his own statement from the party in possession of it, and a party will now be entitled to a copy of his own statement plus copies of all statements of all witnesses in the possession of an adverse party.

   Third, Rules 4011(f) which has regulated discovery of expert testimony has also been rescinded. In its place, Rule 4003.5 provides for discovery from expert witnesses and limits the use at trial of expert witnesses whose identity has been withheld or of testimony which is inconsistent with the disclosures in the discovery proceedings.

   Fourth, present Rule 4009 governing the production of documents and things and inspection of property is revised to conform to Fed. R.Civ.P. 34. A written request for production or inspection will now suffice; a court order is no longer required to initiate a production or inspection.

   Fifth, the burden of ascertaining the proper officers, agents or employees of large organizations to be deposed is substantially reduced. If the party seeking discovery discloses with reasonable particularity the matter on which he seeks to depose the witnesses, the organization is required to designate the officers, directors, agents or others who will testify as to those matters.

   Sixth, the burden of answering interrogatories requesting information to be derived or ascertained from the records of the answering party may be met by specifying the records which contain the information and offering the inquiring party reasonable opportunity to inspect and copy the same, if the burden of deriving the information from the records would be substantially the same for both parties. This enlarges the Federal Rule by making it applicable to all records; the Federal Rule applies only to ‘‘business’’ records.

   Seventh, the federal provisions for sequence and timing of discovery, not now dealt with in our prior Rules, are included in the amended Rules.

   Eighth, the scope of requests for admissions and interrogatories to parties is enlarged. They are no longer objectionable if they require an answer which involves an opinion or contention that relates to a fact or the application of law to fact. This follows the Federal Rule. The effect of failure to admit is clarified and pre-trial procedures for determining the extent of an admission are provided.

   Ninth, the use at trial of an oral deposition of a medical witness, other than a party, is broadened to permit its use whether or not the witness is available to testify. The prior practice permitted this only as to videotape depositions.

   Tenth, the time periods prescribed by the prior Rule for the doing of any act are revised to conform to those prescribed by the Federal Rules.

   Finally, the Rules are expressly made applicable to eminent domain proceedings. They are also applicable in divorce and in support and custody proceedings to the extent provided by the rules governing those proceedings.

   The details of the amendments follow.

   [Detailed notes follow their respective Rules.]

Rule 4001. Scope. Definitions.
 (a)  The rules of this chapter apply to any civil action or proceeding brought in or appealed to any court which is subject to these rules including any action pursuant to the Eminent Domain Code of 1964 or the Municipal Claims Act of 1923.

   Official Note

   Rule 1701(b)(4) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure permits a lower court to authorize the taking of depositions or the preservation of testimony in the interest of justice after an appeal is taken. The procedure under these rules is applicable to such depositions.

   See Rule 1930.5 governing discovery in domestic relations matters and specifying when leave of court is and is not required. See also Rules 1910.9 and 1915.5(c) governing discovery in actions for support and custody, respectively.

 (b)  As used in this chapter, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise,

   ‘‘court’’ means the court in which the action is pending;

   ‘‘deposition’’ includes a deposition upon written

   ‘‘trial’’ includes a hearing before arbitrators or viewers.

   Official Note

   These rules apply to an action pending in the court of common pleas and referred to compulsory arbitration under Section 7361 of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. §  7361.

 (c)  Subject to the provisions of this chapter, any party may take the testimony of any person, including a party, by deposition upon oral examination or written interrogatories for the purpose of discovery, or for preparation of pleadings, or for preparation or trial of a case, or for use at a hearing upon petition, motion or rule, or for any combination of the foregoing purposes.

   Official Note

   See Rule 4003.8 governing pre-complaint discovery.

 (d)  Subject to the provisions of this chapter, any party may obtain discovery by one or more of the following methods: depositions upon oral examination (Rule 4007.1) or written interrogatories (Rule 4004); written interrogatories to a party (Rule 4005); production of documents and things and entry for inspection and other purposes (Rule 4009); physical and mental examinations (Rule 4010); and requests for admission (Rule 4014).

   Official Note

   Under subdivision (d), for example, a party may discover documents and things in the possession of a person not a party by means of a subpoena duces tecum issued in connection with a deposition upon oral examination under Rule 4007.1, a subpoena for the production of documents and things under Rule 4009.21 et seq., and an independent action.

Explanatory Note
   The amendments to Rule 4001 are designed to achieve three principal purposes. First, to designate specifically the actions and proceedings subject to the Rules. Second, to designate the purposes of a deposition and of discovery. Third, to provide at the outset as does amended Fed. R.Civ.P. 26(a), a catalogue of the armory of discovery procedures available. (Rule 4001(d))

   Before the amendment, Rule 4001(a) stated a scope which included ‘‘any civil action or proceeding at law or in equity brought in or appealed to any court which is subject to these rules.’’ Taken literally, these words embrace every conceivable form of action. They are unchanged by these amendments. However, the application of the Rules to eminent domain and to divorce, custody and support proceedings was not uniform. The amendments clarify the application of the Rules to those proceedings.

   Viewers’ proceedings to assess damages in eminent domain actions were historically brought in the Courts of Quarter Sessions, which were courts not originally subject to the Rules of Civil Procedure. Even after the enactment of the Eminent Domain Code of 1963, vesting jurisdiction over eminent domain proceedings in the unified Common Pleas Court, Sec. 703(2) of the Eminent Domain Code provided only for limited discovery of experts’ valuation reports on appeal to the Common Pleas, provided they had not already testified before the viewers. The Code made no provision whatsoever for discovery for use in the initial proceedings before viewers. The viewers’ proceedings were the discovery proceedings. This often left litigants at a disadvantage before the viewers, in some cases leading to needless appeals.

   The amendment to Rule 4001(a) makes clear that the entire chapter of deposition and discovery proceedings applies at all stages of an eminent domain action.

   ‘‘Trial’’ is defined in Rule 4001(b) specifically to include proceedings before ‘‘viewers’’ and also ‘‘arbitrators.’’

   Control of the deposition and discovery procedure at the viewers’ and arbitrators’ stage will remain in the court. The viewers and arbitrators are not empowered to grant protective orders, impose sanctions or to take other action authorized by the Rules. The court in its order appointing viewers might consider establishing a cut-off date for completion of discovery so that the viewers’ hearings will not be unduly delayed. Or the viewers could set a cut-off date for hearing to afford opportunity for discovery.

   In the Orphans’ Court Division, Supreme Court Orphans’ Court Rule 3.6 provides that the local Orphans’ Courts by general rule or special order may prescribe the practice relating to depositions, discovery, production of documents, and perpetuation of testimony. To the extent not provided by general rule or special order, the Orphans’ Court Rule provides that the practice relating to such matters shall conform to the practice in the trial or civil division of the local Court of Common Pleas. As a result, some courts have adopted local rules which require leave of court in all Orphans’ Court Division cases. Others limit discovery in varying degrees. Others have adopted no local rules, thereby incorporating these Rules in toto. Under a unified court system and statewide practice, this lack of uniformity is undesirable. However, the Orphans’ Court Rules are independent and cannot be regulated by the Civil Procedural Rules.

   Where leave of court is required, application for leave is required in each individual proceeding. A local rule authorizing discovery in all cases without an individual application and a hearing would be inconsistent with the Rule. Further, it would be inconsistent with statewide practice and would permit non-uniformity of practice in the important area of discovery and depositions.

   Leave of court is further discussed in Rule 4007.2.

   The Committee considered but rejected the radical suggestion that all depositions and discovery, except depositions of aged, infirm, or going witnesses, should require leave of court. While this suggestion would undoubtedly limit the possibility of abusive discovery, it would add enormously to the burden on court and counsel. Multiple petitions, answers, briefs and hearings would be required in practically every case. This is unjustifiable. The courts, through protective orders and sanctions, should be able to control abuse of the discovery process. The limited use of leave of court in specific actions strikes a more equitable balance.

   Sub-divisions (c) and (d), which state the permissible purposes of depositions and discovery, and list the procedural devices available, effect no change. They consolidate stylistically the existing practice.

Explanatory Note—1999
   Rule of Civil Procedure 4001(a) was amended in 1997 to eliminate reference to discovery in the domestic relations actions of support, custody of minor children and divorce or annulment of marriage. Discovery in those actions is governed by Rule 1930.5.

Rule 4002. Agreement Regarding Discovery or Deposition Procedure.
 The parties may by agreement (1) provide that depositions may be taken before any person, at any time or place, upon any notice, and in any manner, and when so taken may be used like other depositions, and (2) modify the procedures provided by these rules for methods of discovery.

   Official Note

   See Rule 201 for advisability of writing.

Explanatory Note
   The amendments of this Rule make two changes in present practice.

   First, they enlarge the rights of the parties by permitting them to agree to modify the procedures for discovery as well as for the taking of depositions. This will be broader than Fed. R. Civ.P. 29 as amended in 1970. The Federal Rule requires court approval of any agreement to extend the time for responses in three instances during the discovery stage. The amendments to Rule 4002 do not incorporate this limitation. The need for leave of court to extend time may act as a spur to prompt responses but it must be balanced against the need for conservation of judicial manpower of already overburdened courts. Busy judges normally approve stipulations of counsel with respect to extra-judicial matters at the early stages of litigation. Little will be gained as a practical matter by requiring leave, and the need for hearing could actually accentuate delay. If one party agrees to give his opponent extra time to answer, why should the judge intervene and refuse?

   Second, the phrase ‘‘stipulate in writing’’ in the prior Rule is changed to read ‘‘by agreement.’’ This will validate the common practice during the taking of oral depositions of dictating various stipulations to the reporter for inclusion in the transcript. Technically such a stipulation is not an‘‘agreement in writing’’ within the meaning of the Business of the Court Rule 201 and is not an agreement ‘‘at bar’’ since no judge is present and the deposition is not taken in a courtroom.

   Counsel will be well advised to confirm such agreements in writing to avoid misunderstandings.

Source
   The provisions of this Rule 4003 rescinded November 20, 1978, effective April 16, 1979, 8 Pa.B. 3551. Immediately preceding text appears at serial page (16015).

Rule 4003.1. Scope of Discovery Generally. Opinions and Contentions.
 (a)  Subject to the provisions of Rules 4003.2 to 4003.5 inclusive and Rule 4011, a party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action, whether it relates to the claim or defense of the party seeking discovery or to the claim or defense of any other party, including the existence, description, nature, content, custody, condition and location of any books, documents, or other tangible things and the identity and location of persons having knowledge of any discoverable matter.

 (b)  It is not ground for objection that the information sought will be inadmissible at the trial if the information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

 (c)  Except as otherwise provided by these rules, it is not ground for objection that the information sought involves an opinion or contention that relates to a fact or the application of law to fact.

   Official Note

   Interrogatories that generally require the responding party to state the basis of particular claims, defenses or contentions made in pleadings or other documents should be used sparingly and, if used, should be designed to target claims, defenses or contentions that the propounding attorney reasonably suspects may be the proper subjects of early dismissal or resolution or, alternatively, to identify and to narrow the scope of claims, defenses and contentions made where the scope is unclear.

Explanatory Note
   Prior Rule 4003 has been deleted. It had embodied a number of disparate subjects, including the deposition of aged, infirm and going witnesses, the deposition of witnesses more than 100 miles from the courthouse, depositions for use at a hearing on a petition, motion or rule, and notice of depositions on oral examination. These subjects have been functionally rearranged and transposed to other Rules.

   Depositions of aged, going and infirm witnesses and witnesses more than 100 miles from the courthouse are now regulated by Rule 4007.2(b). The use of depositions at a hearing on petition, motion or rule is authorized by Rule 4001(c). Notice of depositions on oral examination is now regulated by Rule 4007.1.

   Under the prior practice, an argument might have been made that there was no sanction available against a party who refused to appear for a deposition for use in connection with a petition, motion or rule. The amendments preclude any such argument, since there is now a unified notice system for all oral depositions for all purposes. See Rules 4001(c), 4007.1 and 4019(a)(1).

   To use the place vacated by Rule 4003, new Rules 4003.1 through 4003.5 have been added. They deal with the scope of discovery. Rule 4003.1 delineates generally the scope of discovery. It is taken almost verbatim from Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b).

   Rules 4003.2 through 4003.5 deal with specific aspects of the scope of discovery, such as discovery of insurance, discovery of trial preparation material generally, discovery of statements of parties or witnesses, and discovery of facts known and opinions held by experts. They are based closely on Fed. R.Civ.P. 26(b)(2), (3) and (4). Separate comment on each new Rule follows.

   Rule 4003.1 incorporates the broad Federal discovery rule and replaces former Rule 4007(a), which had provided a more limited scope of discovery. Rule 4007(a) limited discovery to any matter not privileged which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the action and ‘‘will substantially aid in the preparation of the pleadings or the preparation or trial of the case.’’ Fed. R.Civ.P. 26(b)(1), from which Rule 4003.1 is taken almost verbatim, permits discovery of all relevant matter not privileged, whether it relates to a claim or defense. It is not restricted to preparation of pleadings or the trial of the case. It is not ground for objection that the information sought will be inadmissible at the trial if the information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to discovery of admissible evidence.

   Further widening of the scope of discovery follows from the deletion of former Rules 4011(d) and 4011(f), which restricted discovery of material prepared for trial or in anticipation of litigation and discovery of expert opinions. The effect of these omissions is discussed in the comments to Rules 4003.3, 4003.4 and 4003.5.

Immediately preceding text appears at serial pages (209473) to (209474).

Rule 4003.2. Scope of Discovery. Insurance.
 A party may obtain discovery of the existence and terms of any insurance agreement under which any person carrying on an insurance business may be liable to satisfy part or all of a judgment which may be entered in the action or to indemnify or reimburse for payments made to satisfy the judgment. Information concerning the insurance agreement is not by reason of such disclosure admissible in evidence at trial. For the purposes of this paragraph, an application for insurance shall not be treated as part of an insurance agreement.

Explanatory Note
   Proposed Rule 4003.2 is taken almost verbatim from Fed. R.Civ.P. 26(b)(2). It codifies the decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in Szarmack v. Welch, 456 Pa. 293, 318 A.2d 707 (1974), permitting discovery of insurance. It makes no change in present practice.

Rule 4003.3. Scope of Discovery. Trial Preparation Material Generally.
 Subject to the provisions of Rules 4003.4 and 4003.5, a party may obtain discovery of any matter discoverable under Rule 4003.1 even though prepared in anticipation of litigation or trial by or for another party or by or for that other party’s representative, including his or her attorney, consultant, surety, indemnitor, insurer or agent. The discovery shall not include disclosure of the mental impressions of a party’s attorney or his or her conclusions, opinions, memoranda, notes or summaries, legal research or legal theories. With respect to the representative of a party other than the party’s attorney, discovery shall not include disclosure of his or her mental impressions, conclusions or opinions respecting the value or merit of a claim or defense or respecting strategy or tactics.

Explanatory Note
   The amended Rule radically changes the prior practice as to discovery of documents, reports and tangible things prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial by or for another party or by or for that party’s representative, including his attorney, consultant, surety, indemnitor, insurer or agent.

   Former Rule 4011(d) expressly prohibited such discovery. The amended Rule permits it, subject to the limitation that discovery of the work product of an attorney may not include disclosure of the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, memoranda, notes, legal research or legal theories of an attorney. As to any other representative of a party, it protects the representative’s disclosure of his mental impressions, conclusions or opinions respecting the value or merit of a claim or defense or respecting strategy or tactics. Memoranda or notes made by the representative are not protected.

   The essential purpose of the Rule is to keep the files of counsel free from examination by the opponent, insofar as they do not include written statements of witnesses, documents or property which belong to the client or third parties, or other matter which is not encompassed in the broad category of the ‘‘work product’’ of the lawyer. Documents, otherwise subject to discovery, cannot be immunized by depositing them in the lawyer’s file. The Rule is carefully drawn and means exactly what it says. It immunizes the lawyer’s mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, memoranda, notes, summaries, legal research and legal theories, nothing more.

   There are, however, situations under the Rule where the legal opinion of an attorney becomes a relevant issue in an action; for example, an action for malicious prosecution or abuse of process where the defense is based on a good faith reliance on a legal opinion of counsel. The opinion becomes a relevant piece of evidence for the defendant, upon which defendant will rely. The opinion, even though it may have been sought in anticipation of possible future litigation, is not protected against discovery. A defendant may not base his defense upon an opinion of counsel and at the same time claim that it is immune from pre-trial disclosure to the plaintiff.

   As to representatives of a party, and sometimes an attorney, there may be situations where his conclusions or opinion as to the value or merit of a claim, not discoverable in the original litigation, should be discoverable in subsequent litigation. For example, suit is brought against an insurance carrier for unreasonable refusal to settle, resulting in a judgment against the insured in an amount in excess of the insurance coverage. Here discovery and inspection should be permitted in camera where required to weed out protected material.

   In two respects the amended Rule differs materially from Fed. R.Civ.P. 26(b)(3). First, the Federal Rule permits discovery only when the party seeking discovery shows substantial need of the materials in the preparation of his case and is unable, without undue hardship, to obtain a substantial equivalent of the materials by other means. Under the general provisions of Rule 4003.3, such a showing of substantial need and undue hardship will not be required. Note, however, that under Rule 4003.5(a)(3), governing discovery of opinions of an expert who is not expected to be called as a witness at trial, a showing of exceptional circumstances under which it is impracticable to obtain facts or opinions on the subject matter by other means is required.

   The federal draftsmen have justified the special showing of need on the ground that ‘‘each side’s informal evaluation of its case should be protected, that each side should be encouraged to prepare independently, and that one side should not automatically have the benefit of the detailed preparatory work of the other side.’’ The Committee, after long and careful deliberation, rejected this view which would impose more court time on lawyers and additional burdens on judges in the motion court. At the same time it also rejected a proposal to go to the opposite extreme and direct the mandatory exchange of all pretrial material, statements, medical reports and experts’ reports under penalty of sanctions.

   Second, the work product protection of the Rule distinguishes between that afforded the attorney and that afforded the party’s representative. They are on an equal footing under the Federal Rules. The Committee viewed the work product privilege enunciated by the United States Supreme Court in Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 67 S.Ct. 385, 91 L.Ed. 451 (1947), as stating a special rule applicable to lawyers which need not necessarily be the same as that applied to other representatives, particularly insurance investigators. Under the Rule, a lawyer’s notes or memoranda of an oral interview of a witness, who signs no written statement, are protected but the same notes or memoranda made by an insurance investigator will not be protected. A signed statement of the witness is, of course, always discoverable, no matter who took it or where it is filed.

Rule 4003.4. Scope of Discovery. Trial Preparation Material. Statements.
 Upon written request, a party is entitled to immediate receipt of a photostatic copy or like reproduction of a statement concerning the action or its subject matter previously made by that party, any other party or a witness. Upon written request, a person not a party is entitled to immediate receipt of a photostatic copy or like reproduction of a statement concerning the action or its subject matter previously made by that person. If the statement is not so provided, the party or person may move for a court order. For purposes of this rule, a statement previously made is

   (1)  a written statement signed or otherwise adopted or approved by the person making it, or

   (2)  a stenographic, mechanical, electrical or other recording, or a transcription thereof, which is a substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement by the person making it and contemporaneously recorded.

Explanatory Note
   Rule 4003.4 resolves a problem not covered in the prior practice, and which has troubled the courts. It provides that any party may, upon request, obtain from his opponent a copy of the party’s own statement or the statement of any witness in the possession of the opponent. Further, any witness may obtain a copy of his own statement upon request. If refused, the party or witness may move for a court order for compliance.

   The Rule differs markedly in scope from Fed. R.Civ.P. 26(b)(3). The Federal Rule permits a party to obtain only his own statement; the production of statements of witnesses obtained by an adverse party in anticipation of litigation or preparation for trial requires a showing of substantial need in the preparation of the inquiring party’s case and that he is unable without undue hardship to obtain a substantial equivalent of the materials by other means.

   There are no restrictions on the timing of the request. Under prior practice, some lower courts ruled that the statement of a party given to his opponent could be withheld until after the party had testified. Others held that the party could demand a copy of his statement before he testified. Some held that no witness could have a copy of his own statement because this would prevent a test of his veracity.

   The amended Rule does not deal with the substantive problem of admissibility in evidence or use of the statements. Their admissibility is governed by the rules of evidence.

   Two statutes are relevant. Section 7101 of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. §  7101, prohibits the use of statements obtained from an injured person within fifteen days of admission to a hospital or sanitarium, unless he acknowledges before an independent notary public his willingness to give the statement.

   Likewise, the Peer Review Protection Act of 1974, 63 P. S. §  425.1 et seq., imposes restrictions on discovery and use of the proceedings and records of health care peer review organizations for the purpose of evaluating the quality of health care.

   The Rule covers all forms of statements, including signed statements, recordings and transcriptions.

Rule 4003.5. Discovery of Expert Testimony. Trial Preparation Material.
 (a)  Discovery of facts known and opinions held by an expert, otherwise discoverable under the provisions of Rule 4003.1 and acquired or developed in anticipation of litigation or for trial, may be obtained as follows:

   (1)  A party may through interrogatories require

     (A)   any other party to identify each person whom the other party expects to call as an expert witness at trial and to state the subject matter on which the expert is expected to testify and

     (B)   subject to the provisions of subdivision (a)(4), the other party to have each expert so identified state the substance of the facts and opinions to which the expert is expected to testify and a summary of the grounds for each opinion. The party answering the interrogatories may file as his or her answer a report of the expert or have the interrogatories answered by the expert. The answer or separate report shall be signed by the expert.

   (2)  Upon cause shown, the court may order further discovery by other means, subject to

     (A)   such restrictions as to scope and such provisions concerning fees and expenses as the court may deem appropriate, and

     (B)   the provisions of subdivision (a)(4) of this rule.

   (3)  A party may not discover facts known or opinions held by an expert who has been retained or specially employed by another party in anticipation of litigation or preparation for trial and who is not expected to be called as a witness at trial, except a medical expert as provided in Rule 4010(b) or except on order of court as to any other expert upon a showing of exceptional circumstances under which it is impracticable for the party seeking discovery to obtain facts or opinions on the same subject by other means, subject to such restrictions as to scope and such provisions concerning fees and expenses as the court may deem appropriate.

   Official Note

   For additional provisions governing the production of expert reports in medical professional liability actions, see Rule 1042.26 et seq. Nothing in Rule 1042.26 et seq. precludes the entry of a court order under this rule.

   (4)  A party may not discover the communications between another party’s attorney and any expert who is to be identified pursuant to subdivision (a)(1)(A) or from whom discovery is permitted under subdivision (a)(3) regardless of the form of the communications, except in circumstances that would warrant the disclosure of privileged communications under Pennsylvania law. This provision protects from discovery draft expert reports and any communications between another party’s attorney and experts relating to such drafts.

 (b)  An expert witness whose identity is not disclosed in compliance with subdivision (a)(1) of this rule shall not be permitted to testify on behalf of the defaulting party at the trial of the action. However, if the failure to disclose the identity of the witness is the result of extenuating circumstances beyond the control of the defaulting party, the court may grant a continuance or other appropriate relief.

 (c)  To the extent that the facts known or opinions held by an expert have been developed in discovery proceedings under subdivision (a)(1) or (2) of this rule, the direct testimony of the expert at the trial may not be inconsistent with or go beyond the fair scope of his or her testimony in the discovery proceedings as set forth in the deposition, answer to an interrogatory, separate report or supplement thereto. However, the expert shall not be prevented from testifying as to facts or opinions on matters on which the expert has not been interrogated in the discovery proceedings.

Explanatory Note
   Rule 4011(f), which had protected a deponent, whether or not a party, from giving an opinion as an expert witness over his objection, has been rescinded. Discovery of these matters is now permitted by Rule 4003.5, which closely parallels Fed. R.Civ.P. 26(b)(4).

   The Rule distinguishes carefully between an expert expected to be called as a witness and an expert not expected to be called.

   With respect to the expert expected to be called, discovery of facts known and opinions held by him, acquired or developed in anticipation of litigation or for trial, may be obtained as follows:

   (1) First, the inquirer can by interrogatories require his opponent to disclose the identity of expert witnesses he expects to call at trial. The opponent must not only identify such experts but also state the subject matter on which each is expected to testify.

   If a party, in his answer to interrogatories, states that he has not yet retained his experts, he is under a duty to supplement his answer as provided by Rule 4007.4(1). In addition, the inquirer may obtain a stipulation that the party will supplement his response or ask the court for an order under Rule 4007.4(3) requiring the party to file a supplemental response when such experts are retained.

   (2) In addition, the inquirer can require each expert to be called at the trial whose identity is disclosed to state the substance of the facts and opinion to which he will testify, and a summary of the grounds for his opinion. The answering party has the option of having the expert answer the interrogatories himself on this issue or prepare a separate report which the answering party may attach to his answers. The answer or separate report must be signed by the expert.

   (3) If the answering party or the expert does not fully comply with the foregoing, the court under subdivision (b) or (c) may exclude or limit the testimony of such expert if offered at the trial. Sanction Rule 4019(i) also provides an independent sanction, excluding the testimony of a witness whose identity has not been revealed, unless the trial court determines there are extenuating circumstances beyond the control of the defaulting party.

   (4) Supplemental oral questioning of the expert may be permitted only upon cause shown, and upon payment of such fees and expenses as the court may fix. The Rule specifically provides no fees and expenses to the expert for the time spent in preparing answers to interrogatories or his report. He will be entitled to fees and expenses only if the inquirer seeks further oral discovery after the answer or report has been filed.

   (5) It should be emphasized that Rule 4003.5 is not applicable to discovery and deposition procedure where a defendant is himself an expert, such as a physician, architect or other professional person, and the alleged improper exercise of his professional skills is involved in the action. Such a defendant can be examined by written interrogatories under Rule 4005 or by oral deposition under Rule 4007.1. If so examined, a defendant cannot assert that his opinion may not be discovered without his consent.

   (6) To prevent incomplete or ‘‘fudging’’ of reports which would fail to reveal fully the facts and opinions of the expert or his grounds therefor, subdivision (c) provides that an expert’s direct testimony at the trial may not be inconsistent with or go beyond the fair scope of his testimony as set forth in his deposition and answer to interrogatories, separate report or supplements thereto. However, he may testify to anything regarding matters in which he was never questioned in the discovery proceedings. This is a new provision not expressly found in the Federal Rule. It is implicit in the Federal Rule.

   Where the full scope of the expert’s testimony is presented in the answer to interrogatories or the separate report, as provided in subdivisions (a)(1) and (2), this will fix the permissible limits of his testimony at the trial. But, if the inquirer limits his inquiry to one or more specific issues only, the expert is free to testify at trial as to any other relevant issues not included in the discovery. Therefore, what happens at the trial may depend upon the manner in which the expert is interrogated. The inquirer may be well advised to conduct his discovery broadly, by paraphrasing the language of 4003.5(a), which will require the expert to state all his opinions and grounds, thus preventing surprise testimony at trial concerning grounds never raised during the discovery.

   All of the foregoing discussion relates to the expert expected to be called at the trial.

   If the expert is not expected to be called at the trial, the situation is quite different. The special procedures listed above will not be applicable. Under subdivision (a)(3) of the Rule, no discovery of such a witness is permitted, except discovery of a medical expert under Rule 4010(b) infra, unless there is an order of court. To obtain this order of court, the inquirer must prove ‘‘exceptional circumstances’’ under which there is no practical way to find the facts or opinions by some other means.

   Therefore, even if the inquirer knows the name of this expert, or knows that there is a report, he is forbidden to seek discovery of facts known or opinions held, unless he convinces the court that he must have the discovery. This is a heavy burden, which explains the small use of this provision under the Federal Rule. We can anticipate an equally small use in Pennsylvania.

   One instance would be where an object is given by a plaintiff to an expert for the defendant for testing and is destroyed in the testing. Then, if the defendant elects not to call that expert at the trial, the plaintiff must get his testimony since the object is destroyed.

   The Rule provides no special procedures in this instance. It is anticipated that ordinary discovery will suffice. If the inquirer does not know the name of the expert, he can ask for it by conventional interrogatory or oral deposition. If he knows there is a report, he can ask for it under Rule 4009.

   Another difference is that the court may require the inquirer to pay the expert for his fees and expenses in the discovery. In the case of the expert who is expected to be called at the trial, there is no such provision in subsections (a)(1) and (2).

   The Rule says nothing about the rare situation when the inquirer is an indigent party and cannot pay the expenses of the expert. Any such situation will have to be handled by the courts ad hoc, under the general principles of litigation in forma pauperis.

   This subdivision is not intended, as pointed out by the federal draftsmen, to permit discovery of experts who may have been informally consulted by a party. Finally, it applies only to experts ‘‘retained or specially employed.’’ A regular employe of a party who may have collected facts, prepared reports and rendered opinions, and who may be qualified as an expert, is not covered by this sub-section and has no immunity from discovery, simply because the party elects not to call him at the trial. He is not an ‘‘expert’’ within the meaning of the Rule; he is simply a witness, an employe of a party.

Rule 4004. Procedure on Depositions by Written Interrogatories.
 (a)(1)  A party taking a deposition by written interrogatories shall serve a copy of the interrogatories upon each party or the attorney of record of each party. Within thirty days thereafter the party so served may serve cross interrogatories upon each party or the attorney of record of each party. Subsequent interrogatories shall be similarly served within ten days.

   (2)  The interrogatories shall contain a notice stating the name or descriptive title and address of the officer before whom the deposition is to be taken, the time and place of taking the deposition and the name and address of each person to be examined if known, and, if the name is not known, a general description sufficient to identify each person to be examined or the particular class or group to which each person belongs. A deposition upon written interrogatories may be taken of a public or private corporation or a partnership or association or governmental agency in accordance with the provisions of Rule 4007.1(e).

 (b)  Objections to the form of interrogatories are waived unless filed and served upon the party propounding them within the time allowed for serving the succeeding cross or other interrogatories or within ten days after service of the last interrogatories. All other objections may be made at the trial except as otherwise provided by Rule 4016.

 (c)  A copy of all interrogatories for the taking of a deposition shall be transmitted to the person designated to take the deposition, who shall promptly give notice to the witness and thereafter propound the interrogatories to the witness and complete, certify and send the deposition by registered mail to the party taking the deposition, attaching thereto the copy of the interrogatories.

 (d)  When the deposition is received by the party taking the deposition, the party shall promptly give notice thereof to all other parties.

 (e)  After the service of interrogatories and prior to the taking of the testimony of the deponent, the court in which the action is pending, on motion promptly made by a party or a deponent, may make an order in accordance with Rule 4012, or an order that the deposition shall not be taken before the officer designated in the notice, or that it not be taken except upon oral examination.

Explanatory Note
   The amendments make two major changes in the prior practice. First, in subdivision (a) the time period for filing cross-interrogatories is extended from ten days to thirty days and the time period for filing redirect interrogatories is extended from five days to ten days. These time periods follow the Federal Rules. In subdivision (b) the time period for filing objections to the form of interrogatories is extended from five days to ten days.

   Second, subdivision (a) is further amended by adding a new subparagraph (2) providing for a notice identifying the officer, the time and place, and the name and address of each witness. If a name is unknown, it is sufficient to identify the witness or the particular class or group to which he belongs. This was previously permitted only as to notice of oral depositions under Rule 4007(c) and written interrogatories to a party under Rule 4005(a). It was not permitted as to written interrogatories to a witness under Rule 4004.

   This new subparagraph (2) also incorporates by reference the provisions of new Rule 4007.1(e). This follows Fed. R.Civ.P. 30(b)(6) and 31(a) and permits a party to name a corporation, partnership, association, or governmental agency as the deponent and to designate the matter on which the opponent requests examination. The organization is then required to name one or more of its officers, directors, or managing agents, or other person who consents to appear as the person to be examined. If a person who has knowledge of the facts is not an officer, director or managing agent but is an employe and he refuses his consent, discovery may be used to ascertain his identity and he may thereafter be subpoenaed to appear.

   As stated by the draftsmen of the amendments to the Federal Rules, these provisions reduce the difficulties previously encountered in determining, prior to the submission of written interrogatories or the taking of a deposition, the identity of the proper person to testify. The provision will avoid the necessity of deposing large numbers of officers, directors, agents or others, only to find in turn that they have no knowledge, or incomplete knowledge, of the information sought.

   Present subdivisions (c), (d) and (e) of this Rule remain unchanged.

Rule 4005. Written Interrogatories to a Party.
 (a)  Subject to the limitations provided by Rule 4011, any party may serve upon any other party written interrogatories to be answered by the party served or, if the party served is a public or private corporation or similar entity or a partnership or association, by any officer or agent, who shall furnish such information as is available to the party. Interrogatories may be served upon any party at the time of service of the original process or at any time thereafter. Interrogatories which are to be served prior to service of the complaint shall be limited to the purpose of preparing a complaint and shall contain a brief statement of the nature of the cause of action. Interrogatories shall be prepared in such fashion that sufficient space is provided immediately after each interrogatory or subsection thereof for insertion of the answer or objection.

   Official Note

   Rule 440 requires the party serving interrogatories upon any other party to serve a copy upon every party to the action.

   Interrogatories that generally require the responding party to state the basis of particular claims, defenses or contentions made in pleadings or other documents should be used sparingly and, if used, should be designed to target claims, defenses or contentions that the propounding attorney reasonably suspects may be the proper subjects of early dismissal or resolution or, alternatively, to identify and to narrow the scope of claims, defenses and contentions made where the scope is unclear.

   See Rule 4003.8 governing pre-complaint discovery.

 (b)  Rescinded.

   Official Note

   The subject matter governed by former Rule 4005(b) has been transferred to Rule 4006(a).

 (c)  Interrogatories may relate to any matters which can be inquired into under Rules 4003.1 through 4003.5 inclusive and the answers may be used to the same extent as provided in Rule 4020 for the use of the deposition of a party. Interrogatories may be served after a deposition has been taken, and a deposition may be taken after interrogatories have been answered, but the court, on motion of the party interrogated, may make such protective order as justice requires. The number of interrogatories or of sets of interrogatories to be served may be limited as justice requires to protect the party from unreasonable annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, burden or expense.

Explanatory Note
   The amendments to Rule 4005 make a number of stylistic changes, and three important changes of substance.

   First, the word ‘‘adverse’’ has been deleted to permit interrogatories to be addressed to any other party to the action, whether or not adverse to the inquiring party. This is the same change which was made in Fed. R. Civ.P. 33 in 1970. The amendment clarifies the right to file interrogatories to additional defendants or co-defendants. Some lower court decisions held that additional defendants were not adverse parties and that interrogatories must be addressed to them as witnesses. Similarly, an additional defendant could not be compelled to respond to requests for admission under Rule 4014 since that likewise was restricted to adverse parties.

   In a marked departure from the prior practice, amended Rules 4005 and 4006 require that the interrogatories and the answers thereto be contained in one document, with the answer immediately following the interrogatory to which it is responsive. Rule 4005 requires the inquiring party to leave sufficient space after each interrogatory for insertion of the answer. The original and two copies are served upon the answering party. The original is not filed until the answers have been inserted and the document signed and verified as provided by Rule 4006. It is recognized that in some cases it will be difficult to estimate the amount of space required for an answer. Rule 4006 provides that the answering party may continue his answer to an individual interrogatory on a supplemental sheet, identifying the number of the interrogatory to which it is responsive. Of course, the answering party may desire, as a matter of style, to retype the page rather than attach a supplemental sheet.

   The time restriction in the former Rule, requiring leave of court if the interrogatories are to be served within 20 days of the commencement of the action, has been eliminated. Interrogatories may be filed with the complaint or writ or at any time thereafter.

   Finally, the last sentence of subdivision (c), which does not appear in Fed. R. Civ.P. 33(b), permits the court to order a limitation upon the number of interrogatories or sets of interrogatories as justice requires to protect a party from unreasonable annoyance, expense, embarrassment or oppression. It is adapted from prior Rule 4005(c). Suggestions that the Rule specifically fix the number of interrogatories which can be submitted without leave of court was considered and rejected in favor of a more flexible limitation.

Explanatory Note—2008
   Civil Discovery Standard No. 8 of the American Bar Association (2004) establishes a guideline for the use of contention interrogatories. This standard has been added as a note to Rule 4003.1(c) governing discovery of opinions and contentions and as the second paragraph to the present note to Rule 4005(a) governing written interrogatories to a party.

   The rationale for the proposal is succinctly set forth in the Comment to Civil Discovery Standard No. 8:

   * * * Contention interrogatories, like all forms of discovery, can be susceptible to abuse. Among other things, they can be used as an attempt to tie up the opposing party rather than to obtain discovery. The legitimate purpose of contention interrogatories is to narrow the issues for trial, not to force the opposing side to marshal all its evidence on paper. * * *

   The potential for overreaching is particularly present when interrogatories seeking the detailed underpinnings of the opposing party’s allegations are served early in the case. Although, when used with discretion, interrogatories served near the outset of the case can be useful in narrowing the issues to define the scope of necessary discovery, contention interrogatories ordinarily are more appropriate after the bulk of discovery has already taken place. At that point, the party on whom the interrogatories are served should have the information necessary to give specific, useful responses. [Citations omitted.]

Rule 4006. Answers to Written Interrogatories by a Party.
 (a)(1)  Answers to interrogatories shall be in writing and verified. The answers shall be inserted in the spaces provided in the interrogatories. If there is insufficient space to answer an interrogatory, the remainder of the answer shall follow on a supplemental sheet.

   (2)  Each interrogatory shall be answered fully and completely unless objected to, in which event the reasons for the objection shall be stated in lieu of an answer. The answers shall be signed by the person making them, and the objections shall be signed by the attorney making them. The statement of an objection shall not excuse the answering party from answering all remaining interrogatories to which no objection is stated. The answering party shall serve a copy of the answers, and objections if any, within thirty days after the service of the interrogatories. The party submitting the interrogatories may move the court to dismiss an objection and direct that the interrogatory be answered.

   Official Note

   Rule 440 requires the answering party to serve a copy of the answers upon every party to the action.

   (3)  [Rescinded].

   Official Note

   See Rule 4003.1 for the general scope of discovery.

 (b)  Where the answer to an interrogatory may be derived or ascertained from the records of the party upon whom the interrogatory has been served or from an examination, audit or inspection of that party’s records, or from a compilation, abstract or summary based thereon, and the burden of deriving or ascertaining the answer would be substantially the same for the party serving the interrogatory as for the party served, a sufficient answer to such an interrogatory shall be to specify the records from which the answer may be derived or ascertained and to afford the party serving the interrogatory reasonable opportunity to examine, audit or inspect those records and to obtain copies, compilations, abstracts or summaries.

Explanatory Note
   The prior Rule has been completely rewritten to incorporate substantial parts of Fed. R. Civ.P. 33 and to conform to Rule 4005.

   (1) The restriction in the prior Rule to ‘‘adverse’’ parties is deleted.

   (2) The answering party will respond to each interrogatory in the space provided. If the space is inadequate, he may retype the interrogatories or he may use a supplemental sheet for the remainder of his response.

   (3) The amendment requires the answering person to sign the answer and the attorney to sign any objections. This follows Fed. R. Civ.P. 33. Present practice provides only for signing the answer.

   (4) An interrogatory which is otherwise proper is not objectionable because the answer will require an opinion or the application of law to fact. This conforms to Fed. R. Civ.P. 33(b) and the rescission of former Rule 4011(f).

   (5) Subdivision (b) copies Fed. R. Civ.P. 33(c) by providing that, where the requested information may be derived or ascertained from a party’s records, he has an option to produce the records for inspection by the inquiring party rather than detailing the information in his answer.

   The amendment, however, goes beyond Fed. R. Civ.P. 33(c) by making the option applicable to all records. The Federal Rule restricts the option to ‘‘business’’ records. This expansion of the option to all records is not intended to give an answering party carte blanche to foist upon the inquiring party a jumble of personal records. The option can be used only where the burden would be substantially the same for both parties and never where it will be an undue burden on the inquiring party. The amendment also goes beyond the Federal Rule in requiring the inquiring party who has made compilations, abstracts or summaries from the records to furnish a copy to the party who has produced the records. This will help facilitate agreements as to their accuracy for use at trial and prevent surprise.

   (6) The time periods for answer are extended to 30 days after service of the interrogatories to conform to the time period of the Federal Rule.

   (7) Under the amendment, as under the Federal Rule, the statement of an objection will not excuse the answering party from answering all remaining interrogatories to which no objection is stated.

Rule 4007.1. Procedure in Deposition by Oral Examination.
 (a)  General Rule. A party desiring to take the deposition of any person upon oral examination shall give reasonable notice in writing to every other party to the action, except that no notice need be given a defendant who was served by publication and has not appeared in the action. A party noticed to be deposed shall be required to appear without subpoena.

 (b)  General Notice Requirements. The notice shall:

   (1)  conform with the requirements of subdivision (c) of this rule and Rule 4007.2(b) and (c), if appropriate;

   (2)  state the time and place of taking the deposition; and

   (3)  state the name and address of each person to be examined if known, or, if the name is not known, a general description sufficient to identify the deponent or the particular class or group to which the deponent belongs.

 (c)  Notice Requirements for Deposition in Pre-Complaint Discovery. The purpose of the deposition and matters to be inquired into need not be stated in the notice unless the action has been commenced by writ of summons and the plaintiff desires to take the deposition of any person upon oral examination for the purpose of preparing a complaint. In such case, the notice shall include a brief statement of the nature of the cause of action and of the matters to be inquired into.

 (d)  Additional Notice Requirements on Party or Witness.

   (1)  If the person to be examined is a party, the notice may include a request made in compliance with Rule 4009.1 et seq., for the production of documents and tangible things at the taking of the deposition.

   (2)  If the person to be examined is not a party, and is to be served with a subpoena duces tecum to produce designated materials, the notice shall specify the materials to be produced. The materials shall be produced at the deposition and not earlier, except upon the consent of all parties to the action.

 (e)  Notice to Public or Private Corporations, Partnerships, Associations, or Governmental Agencies.

   (1)  In the notice or an issued subpoena, a party may:

     (i)   name as the deponent a public or private corporation, a partnership, an association, or a governmental agency; and

     (ii)   describe with reasonable particularity the matters to be inquired into and the materials to be produced.

   (2)  Any organization named pursuant to subdivision (e)(1)(i):

     (i)   shall serve a designation of one or more officers, directors, managing agents, or other persons who consent to testify on its behalf; and

     (ii)   may set forth for each designated person the matters on which each person will testify.

   (3)  A subpoena shall advise a non-party organization of its duty to make such a designation. The designated person or persons shall testify as to matters known or reasonably available to the organization.

   (4)  Subdivision (e) does not preclude taking a deposition by any other procedure authorized in these rules.

Comment:
   Regarding subdivision (b), the court upon cause shown may make a protective order with respect to the time and place of taking the deposition. See Pa.R.Civ.P. 4012.

   Regarding subdivision (c), see Pa.R.Civ.P. 4003.8 governing pre-complaint discovery.

Historical Commentary
   The following commentary is historical in nature and represents statements of the Committee at the time of rulemaking:

Explanatory Comment—1978
   Former Rule 4007 has been rescinded. The subject matter of former subdivision (a), dealing with the scope of discovery, has been enlarged and transposed to Rule 4003.1, supra. The provisions of former subdivision (b), dealing with the requirement of leave of court, have been transposed to Rule 4007.2. The provisions of former subdivision (c), dealing with notice, are enlarged in Rule 4007.1. The provisions of former subdivision (d)(1), authorizing local option rules for the content of the notice, are deleted and all local rules under former subdivision (d) will be invalid. The provisions of former subdivision (d)(2) for the filing of objections are deleted. A protective order under Rule 4012 is available.

   In place of former Rule 4007 are new Rule 4007.1, which prescribes the procedure in deposition by oral examination, Rule 4007.2, which prescribes when leave of court is required, and Rules 4007.3 and 4007.4, which govern the sequence and timing of discovery and supplementary responses, subjects not previously governed by the Rules. These new Rules will be commented on separately.

   Subdivisions (a) and (b) repeat the substance of former Rule 4007(c). A provision has been added to make it clear that a party noticed to be deposed need not be subpoenaed. The notice is sufficient to support subsequent sanction procedures under Rule 4019 for failure to appear.

   Subdivision (c) is new. It provides that the purpose of the deposition and the matters to be inquired into need not be stated in the notice, except in the relatively infrequent case where the action has been commenced by a writ of summons and the plaintiff desires to take a deposition upon oral examination for the purpose of preparing a complaint. In this situation the inquirer must provide a brief statement of the nature of the cause of action and of the matters to be inquired into. The reason for the Rule is obvious. The party who has not yet been served with a complaint may in some instances not be aware of the nature of the action and thus be totally unprepared to submit to oral examination.

   Subdivision (d) clarifies the practice for the production of documents in connection with an oral deposition. Under it, a simple request to a party to produce documents is sufficient. No subpoena is needed. But if the person examined is a witness and not a party, a subpoena duces tecum to produce specified materials and documents must be served.

   Subdivision (e) is adapted, almost verbatim, from Fed.R.Civ.P. 30(b)(6). It provides, as an optional alternative to other forms of discovery, that the notice may name as a deponent a public or private corporation or a partnership or association or governmental agency. In this situation, however, the notice must describe with reasonable particularity the matters to be inquired into and the materials to be produced. The organization, if it is a party, is then required to serve on the inquirer a designation of the officers, directors, managing agents or other persons who will testify on its behalf. The purpose of the Rule is to avoid the wholesale subpoenaing of named directors, officers, and others where the inquirer does not know the identity of the exact person or persons who will be able to testify as to the requested information.

   If it develops that the designated persons reveal others whose testimony may be relevant, they can also be deposed. The procedure is not exclusive and the inquirer may resort to any other method of discovery and subpoena available.

   The reference to the ‘‘consent to testify’’ is limited to persons other than officers, directors or managing agents. The latter may not frustrate the discovery by declining to testify; their position requires them to testify. A subordinate employe is not in the same position and the organization cannot designate such a subordinate employe unless it certifies that he will testify.

Explanatory Comment—1998
   Section 5326 of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. §  5326, relating to ‘‘Assistance to tribunals and litigants outside this Commonwealth with respect to depositions’’ provides:

   

  (a) General Rule.—A court of record of this Commonwealth may order a person who is domiciled or is found within this Commonwealth to give his testimony or statement or to produce documents or other things for use in a matter pending in a tribunal outside this Commonwealth. . . .

   New subdivision (f) of Rule 4007.1 responds to the concern that there should be a limitation upon the county from which an order may be sought so that the person who is the subject of the order is not put to unreasonable expense or burden. A resident of Erie should not have to travel to Easton to object to an order obtained in connection with litigation outside the Commonwealth.

Rule 4007.2. When Leave of Court Required.
 (a)  Except as provided by Rules 1042.5 and 4003.5(a)(2) and by subdivisions (b) and (d) of this rule, a deposition may be taken without leave of court.

   Official Note

   Rule 1042.5 governs discovery in a professional liability action prior to the filing of a certificate of merit.

   See Rule 1930.5(a) providing that there shall be no discovery in specified domestic relations matters unless authorized by the court. See also Rules 1910.9 and 1915.5(c) governing discovery in actions for support and custody, respectively.

 (b)  Leave of court must be obtained if a plaintiff’s notice schedules the taking of a deposition prior to the expiration of thirty days after service of the original process and the defendant has not served a notice of taking a deposition or otherwise sought discovery, unless the party or person to be examined is

   (1)  aged or infirm, or

   (2)  about to leave the county in which the action is pending for a place outside the Commonwealth or a place more than one hundred miles from the courthouse in which the action is pending.

 (c)  If the plaintiff proceeds under subdivision (b)(1) or (2) of this rule the notice of taking the deposition shall set forth the facts which support taking it without leave of court. The plaintiff’s attorney shall sign the notice and this signature shall constitute a certification that to the best of the attorney’s knowledge, information and belief the statement of facts is true.

   Official Note

   The court upon cause shown may make a protective order with respect to the time and place of taking the deposition. See Rule 4012.

 (d)  The deposition of a person confined in prison may be taken only by leave of court on such terms as the court prescribes.

Explanatory Note
   This Rule consolidates in one Rule various provisions for leave of court which are now scattered through the prior Rules. It substantially follows present practice.

   Rule 4003.5(a)(2), incorporated by reference, requires leave of court for further examination of experts whose opinions or reports have already been disclosed in response to the interrogatories.

   Leave of court will also be required, under subdivision (d), to take the deposition of a person confined in prison. This follows the practice under prior Rule 4007(b).

   Subdivision (b) states a general rule that leave of court is required where a plaintiff seeks to take an oral deposition prior to the expiration of 30 days after service of original process, if the defendant has not within such period sought discovery or noticed a deposition of his own. This is adapted from prior Rule 4007(b) with an extension of the time from 20 to 30 days.

   However, subdivision (b) contains a special exception for aged, infirm or going witnesses. This was not in prior Rule 4007. No leave of court is required if the plaintiff’s notice to take the deposition sets forth the facts respecting the witness and the notice is signed by the plaintiff’s attorney. This constitutes a certification by him that the statement is true to the best of his knowledge, information and belief. The court, however, upon cause shown may under Rule 4012, on motion of an objecting party, enter a protective order changing the time or place.

Explanatory Note—1999
   Rule 4007.2(a) has been amended to delete the reference to Rule 4001(a). Rule 4001(a) was amended in 1997 by the deletion of the reference to domestic relations actions, the rules of which formerly contained a broad prohibition against discovery except upon leave of court. That broad prohibition has now been narrowed and discovery is available to the extent provided by Rule 1930.5 governing discovery in domestic relations matters generally and Rules 1910.9 and 1915.5 governing discovery in the actions of support and custody, respectively. At the same time, those rules continue to require leave of court in specified instances.

Immediately preceding text appears at serial pages (255403) to (255405).

Rule 4007.3. Sequence and Timing of Discovery.
 Unless the court upon motion, for the convenience of parties and witnesses and in the interests of justice, orders otherwise, methods of discovery may be used in any sequence and the fact that a party is conducting discovery, whether by deposition or otherwise, shall not operate to delay any other party’s discovery.

Explanatory Note
   Neither the Federal Rules, prior to their amendment in 1970, nor prior Rule 4007 dealt with this subject. Some courts held that a party who first gave notice obtained a priority which would prevent depositions or discovery by other parties until the first party had completed his own depositions and discovery. This led to a ‘‘race to the courthouse.’’ The proposed Rule, which is taken almost verbatim from Fed. R.Civ.P. 26(d), is designed to reverse these decisions.

   In principle, a party first initiating discovery gets no priority whatever. Nothing prevents other parties from proceeding simultaneously with their discovery.

   Further, all methods of discovery may be used in any sequence; for example, interrogatories may precede oral depositions, or oral depositions may be followed by interrogatories or requests for admissions or requests for production of documents.

   All this, however, is subject to the control of the court, which may enter special orders ‘‘for the convenience of parties and witnesses and in the interest of justice.’’

   The provisions of this Rule 4007.3 adopted November 20, 1978, effective April 16, 1979, 8 Pa.B. 3551.

Rule 4007.4. Supplementing Responses.
 A party or an expert witness who has responded to a request for discovery with a response that was complete when made is under no duty to supplement the response to include information thereafter acquired, except as follows:

   (1)  A party is under a duty seasonably to supplement the response with respect to any question directly addressed to the identity and location of persons having knowledge of discoverable matters and the identity of each person expected to be called as an expert witness at trial, the subject matter on which each person is expected to testify and the substance of each person’s testimony as provided in Rule 4003.5(a)(1).

   (2)  A party or an expert witness is under a duty seasonably to amend a prior response if he or she obtains information upon the basis of which he or she knows

     (i)   the response was incorrect when made, or

     (ii)   the response though correct when made is no longer true.

   (3)  A duty to supplement responses may be imposed by order of the court, agreement of the parties, or at any time prior to trial through new requests to supplement prior responses.

Explanatory Note
   The prior Rules contained no provisions imposing any continuing obligation on an answering party to supplement his responses to interrogatories or oral depositions if he becomes aware of subsequent facts which make his prior answers incorrect when made or no longer true in the light of new circumstances.

   Rule 4007.4 is adapted from Fed. R.Civ.P. 26(e) to provide such an automatic obligation. The automatic obligation is limited to (a) disclosure by a party of the identity and location of additional persons having knowledge of discoverable facts and the identity of persons expected to be called at trial as expert witnesses, and (b) amendment of a prior answer if a party or expert witness obtains information on the basis of which he knows that the original response was incorrect, or, if correct when originally made, is no longer true. Additional obligations to supplement may be imposed by (1) an order of court; or (2) an agreement of the parties; or (3) supplemental interrogatories.

   Fed. R.Civ.P. 26(e) has not been adopted verbatim. It restricts the duty to cases where ‘‘the circumstances are such that a failure to amend the response is in substance a knowing concealment.’’ This limitation has been rejected. It would introduce collateral issues. The test in new Rule 4007.4 is whether the party or the expert witness knows that the response was incorrect or is no longer correct in the light of intervening events of which he has knowledge. If he knows this, he must correct the response. If he does not know it, he need do nothing. Whether a failure to correct it is a ‘‘knowing concealment’’ introduces a different issue.

   The Rule operates in several different ways as a practical matter.

   First, it is quite common, when an oral deposition is complete, for the inquirer to request, and obtain, an agreement from the opponent or from an expert witness to supplement the response within the scope of the Rule. This also can be accomplished by appropriate closing questions in interrogatories.

   Second, the inquirer, if such an agreement is refused, may move the court to enter an appropriate order.

   Third, the inquirer may, at any time, force a review of prior responses by filing supplementary interrogatories or noticing a supplementary oral examination to discover whether the respondent has become aware of any information which requires an amendment of any prior response.

   The Rule also expands the Federal Rule by including ‘‘a party or an expert witness’’; the Federal Rule includes ‘‘a party’’ only.

Rule 4008. Oral Examination. Limitation.
 If a deposition is to be taken by oral examination more than one hundred miles from the courthouse, the court upon motion may make an order requiring the payment of reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, as the court shall deem proper.

Explanatory Note
   This Rule remains unchanged.

   It applies only where a deposition is to be taken by oral examination more than 100 miles from the courthouse. It does not apply to other situations or to other forms of discovery. Other kinds of limitations are prescribed in Rule 4012, infra, which provides for protective orders in all forms of discovery, in Rule 4010(a) which provides for limitations of physical or mental examinations and Rule 4009(b)(2) which provides for objections to production of documents and things and entry for inspection.

GENERAL PROVISIONS


Explanatory Comment—Electronically Stored Information
   A. No Importation of Federal Law

   Though the term ‘‘electronically stored information’’ is used in these rules, there is no intent to incorporate the federal jurisprudence surrounding the discovery of electronically stored information. The treatment of such issues is to be determined by traditional principles of proportionality under Pennsylvania law as discussed in further detail below.

   B. Proportionality Standard

   As with all other discovery, electronically stored information is governed by a proportionality standard in order that discovery obligations are consistent with the just, speedy and inexpensive determination and resolution of litigation disputes. The proportionality standard requires the court, within the framework of the purpose of discovery of giving each party the opportunity to prepare its case, to consider: (i) the nature and scope of the litigation, including the importance and complexity of the issues and the amounts at stake; (ii) the relevance of electronically stored information and its importance to the court’s adjudication in the given case; (iii) the cost, burden, and delay that may be imposed on the parties to deal with electronically stored information; (iv) the ease of producing electronically stored information and whether substantially similar information is available with less burden; and (v) any other factors relevant under the circumstances.

   C. Tools for Addressing Electronically Stored Information

   Parties and courts may consider tools such as electronic searching, sampling, cost sharing, and non-waiver agreements to fairly allocate discovery burdens and costs. When utilizing non-waiver agreements, parties may wish to incorporate those agreements into court orders to maximize protection vis-[agrave]-vis third parties. See, e.g., Fed. R. Evid. 502(c).

   D. Eliminating References to ‘‘Depositions’’

   The elimination of specific references to ‘‘depositions’’ in Rule 4011 is not intended to exclude depositions from the scope of this rule. The reference was eliminated because there was no reason to call out this one form of traditional discovery among many.

Rule 4009.1. Production of Documents and Things. General Provisions.
 (a)  Any party may serve a request upon a party pursuant to Rules 4009.11 and 4009.12 or a subpoena upon a person not a party pursuant to Rules 4009.21 through 4009.27 to produce and permit the requesting party, or someone acting on the party’s behalf, to inspect and copy any designated documents (including writings, drawings, graphs, charts, photographs, and electronically stored information), or to inspect, copy, test or sample any tangible things or electronically stored information, which constitute or contain matters within the scope of Rules 4003.1 through 4003.6 inclusive and which are in the possession, custody or control of the party or person upon whom the request or subpoena is served, and may do so one or more times.

 (b)  A party requesting electronically stored information may specify the format in which it is to be produced and a responding party or person not a party may object. If no format is specified by the requesting party, electronically stored information may be produced in the form in which it is ordinarily maintained or in a reasonably usable form.

   Official Note

   These rules do not prevent a court from entering an order under its common law power preserving or protecting a document or thing.

   Parties to an action and persons not parties but served with a subpoena or request pursuant to these rules have the protective and enforcement provisions of the discovery rules available to them. See Rule 4012 governing protective orders and Rule 4019 governing enforcement and sanctions for failure to make discovery.

   The remedy of a protective order is available to the party to whom a request is directed to prevent abuse.

   These rules do not preclude (1) the issuance under Rule 234.1 et seq. of a subpoena or request for the production of documents or things at a deposition pursuant to Rule 4007.1(d) or (2) an independent action against a person not a party for production of documents or things.

   For additional provisions governing the production of expert reports in medical professional liability actions, see Rule 1042.26 et seq.

REQUEST UPON A PARTY

Rule 4009.11. Request Upon a Party for Production of Documents and Things.
 (a)  The request may be served without leave of court upon the plaintiff after commencement of the action and upon any other party with or after service of the original process upon that party.

 (b)  The request shall set forth in numbered paragraphs the items to be produced either by individual item or by category, and describe each item or category with reasonable particularity. Each paragraph shall seek only a single item or a single category of items. The request shall be prepared in such fashion that sufficient space is provided immediately after each paragraph for insertion of the answer.

   Official Note

   A request seeking electronically stored information should be as specific as possible. Limitations as to time and scope are favored, as are agreements between the parties on production formats and other issues.

   See also Rule 4009.1 generally regarding electronically stored information.

Rule 4009.12. Answer to Request Upon a Party for Production of Documents and Things.
 (a)  The party upon whom the request is served shall within thirty days after the service of the request

   (1)  serve an answer including objections to each numbered paragraph in the request, and

   (2)  produce or make available to the party submitting the request those documents and things described in the request to which there is no objection.

     (i)   Where the documents may be identified only after review of a larger group of documents, and the burden of identifying the documents would be substantially the same for the party serving the request as for the party served, the party served may afford the party serving the request reasonable opportunity to identify the documents, to examine or inspect them and to obtain copies.

 (b)  The answer shall be in the form of a paragraph-by-paragraph response which shall

   (1)  identify all documents or things produced or made available;

   (2)  identify all documents or things not produced or made available because of the objection that they are not within the scope of permissible discovery under Rule 4003.2 through Rule 4003.6 inclusive and Rule 4011(c). Documents or things not produced shall be identified with reasonable particularity together with the basis for non-production;

   (3)  specify a larger group of documents or things from which the documents or things to be produced or made available may be identified as provided by subdivision (a)(2)(i);

   (4)  object to the request on the grounds set forth in Rule 4011(a), (b), and (e) or on the ground that the request does not meet the requirements of Rule 4009.11;

   (5)  state that after reasonable investigation, it has been determined that there are no documents responsive to the request.

   Official Note

   The party who is requested to produce documents or things is encouraged to identify the documents or things produced and the documents or things withheld through a system of numbering. The party producing the documents and things and the party receiving them are encouraged to keep a current list of the documents and things produced and withheld based on the numbering system. This procedure will assist the court in resolving disputes arising out of production of documents.

   Ordinarily, each page of a document should receive a separate number. However, a document may be assigned a number as a whole if it is bound or if it contains pages which are sequentially numbered.

   The court may require numbering.

 (c)  The answer shall be signed and verified by the party making it and signed also by the attorney making an objection if one is set forth.

 (d)  If a request if reasonably susceptible to one construction under which documents sought to be produced are within the scope of the request and another construction under which the documents are outside the scope of the request, the answering party shall either produce the documents or identify with reasonable particularity the documents not produced together with the basis for non-production.

SUBPOENA UPON A PERSON NOT A PARTY

Rule 4009.21. Subpoena Upon a Person Not a Party for Production of Documents and Things. Prior Notice. Objections.
 (a)  A party seeking production from a person not a party to the action shall give written notice to every other party of the intent to serve a subpoena at least twenty days before the date of service. A copy of the subpoena proposed to be served shall be attached to the notice.

   Official Note

   For the form of the written notice, see Rule 4009.24(a).

   These rules do not preclude (1) the issuance under Rule 234.1 et. seq. of a subpoena or request for the production of documents or things at a deposition pursuant to Rule 4007.1(d) or (2) an independent action against a person not a party for production of documents or things.

 (b)  The written notice shall not be given to the person named in the subpoena.

 (c)  Any party may object to the subpoena by filing of record written objections and serving a copy of the objections upon every other party to the action.

   Official Note

   For the form of the objections, see Rule 4009.24(b).

   The requirement of filing with the prothonotary the objections under this rule and the certificate under Rule 4009.23(a) provides a more formal procedure for the participation of a person not a party in the discovery process.

 (d)(1)  If objections are received by the party intending to serve the subpoena prior to its service, the subpoena shall not be served. The court upon motion shall rule upon the objections and enter an appropriate order.

   Official Note

   Subdivision (a) of this rule provides a twenty-day notice period during which a subpoena may not be served.

   (2)  If objections are not received as provided in paragraph (1), the subpoena may be served subject to the right of any party or interested person to seek a protective order.

Rule 4009.22. Service of Subpoena.
 (a)  The party seeking production may serve on the person named in the subpoena a copy of the subpoena only if it is identical to the subpoena attached to the notice of intent to serve the subpoena and if the party seeking production has filed of record a certificate that

   (1)  the notice of intent to serve a subpoena was mailed or delivered to each party at least twenty days prior to the date on which the subpoena is sought to be served,

   (2)  a copy of the notice of intent, including the proposed subpoena attached to the notice of intent, is attached to the certificate,

   (3)  no objection to the subpoena has been received, and

   (4)  the subpoena which will be served is identical to the subpoena which is attached to the notice of intent to serve the subpoena.

   Official Note

   For the form of the certificate, see Rule 4009.25.

   The twenty-day advance notice is for the benefit of the parties and not the person served. The twenty-day notice period may be waived and the certificate modified accordingly.

 (b)  The subpoena shall be issued as provided by Rule 234.2(a) and shall be served in the manner provided by Rule 234.2(b).

Rule 4009.23. Certificate of Compliance by a Person Not a Party. Notice of Documents or Things Received.
 (a)  The person not a party upon whom the subpoena has been served shall, in complying with the subpoena, execute a certificate of compliance and deliver it with the documents or things produced to the party serving the subpoena within twenty days of service. A form of certificate to be executed and delivered shall be served with the subpoena.

   Official Note

   For the form of the certificate of compliance, see Rule 4009.27.

   The requirement of filing with the prothonotary the certificate under this rule and the objections under Rule 4009.21(c) provides a more formal procedure for the participation of a person not a party in the discovery process.

 (b)  The party receiving documents and things pursuant to the subpoena shall give notice of receipt to every other party to the action and upon the payment of reasonable cost shall

   (1)  furnish a legible copy of each document to any other party who requests a copy and

   (2)  allow reasonable access to the things to any other party who requests access.

ENTRY UPON PROPERTY FOR INSPECTION AND
OTHER ACTIVITIES

Rule 4009.31. Entry Upon Property for Inspection and Other Activities. General Provisions.
 Any party may serve a request upon a party pursuant to Rule 4009.32 or a motion upon a person not a party pursuant to Rule 4009.33 to permit entry upon designated property in the possession or control of the party or person upon whom the request is served for the purpose of inspecting and measuring, surveying, photographing, testing, or sampling the property or any designated object or operation thereon, within the scope of Rules 4003.1 through 4003.6 inclusive.

   Official Note

   These rules do not prevent a court from entering an order under its common law power preserving or protecting property.

   Parties to an action and persons not parties but served with a subpoena or request pursuant to these rules have the protective and enforcement provisions of the discovery rules available to them. See Rule 4012 governing protective orders and Rule 4019 governing enforcement and sanctions for failure to make discovery.

   These rules do not preclude an independent action against a person not a party for permission to enter upon property.

Rule 4010. Physical and Mental Examination of Persons.
 (a)(1)  As used in this rule, ‘‘examiner’’ means a licensed physician, licensed dentist or licensed psychologist.

   (2)(a)  When the mental or physical condition of a party, or of a person in the custody or under the legal control of a party, is in controversy, the court in which the action is pending may order the party to submit to a physical or mental examination by an examiner or to produce for examination the person in the party’s custody or legal control.

   Official Note

   The examination may include blood or genetic testing.

   (3)  The order may be made only on motion for good cause shown and upon notice to the person to be examined and to all parties and shall specify the time, place, manner, conditions and scope of the examination and the person or persons by whom it is to be made.

   (4)(i)  The person to be examined shall have the right to have counsel or other representative present during the examination. The examiner’s oral interrogation of the person to be examined shall be limited to matters specifically relevant to the scope of the examination.

   Official Note

   Ordinarily, the facts giving rise to liability are not germane to an examination and the information which the examiner seeks should be limited to facts of liability germane to the issue of damages.

     (ii)   Subdivision (a)(4)(i) shall not apply to actions for custody, partial custody and visitation of minor children.

   (5)(i)  The party who is being examined or who is producing for examination a person in the party’s custody or legal control may have made upon reasonable notice and at the party’s expense a stenographic or audio recording of the examination. Upon request and payment of reasonable cost, the party who caused the recording to be made shall provide each other party with a copy of the recording.

     (ii)   Subdivision (a)(5)(i) shall not apply to actions for custody, partial custody and visitation of minor children.

 (b)(1)  If requested by the party against whom an order is made under this rule or the person examined, the party causing the examination to be made shall deliver to the requesting party or person a copy of a detailed written report of the examiner setting out the examiner’s findings, including results of all tests made, diagnoses and conclusions, together with like reports of all earlier examinations of the same condition. After delivery the party causing the examination shall be entitled upon request to receive from the party against whom the order is made a like report of any examination, previously or thereafter made, of the same condition, unless, in the case of a report of examination of a person not a party, the party shows inability to obtain it. The court on motion may make an order against a party requiring delivery of a report on such terms as are just, and if an examiner fails or refuses to make a report the court shall exclude the examiner’s testimony if offered at the trial.

   (2)  By requesting and obtaining a report of the examination so ordered or by taking the deposition of the examiner, the party examined waives any privilege the party may have in that action or any other involving the same controversy, regarding the testimony of every other person who has examined or may thereafter examine the party in respect of the same mental or physical condition.

   (3)  Subdivision (b) applies to an examination made by agreement of the parties, unless the agreement expressly provides otherwise. It does not preclude discovery of a report of an examiner or the taking of a deposition of the examiner in accordance with the provisions of any other rule.

Explanatory Note
   Prior Rule 4010 has been substantially revised to conform closely to Fed. R.Civ.P. 35. It makes the following changes in the prior practice:

   (1) The Federal Rule covers a party and also a person in the custody or legal control of a party. This expansion is incorporated in the amendment.

   (2) The amendment introduces a specific requirement of ‘‘good cause shown’’ and notice to all parties and to the person to be examined. Actually, this makes no change in present practice. Good cause and notice were implicit in the prior Rule, which required a showing that the physical or mental condition was in controversy in the action. Good cause and notice are intended to protect parties against undue invasion of their rights to privacy.

   (3) Subdivision (b)(1) gives the party against whom the order is issued the right to require the examining physician to give him a report of the results of all tests made and his diagnoses and conclusions, including like reports of all earlier examinations of the same condition to which the examining physician may have had access. This would include the results of X-rays, cardiograms or other tests. If such a report is requested and received, the recipient must reciprocate, on request, and deliver a copy of all prior or later examinations made by his physician. Sanctions are provided for refusal. This follows Fed. R.Civ.P. 35(b)(1).

   (4) Subdivision (b)(2) provides that if a report is requested and received under subdivision (b)(1) or if the deposition of the examining physician is taken, the party examined waives any privilege he may have concerning the testimony of anyone who may have examined him earlier or thereafter. This follows Fed. R.Civ.P. 35(b)(2).

   (5) Subdivision (b)(3) provides that examinations made by agreement of the parties may be subject to production under the Rule and that discovery of the report of an examining physician or deposing him under other Rules is not precluded. This follows Fed. R.Civ.P. 35(b)(3) as amended in 1970.

   In practice, medical reports, as part of the special damages, are routinely submitted during settlement discussions, sometimes even before suit is commenced. There was little litigation over prior Rule 4010 and there should be relatively little under the amended Rule.

Rule 4010.1. Evaluation of Earning Capacity.
 (a)  When the earning capacity of a party, or of a person in the custody or under the legal control of a party, is in controversy, the court in which the action is pending may order the party to submit to an evaluation by a suitably licensed or certified evaluator or to produce for evaluation the person in the party’s custody or legal control.

 (b)  The evaluation shall be subject to the provisions of Rule 4010(a)(3) through (b)(3) inclusive.

 (c)  The evaluator may testify as a witness on the issue of damages only and not as a witness on the issue of liability.

Rule 4011. Limitation of Scope of Discovery.
 No discovery, including discovery of electronically stored information, shall be permitted which

 (a)  is sought in bad faith;

 (b)  would cause unreasonable annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, burden or expense to the deponent or any person or party;

 (c)  is beyond the scope of discovery as set forth in Rules 4003.1 through 4003.6;

 (d)  is prohibited by any law barring disclosure of mediation communications and mediation documents; or

   Official Note

   Section 5949 of the Judicial Code, 43 Pa.C.S. §  5949, provides, with specified exceptions, that all mediation communications and mediation documents are privileged. See Section 5949(c) for definitions of mediation communication and mediation document.

 (e)  would require the making of an unreasonable investigation by the deponent or any party or witness.

   Official Note

   As with all other discovery rules, this rule governs electronically stored information. See the explanatory comment preceding Rule 4009.1.

Explanatory Note
   The amendments, as already pointed out, make two important changes in present Rule 4011. They delete subdivision (d) limiting the discovery of trial preparation material, and subdivision (f) forbidding any discovery which would require a deponent, whether or not a party, to give an opinion as an expert witness over his objection. These changes have already been discussed under Rules 4003.3 to 4003.5, supra. Minor stylistic changes have been made in subdivision (b). The provision protecting trade secrets or other confidential research, development, or commercial information has been transposed from subdivision (c) to Rule 4012(a)(9).

   The provisions of this Rule 4011 amended November 20, 1978, effective April 16, 1979, 8 Pa.B. 3551; amended March 5, 1997, effective July 1, 1997, 27 Pa.B. 1443; amended August 20, 2004, effective October 1, 2004, 34 Pa.B. 4881; amended June 6, 2012, effective August 1, 2012, 42 Pa.B. 3574. Immediately preceding text appears at serial page (305444).

Rule 4012. Protective Orders.
 (a)  Upon motion by a party or by the person from whom discovery or deposition is sought, and for good cause shown, the court may make any order which justice requires to protect a party or person from unreasonable annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, burden or expense, including one or more of the following:

   (1)  that the discovery or deposition shall be prohibited;

   (2)  that the discovery or deposition shall be only on specified terms and conditions, including a designation of the time and place;

   (3)  that the discovery or deposition shall be only by a method of discovery or deposition other than that selected by the party seeking discovery or deposition;

   (4)  that certain matters shall not be inquired into;

   (5)  that the scope of discovery or deposition shall be limited;

   (6)  that discovery or deposition shall be conducted with no one present except persons designated by the court;

   (7)  that a deposition shall be sealed and shall be opened only by order of the court;

   (8)  that the parties simultaneously shall file specified documents or information enclosed in sealed envelopes to be opened as directed by the court;

   (9)  that a trade secret or other confidential research, development or commercial information shall not be disclosed or be disclosed only in a designated way.

 If the motion for a protective order is denied in whole or in part, the court may, on such terms and conditions as are just, order that any party or person provide or permit discovery.

   Official Note

   Motions for a protective order are governed by the motion rules, Rule 208.1 et seq. A court of common pleas, by local rule numbered Local Rule 208.2(e), may require that the motion contain a certification that counsel has conferred or attempted to confer with all interested parties in order to resolve the matter without court action.

 (b)  At any time during the taking of a deposition, on motion of any party or of the deponent, the court may order the officer conducting the examination to cease forthwith from taking the deposition, or may limit the scope and manner of the taking of the deposition as provided in subdivision (a). If the order made terminates the examination it shall be resumed thereafter only upon order of the court. Upon demand of the objecting party or deponent, the taking of the deposition shall be suspended for the time necessary to make a motion for an order and to obtain the court’s ruling thereon.

Explanatory Note
   Under the prior practice, protective orders were available in depositions or discovery on oral examination (Rule 4012) or on written interrogatories (Rule 4004(e)). They were not specifically included in interrogatories to parties (Rule 4005) or in general discovery (Rule 4007). The amendment provides a comprehensive Rule which covers all depositions and all discovery. This follows Fed. R.Civ.P. 26(c).

   The eight subdivisions of prior Rule 4012(a) remain, with stylistic changes which broaden their scope. No major change is made in principle. A new ninth subdivision is added, transposing the provisions of former Rule 4011(c) dealing with trade secrets, research and development. The nine subdivisions are defined as examples of the broad principle of protecting against ‘‘unreasonable annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, burden or expense.’’ The power of the court should be adequate to furnish any needed protection.

   A self-explanatory clause is added at the end of subdivision (a) empowering the court, if it denies the protective order, to order that discovery go forward.

   The amendment permits a simple motion procedure for a protective order. This is not necessarily the exclusive procedure for obtaining relief. The various forms of protective order authorized by the Rule can be included by the court in orders entered at other stages of the litigation, if appropriate. For example, a stay of all proceedings will automatically block any pending or prospective discovery.

   The last sentence of former subdivision (b) is deleted, since all provisions for expenses and attorneys’ fees as sanctions are consolidated in Rule 4019, infra.

Source
   The provisions of this Rule 4012 amended November 20, 1978, effective April 16, 1979, 8 Pa.B. 3551; amended October 24, 2003, effective 9 months after the date of the Order, 33 Pa.B. 5506. Immediately preceding text appears at serial pages (243960) to (243961) and (255409).

Rule 4013. Stay of Proceedings.
 The filing of a motion for a protective order shall not stay the deposition, production, entry on land or other discovery to which the motion is directed unless the court shall so order. The court for good cause shown may stay any or all proceedings in the action until disposition of the motion.

Explanatory Note
   Former Rule 4013 provided that the filing of any motion or application directed to a deposition or to discovery would automatically stay proceedings with respect to that deposition or discovery. Further, the court could also stay all proceedings in the action until disposition of the motion or application. It had no counterpart in the Federal Rules. Under federal practice the filing of a motion for a protective order will not constitute a stay unless a stay order is granted.

   The automatic stay under former Rule 4013 presented the possibility of misuse. Assume one party notices an emergency deposition of a going, aged or infirm witness. Assume his opponent files a motion for a protective order. This will automatically stay the deposition. The witness may be dead or may have left the Commonwealth before the motion is disposed of and the stay is lifted.

   If the motion, in such a case, was frivolous and filed in bad faith, simply to assure no deposition before death or departure, Rule 4019(h) authorized the imposition of counsel fees and costs. This will be a hollow benefit if the testimony of an important witness is irrevocably lost.

   A number of alternative solutions for controlling misuse were suggested, including a provision for timely filing as a prerequisite to automatic stay, or limiting the automatic stay to 48 hours unless the court granted a further stay. None of these adequately solved the difficulties presented by the automatic stay procedure. Timely filing was imprecise as to time and the fixed 48-hour period failed to reach critical situations in the case of going or aged witnesses.

   The amendment therefore abolishes all automatic stay and adopts the federal practice requiring a stay order in all cases. It is recognized that this will impose on the courts the creation of necessary administrative machinery to insure prompt access to and prompt action by the court. A judge must be available on short notice.

   This has worked well in the federal courts and should work equally well in our courts.

   In urgent discovery and deposition matters, there is no place for motion and argument lists held only once a month or quarterly. This is not a matter limited to protective orders; it cuts across the whole field of obstructive and dilatory tactics to frustrate discovery.

   In many counties the machinery already exists, with special assignment of motion judges available at all times. Most counties also provide for emergency judges assigned for weekends and holidays, so that no major changes in administrative machinery should be required.

   There are, in addition, a number of other Rules which provide for the equivalent of self-executing stays without special allowance, so that the need for emergency action in many instances will be obviated.

   (a) Rule 4003.4 as amended permits a party to refuse to produce the statement of a party or a witness. He needs no stay order, because the Rule puts the burden on the requesting party to move for an order for production.

   (b) Rule 4006(a)(1) provides that an answer to written interrogatories to a party may include grounds for objection. This similarly puts the burden on the inquirer to move for dismissal of the objection and a direction that the interrogatory be answered.

   (c) Rule 4019 contains a group of additional instances where the burden is placed on the moving party to move for relief on the basis of an unjustifiable refusal of a party or witness to respond. These include failure to answer interrogatories (under Rules 4004 and 4005), refusal of a party to appear for deposition after notice, refusal of a party to obey an order of court, inducing a person to refuse to obey an order of court, refusal to obey an order of court under Rule 4009 for production and inspection of documents or things or entry upon land, refusal to obey an order of court under Rule 4010 for a medical examination, and, generally, a failure to make discovery or to obey an order of court relating to discovery.

   (d) Rule 4014, regulating requests for admission, provides that the answering party may raise objections in his answer. The burden is placed on the requesting party to move for a determination of the sufficiency of the objection.  The requirement of a stay order to protect against abusive discovery should not be an excessive burden on the parties, nor should the courts be swamped with applications for a stay. The federal experience and the Pennsylvania experience suggest that there are adequate means by which counsel can protect his client and his witnesses from abusive discovery other than by seeking protective orders, and that the requirement of asking the court for a stay order in a significant case is a minor procedural act.

   The provisions of this Rule 4013 amended November 20, 1978, effective April 16, 1979, 8 Pa.B. 3551. Immediately preceding text appears at serial page (16021).

Rule 4014. Request for Admission.
 (a)  A party may serve upon any other party a written request for the admission, for purposes of the pending action only, of the truth of any matters within the scope of Rules 4003.1 through 4003.5 inclusive set forth in the request that relate to statements or opinions of fact or of the application of law to fact, including the genuineness, authenticity, correctness, execution, signing, delivery, mailing or receipt of any document described in the request. Copies of documents shall be served with the request unless they have been or are otherwise furnished or available for inspection and copying in the county. The request may, without leave of court, be served upon the plaintiff after commencement of the action and upon any other party with or after service of the original process upon that party.

 (b)  Each matter of which an admission is requested shall be separately set forth. The matter is admitted unless, within thirty days after service of the request, or within such shorter or longer time as the court may allow, the party to whom the request is directed serves upon the party requesting the admission an answer verified by the party or an objection, signed by the party or by the party’s attorney; but, unless the court shortens the time, a defendant shall not be required to serve answers or objections before the expiration of forty-five days after service of the original process upon him or her. If objection is made, the reasons therefor shall be stated. The answer shall admit or deny the matter or set forth in detail the reasons why the answering party cannot truthfully do so. A denial shall fairly meet the substance of the requested admission, and when good faith requires that a party qualify the answer or deny only a part of the matter of which an admission is requested, the party shall specify so much of it as is true and qualify or deny the remainder. An answering party may not give lack of information or knowledge as a reason for failure to admit or deny unless the answering party states that he or she has made reasonable inquiry and that the information known or readily obtainable by him or her is insufficient to enable him or her to admit or deny. A party who considers that a matter of which an admission has been requested presents a genuine issue for trial may not, on that ground alone, object to the request. That party may, subject to the provisions of Rule 4019(d), deny the matter or set forth reasons why he or she cannot admit or deny it.

   Official Note

   The requirements of an answer are governed by this rule and not by Rule 1029(b).

 (c)  The party who has requested the admission may move to determine the sufficiency of the answer or objection. Unless the court determines that an objection is justified, it shall order that an answer be served. If the court determines that an answer does not comply with the requirements of this rule, it may order either that the matter is admitted or that an amended answer be served. The court may, in lieu of these orders, determine that final disposition of the request be made at a pre-trial conference or at a designated time prior to trial.

 (d)  Any matter admitted under this rule is conclusively established unless the court on motion permits withdrawal or amendment of the admission. Subject to the provisions of Rule 212.3 governing pre-trial conferences, the court may permit withdrawal or amendment when the presentation of the merits of the action will be subserved thereby and the party who obtained the admission fails to satisfy the court that withdrawal or amendment will prejudice him or her in maintaining the action or defense on the merits. Any admission by a party under this rule is for the purpose of the pending action only and is not an admission by the party for any other purpose nor may it be used against the party in any other proceeding.

Explanatory Note
   Prior Rule 4014 has been completely revised to conform to Fed. R.Civ.P. 36 as amended in 1970.

   The amendments make the following significant changes in present practice:

   (1) The scope of the requests is enlarged. The prior Rule permitted requests for admission only as to truth of any relevant matters of fact or the genuineness of any writing, agreement, or record. The revision will cover all matters within the scope of deposition Rules 4003.1 through 4003.5. This includes all matters that relate to the truth of any matter, but also to statements or opinions of fact or of the application of law to fact.

   (2) The request may be made on any party; the prior Rule limited the request to ‘‘adverse’’ parties. The plaintiff may serve a request on any defending party after the party has been served with original process. A defending party may serve a request on the plaintiff at any time after the action is commenced.

   (3) The respondent must answer or object. The answer must admit or deny in whole or in part. The form of a denial is clarified. Lack of information or knowledge is an insufficient denial, unless he avers that he has made reasonable inquiry and that the information available is still insufficient to enable him to admit or deny. Subdivision (b), unlike the Federal Rule, requires a sworn answer. The answer or the objections may be signed by the attorney.

   (4)  The form of the denial will not be governed by Pleading Rule 1029(b). Subdivision (b) provides that a denial shall fairly meet the substance of the requested admission and when good faith requires that a party qualify his answer or deny only a part of the matter of which an admission is requested, he shall specify so much of it as is true and qualify or deny the remainder. Thus, a good faith general denial which would be insufficient under Rule 1029(b) might be sufficient here. (5) Where the respondent believes that a request for admission involves a genuine issue of fact for trial, this alone does not make the request objectionable. He must deny the matter or set forth reasons why he cannot admit or deny it. Sanction Rule 4019(d), which is specially mentioned in subdivision (b), provides that if, at trial, a party is required to prove that which should have been admitted, the expenses, including counsel fees, of proving such matters may be imposed upon the respondent unless the admission was of no substantial importance, or the request could have been held objectionable, or the respondent reasonably believed he could prevail at trial on the issue, or there was other good reason for the failure to admit.

   (6) The time periods for answer or objection are conformed to the Federal Rule and extended from 10 to 30 days or to 45 days after service of original process.

   (7) A specific procedure is provided in subdivision (c) for an early determination of the sufficiency of an answer or objection. The prior Rule provided no such determination before trial, and a party often came to trial uncertain whether the answer constituted an admission or denial. The amendment provides that the court may order the matter to be admitted or an amended answer to be served, or it may postpone the final determination of this issue to pretrial conferences or a designated time prior to trial.

   (8) Finally, subdivision (d) sets forth the terms under which an admission may be withdrawn or amended and the effect of possible prejudice to the inquirer from an amendment or withdrawal. It also contains the important condition that the admission is localized in the pending action and cannot be used against him in any other proceeding.

Rule 4015. Persons Before Whom Depositions May be Taken.
 (a)  Within the United States or within a territory or insular possession subject to the dominion of the United States, depositions shall be taken before an officer authorized to administer oaths by the laws of the United States or of this Commonwealth or of the place where the examination is held, or before a person appointed by the court in which the action is pending. A person so appointed shall have power to administer oaths and take testimony.

 (b)  In a foreign country, depositions may be taken

   (1)  on notice before a person authorized to administer oaths in the place in which the examination is held, either by the law thereof or by the law of the United States, or

   (2)  before a person commissioned by the court in which the action is pending, and a person so commissioned shall have the power by virtue of the commission to administer any necessary oath and take testimony, or

   (3)  pursuant to a letter rogatory. A commission or a letter rogatory shall be issued on application and notice and on terms that are just and appropriate. It is not requisite to the issuance of a commission or a letter rogatory that the taking of the deposition in any other manner is impracticable or inconvenient; and both a commission and a letter rogatory may be issued in proper cases. A notice or commission may designate the person before whom the deposition is to be taken either by name or descriptive title. A letter rogatory may be addressed ‘‘To the Appropriate Authority in (here name the country).’’ Evidence obtained in response to a letter rogatory need not be excluded merely for the reason that it is not a verbatim transcript or that the testimony was not taken under oath or for any similar departure from the requirements for depositions taken within the United States under these rules.

 (c)  No deposition shall be taken before a person who is a relative, employee or attorney of any of the parties, or who is a relative or employee of such attorney, or who is financially interested in the action.

Explanatory Note
   The amendments conform the Rule to Fed. R.Civ.P. 28. They make the following changes in present practice:

   (1) When depositions are to be taken within the United States or a territory or insular possession, the list of persons authorized to take the deposition is increased by adding a person appointed by the court in which the action is pending. That person thereby acquires the power to administer an oath. This permits the taking of depositions in isolated places where no one would ordinarily be found who is authorized to administer an oath, and where the parties do not stipulate that the oath be waived under Rule 4002.

   (2) When depositions are to be taken in foreign countries, the list of persons who may take the deposition will now include any person authorized to administer an oath in the place in which the examination is held, either by the law of that place or by the law of the United States. Commissions or letters rogatory remain available, and a person commissioned by the court will have the power to administer oaths or to take testimony by virtue of his commission. It is not requisite to the issuance of a commission or a letter rogatory that the taking of a deposition in any other matter is impracticable or inconvenient and both a commission and a letter may be issued in proper cases.

   In many cases international judicial assistance may be required, especially if there is a non-cooperative witness whose appearance must be compelled. A check should be made to see if the foreign country involved is a signatory to the Hague Convention for the Taking of Evidence Abroad. If so, the procedure under that Convention may be useful. (3) Evidence obtained in response to a letter rogatory may not be excluded merely for the reason that it is not a verbatim transcript or that the testimony was not taken under oath or for any similar departure from the technique used in depositions taken within the United States. This provision is essential to permit the use of testimony taken in non-common law countries where testimony may be taken before a judge or other officer who questions the witness, sometimes without administering an oath and without a verbatim transcript, and who prepares a summary of the testimony which the witness has given. While the court may not exclude the evidence for this reason, its value or weight may be affected by the method of taking or recording the testimony.

Rule 4016. Taking of Depositions. Objections.
 (a)  Objection to taking a deposition because of the disqualification of the person before whom it is to be taken is waived unless made before the taking of the deposition begins or as soon thereafter as the disqualification becomes known or could be discovered with reasonable diligence.

 (b)  Objections to the competency of a witness or to the competency, relevancy, or materiality of the testimony are not waived by failure to make them before or during the taking of the deposition, unless the ground of the objection is one which was known to the objecting party and which might have been obviated or removed if made at that time.

 (c)  Errors and irregularities occurring at the oral examination in the manner of taking the deposition, in the form of oral questions or answers, in the oath or affirmation, or in the conduct of parties and errors of any kind which might have been obviated, removed, or cured if objections had been promptly made, are waived unless seasonable objection is made at the taking of the deposition.

 (d)  All errors and irregularities in the notice for taking a deposition are waived unless written objection is promptly served upon the party giving the notice.

   Official Note

   Objections to the form of written interrogatories must be made as provided by Rule 4004(b).

Explanatory Note
   This Rule remains unchanged.

Rule 4017. Transcript of Testimony. Objections.
 (a)  The person before whom the deposition is taken shall put the witness on oath or affirmation and shall personally or by someone acting under his or her direction and in his or her presence record the testimony of the witness.

 (b)  The testimony of the witness shall be transcribed. Objections to the manner of preparation or the correctness of the transcript are waived unless they are filed in writing with the court promptly after the grounds of objection become known or could have been discovered with reasonable diligence.

 (c)  When the testimony is fully transcribed a copy of the deposition with the original signature page shall be submitted to the witness for inspection and signing and shall be read to or by the witness and shall be signed by the witness, unless the inspection, reading and signing are waived by the witness and by all parties who attended the taking of the deposition, or the witness is ill or cannot be found or refuses to sign. Any changes in form or substance which the witness desires to make shall be entered upon the deposition by the person before whom it was taken with a statement of the reasons given by the witness for making the changes. If the deposition is not signed by the witness within thirty days of its submission to the witness, the person before whom the deposition was taken shall sign it and state on the record the fact of the waiver or of the illness or absence of the witness or the refusal to sign together with the reason, if any, given therefor; and the deposition may then be used as fully as though signed, unless the court holds that the reasons given for the refusal to sign require rejection of the deposition in whole or in part.

 (d)  The person before whom the deposition is taken shall certify on the deposition that the witness was duly sworn and that the deposition is a true record of the testimony given by the witness.

 (e)  In lieu of participating in the oral examination, parties served with notice of taking a deposition may transmit written interrogatories to the person taking the deposition, who shall propound them to the witness and record the answers verbatim.

 (f)  Upon payment of reasonable charges, the person before whom the deposition was taken shall furnish a copy thereof to any party or to the deponent.

Explanatory Note
   Minor stylistic changes have been made in this Rule. In addition, a time limit of 30 days is given the witness to make any changes in the transcript of the deposition and to sign it.

Rule 4017.1. Video Depositions.
 (a)  Any deposition upon oral examination may be taken as a matter of course as a video deposition by means of simultaneous audio and visual electronic recording. Except as provided by this rule, the rules of this chapter governing the practice and procedure in depositions and discovery shall apply.

   (1)  Any party may have a video deposition recorded simultaneously by stenographic means as provided by this chapter.

   (2)  A video deposition may be used in court only if accompanied by a transcript of the deposition.

 (b)  Every notice or subpoena for the taking of a video deposition shall state

   (1)  that the deposition is to be taken as a video deposition,

   (2)  the name and address of the person whose deposition is to be taken,

   (3)  the name and address of the officer before whom it is to be taken,

   (4)  whether the deposition is to be simultaneously recorded by stenographic means, and

   (5)  the name and address of the video operator and of his or her employer. The operator may be an employe of the attorney taking the deposition.

 (c)  The deposition shall begin by the operator stating on camera (1) his or her name and address, (2) the name and address of his or her employer, (3) the date, time and place of the deposition, (4) the caption of the case, (5) the name of the witness, and (6) the party on whose behalf the deposition is being taken. The officer before whom the deposition is taken shall then identify himself or herself and swear the witness on camera. At the conclusion of the deposition the operator shall state on camera that the deposition is concluded. When the length of the deposition requires the use of more than one videotape, the end of the videotape and the beginning of each succeeding videotape shall be announced on camera by the operator.

 (d)  The deposition shall be timed by a digital clock on camera which shall show continually each hour, minute and second of each videotape of the deposition.

 (e)  No signature of the witness shall be required.

 (f)  The attorney for the party taking the deposition shall take custody of and be responsible for the safeguarding of the videotape and shall permit the viewing of and shall provide a copy of the videotape or the audio portion thereof upon the request and at the cost of a party.

 (g)  In addition to the uses permitted by Rule 4020 a video deposition of a medical witness or any witness called as an expert, other than a party, may be used at trial for any purpose whether or not the witness is available to testify.

 (h)  At a trial or hearing that part of the audio portion of a video deposition which is offered in evidence and admitted, or which is excluded on objection, shall be transcribed in the same manner as the testimony of other witnesses. The videotape shall be marked as an exhibit and may remain in the custody of the court.

   Official Note

   Local rules and practice shall regulate the procedure for handling objections to questions and answers on the videotape. Suggested devices include inter alia, previewing by the judge and counsel and withholding from the evidence material to which objections are sustained; or having the operator turn off the audio portion of the videotape at the trial or hearing to exclude objectionable material or the use of ‘‘fast forward’’ by the operator at the trial or hearing to eliminate both the image and the sound of the objectionable material.

 (i)  As used in this rule, ‘‘videotape’’ includes all media on which a video deposition may be recorded.

Explanatory Note
   This Rule remains unchanged.

   Pennsylvania was one of the first states to authorize videotape depositions. Although adopted in April, 1973 as part of a two-year experimental program, the Rule appears to have worked well in practice.

Rule 4019. Sanctions.
 (a)(1)  The court may, on motion, make an appropriate order if

     (i)   a party fails to serve answers, sufficient answers or objections to written interrogatories under Rule 4005;

     (ii)   a corporation or other entity fails to make a designation under Rule 4004(a)(2) or 4007.1(e);

     (iii)   a person, including a person designated under Rule 4004(a)(2) to be examined, fails to answer, answer sufficiently or object to written interrogatories under Rule 4004;

     (iv)   a party or an officer, or managing agent of a party or a person designated under Rule 4007.1(e) to be examined, after notice under Rule 4007.1, fails to appear before the person who is to take the deposition;

     (v)   a party or deponent, or an officer or managing agent of a party or deponent, induces a witness not to appear;

     (vi)   a party or an officer, or managing agent of a party refuses or induces a person to refuse to obey an order of court made under subdivision (b) of this rule requiring such party or person to be sworn or to answer designated questions or an order of court made under Rule 4010;

     (vii)   a party, in response to a request for production or inspection made under Rule 4009, fails to respond that inspection will be permitted as requested or fails to permit inspection as requested;

     (viii)   a party or person otherwise fails to make discovery or to obey an order of court respecting discovery.

   (2)  A failure to act described in subdivision (a)(1) may not be excused on the ground that the discovery sought is objectionable unless the party failing to act has filed an appropriate objection or has applied for a protective order.

   Official Note

   Motions for sanctions are governed by the motion rules, Rule 208.1 et seq. A court of common pleas, by local rule numbered Local Rule 208.2(e), may require that the motion contain a certification that counsel has conferred or attempted to confer with all interested parties in order to resolve the matter without court action.

 (b)  If a deponent refuses to be sworn or to answer any question, the deposition shall be completed on other matters or adjourned, as the proponent of the question may prefer. Thereafter, on reasonable notice to all persons affected thereby, the proponent may apply to a proper court in the county where the deposition is being taken or to the court in which the action is pending, for an order compelling the witness to be sworn or to answer, under penalty of contempt, except that where the deposition of a witness not a party is to be taken outside the Commonwealth, the application shall be made only to a court of the jurisdiction in which the deposition is to be taken.

 (c)  The court, when acting under subdivision (a) of this rule, may make

   (1)  an order that the matters regarding which the questions were asked, or the character or description of the thing or land, or the contents of the paper, or any other designated fact shall be taken to be established for the purposes of the action in accordance with the claim of the party obtaining the order;

   (2)  an order refusing to allow the disobedient party to support or oppose designated claims or defenses, or prohibiting such party from introducing in evidence designated documents, things or testimony, or from introducing evidence of physical or mental condition;

   (3)  an order striking out pleadings or parts thereof, or staying further proceedings until the order is obeyed, or entering a judgment of non pros or by default against the disobedient party or party advising the disobedience;

   (4)  an order imposing punishment for contempt, except that a party may not be punished for contempt for a refusal to submit to a physical or mental examination under Rule 4010;

   (5)  such order with regard to the failure to make discovery as is just.

 (d)  If at the trial or hearing, a party who has requested admissions as authorized by Rule 4014 proves the matter which the other party has failed to admit as requested, the court on motion may enter an order taxing as costs against the other party the reasonable expenses incurred in making such proof, including attorney’s fees, unless the court finds that

   (1)  the request was or could have been held objectionable pursuant to Rule 4014, or

   (2)  the admission sought was of no substantial importance, or

   (3)  the party failing to admit had reasonable ground to believe that he or she might prevail on the matter, or

   (4)  there was other good reason for the failure to admit.

 (e)  If the party giving the notice of the taking of a deposition fails to attend and proceed therewith and another party attends in person or by attorney pursuant to the notice, the court may order the party giving the notice to pay to such other party the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred by such other party and his or her attorney in so attending, including attorney’s fees.

 (f)  If the party giving the notice of the taking of a deposition of a witness fails to serve a subpoena upon the witness and because of such failure the witness does not attend, and if another party attends in person or by attorney expecting the deposition of that witness to be taken, the court may order the party giving the notice to pay to such other party the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred by such other party and his or her attorney in so attending, including attorney’s fees.

 (g)(1)  Except as otherwise provided in these rules, if following the refusal, objection or failure of a party or person to comply with any provision of this chapter, the court, after opportunity for hearing, enters an order compelling compliance and the order is not obeyed, the court on a subsequent motion for sanctions may, if the motion is granted, require the party or deponent whose conduct necessitated the motions or the party or attorney advising such conduct or both of them to pay to the moving party the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred in obtaining the order of compliance and the order for sanctions, unless the court finds that the opposition to the motion was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.

   (2)  If the motion for sanctions is denied, the court shall, after opportunity for hearing, require the moving party or the attorney advising the motion or both of them to pay to the party or deponent who opposed the motion the reasonable expenses incurred in opposing the motion, including attorney’s fees, unless the court finds that the making of the motion was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.

   (3)  If the motion for sanctions is granted in part and denied in part, the court may apportion the reasonable expenses incurred in relation to the motion among the parties and persons in a just manner.

   Official Note

   For other special provisions authorizing the award of expenses including attorney fees see Rule 4008 where a deposition is to be taken more than 100 miles from the courthouse; 4019(d) where a party unjustifiably refuses to admit causing the other party to incur expenses of proof at trial; 4019(e) and (f) where a party notices a deposition and fails to appear or to subpoena a witness to appear causing the other party to incur unnecessary expenses; and 4019(h) where a party files motions or applications for the purpose of delay or bad faith.

 (h)  If the filing of a motion or making of an application under this chapter is for the purpose of delay or in bad faith, the court may impose on the party making the motion or application the reasonable costs, including attorney’s fees, actually incurred by the opposing party by reason of such delay or bad faith. A party upon whom such costs have been imposed may neither (1) take any further step in the suit without prior leave of court so long as such costs remain unpaid nor (2) recover such costs if ultimately successful in the action.

 (i)  A witness whose identity has not been revealed as provided in this chapter shall not be permitted to testify on behalf of the defaulting party at the trial of the action. However, if the failure to disclose the identity of the witness is the result of extenuating circumstances beyond the control of the defaulting party, the court may grant a continuance or other appropriate relief.

 (j)  Expenses and attorney’s fees may not be imposed upon the Commonwealth under this rule.

Explanatory Note
   Former Rule 4019 worked reasonably well since it was first adopted in 1950. Amendments were, however, necessary to reflect the many amendments in other Rules. Opportunity was taken to make additional amendments to approach more closely the language of Fed. R.Civ.P. 37.

   (1) Subdivision (a)(viii) is a blanket authorization to the court to enter a sanction order whenever there is a failure to make discovery or to obey an order of the court. The preceding subsections of subdivision (a) set out a series of specific violations of Rules 4004, 4005, 4007.1, 4007.2, 4009 and 4010 which are included in the blanket authorization. These are only illustrations and do not limit the all-inclusive coverage of subsection (viii).

   (2) Prior Rule 4019(a) required a showing that an offender had acted ‘‘wilfully.’’ This word has been deleted. The court may impose sanctions even if the failure is not wilful. Wilfulness of course may be a factor in determining the extent of the sanction but it will not be an essential condition precedent to the power to impose a sanction.

   (3) A new subdivision (a)(2), taken from Fed. R.Civ.P. 37(4), provides that failure to permit deposition or discovery may not be excused on the ground that the discovery sought is objectionable, unless the party failing to act has filed an appropriate objection or has applied for a protective order.

   Subdivision (b) remains unchanged, except that the procedure for imposition of expenses and counsel fees is transposed to the new subdivision (g).

   Subdivision (c) remains unchanged except for the addition of a catch-all subsection (5).

   Subdivision (d) permits an award of expenses including counsel fees where a party has unjustifiably failed or refused to admit requests for admissions under Rule 4014, and the inquirer is thereafter compelled to prove the unadmitted facts at the trial. This has been discussed in the commentary to Rule 4014, supra.

   Subdivisions (e) and (f) are unchanged. These also permit the sanction of expenses, including counsel fees. These provisions have been rarely invoked in practice. They remind counsel that lack of professional courtesy in notifying opposing counsel that parties or witnesses may not attend a deposition may subject them to sanctions.

   Subdivision (g) contains novel provisions with respect to the imposition of expenses and counsel fees in situations other than those regulated in subdivisions (d), (e), (f) and (h). These four sub-sections cover requests for admissions, failure of a party or a witness to attend depositions and the filing motion or application in bad faith or for purposes of delay.

   These constitutes a relatively small area of deposition and discovery practice. They do not include the situations regulated in subdivisions (a), (b) and (c), which cover the more common situations of interrogatories and answers, oral depositions on notice, production of documents and things and physical and mental examinations.

   The prior Rule contained no provision for expenses and counsel fees in these situations except in subdivision (b), the case where a witness refused to be sworn or to answer.

   Fed. R.Civ.P. 37(a)(4) provides that, if a party is successful in obtaining an order of compliance, the court shall, at the same time and without waiting to see if the order of compliance is obeyed, award expenses including counsel fees unless the failure, refusal or objection of the offending party is found to be substantially justified. Conversely, the court shall impose counsel fees against the parties unsuccessful in seeking a compliance order unless their conduct was substantially justified. If the motion is granted in part and refused in part, the court could in its discretion apportion expenses in a just manner.

   The amendment suggest a new approach. It refers generally to ‘‘refusal, objection or failure of a party or person to comply with any provision of this chapter’’ which could hardly be more all-inclusive. However, it preserves the special provisions of subdivisions (d), (e), (f) and (h) by the phrase ‘‘except as otherwise provided in these rules.’’ As to those situations not covered by subdivisions (d), (e), (f) and (h), it requires a ‘‘two step’’ procedure rather than the ‘‘single step’’ procedure of the Federal Rule.

   The first step under subdivision (g)(1) is a motion to compel compliance. If, after a hearing, the motion is granted and depositions or discovery are ordered and the party against whom it is directed complies, that is the end of the matter as far as expenses and counsel fees are concerned. There can be no award of expenses and fees. If the order to comply is not obeyed, the aggrieved party may file a new motion to impose sanctions. The court, at this ‘‘second step’’ of the proceedings, may award expenses and counsel fees for either or both steps depending upon how the court views the conduct of the defaulting party and his counsel. The Rule permits the court to decline any award if the court finds that the opposition to the motion was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award unjust. Similarly, if the second step procedure is unsuccessful and no award is made, subdivision (g)(2) authorizes the court to impose expenses including counsel fees on the moving party unless the court finds that the making of the second step motion was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust. Finally, subdivision (g)(3) permits the court to apportion expenses among the parties if the motion for sanctions is granted in part and denied in part.

   An order of compliance entered in the first step of the proceedings, which is not obeyed, will ordinarily supply substantial justification for the second step procedure requesting sanctions including expenses and counsel fees. There may be exceptional circumstances where the second step will fail. For example, there may be a failure to notify the respondent and the failure to comply may have resulted from no knowledge of the order. Or, the order of compliance may have directed the respondent to do something which the Rules do not permit or which was beyond the jurisdiction of the court.

   Reference is made in the commentary to Rule 4003 of a possible ambiguity in the availability of sanctions under the prior Rule for failure of a party to appear for a deposition taken on a petition, motion or rule. Any such ambiguity will be removed by the all-inclusive language of subdivision (g)(1).

   The amendment authorizes the court, if it grants the motion for sanctions, to impose the payment of the expenses on the guilty party or deponent or on the attorney who advised the conduct or on both. If the motion for sanctions is refused, the court is authorized to impose the expenses on the moving party or on the attorney who advised the filing of the motion or on both.

   These are powerful disciplinary tools, if the courts will use them. The placing of the burden to escape the expenses and counsel fees on the shoulders of the losing party, plus the new provision for imposing the sanction on the attorney, will hopefully assure compliance with the Discovery Rules and a minimum of sanction proceedings.

   Subdivision (h) adds a new provision for expenses and counsel fees not expressly found in the Federal Rule. It provides that if the filing of a motion or application is in bad faith or for the purpose of delay, the court may impose on the party making the motion reasonable costs, including attorney’s fees, incurred by the opposing party by reason of such delay or bad faith. The party on whom such costs have been imposed may take no further steps in the action without leave of court so long as the costs remain unpaid and may not recover such cost if ultimately successful in the action. The language of this Rule has been adapted from Rule 217 governing the imposition of costs in connection with continuances.

   Independent of the above provisions, Rule 4008 provides that, as to oral depositions to be taken more than 100 miles from the courthouse, expenses including counsel fees may be imposed in the discretion of the court. This is of course not a sanction provision.

   Subdivision (i) adds a new provision for sanctions for failure to identify witnesses as to whom discovery has been sought. A witness whose identity has not been revealed as provided by the Rules will not be permitted to testify at trial. If the failure to disclose his identity was the result of extenuating circumstances beyond the control of the defaulting party, the court may grant a continuance or other appropriate relief.

   Subdivision (j) is former subdivision (g) with only a minor stylistic change. It forbids the imposition of expenses and counsel fees on the Commonwealth.

   The amendment does not compel a party who has identified a witness under Rule 4003.1 as having ‘‘knowledge of discoverable matter’’ to call the witness at the trial. Nor, except as to the disclosure under Rule 4003.5(b) of the identity of experts expected to be called at trial, is a party required to present a ‘‘witness list’’ of those he intends to call at trial. Nor can an opponent claim surprise if an identified witness is not called on the ground that this tactic deprives him of the opportunity for cross-examination. He could have taken his deposition before trial.

   The Rule does not deal specifically with the difficult problem of rebuttal witnesses. A plaintiff may not identify persons who can testify to rebut a particular defense because the defendant’s pleadings and discovery do not clearly identify that defense. If the defendant introduces this defense at the trial, should the court exclude the plaintiff’s rebuttal witness, on the ground that he did not ‘‘identify’’ this witness? A skilled plaintiff can avoid this danger by careful discovery from the defendant, which will force a disclosure of all the defenses.

   The problem, of course, can arise only if the defendant has asked the plaintiff to identify all persons ‘‘having knowledge,’’ and the plaintiff has done so.

Rule 4020. Use of Depositions at Trial.
 (a)  At the trial, any part or all of a deposition, so far as admissible under the rules of evidence, may be used against any party who was present or represented at the taking of the deposition or who had notice thereof if required, in accordance with any one of the following provisions:

   (1)  Any deposition may be used by any party for the purpose of contradicting or impeaching the testimony of a deponent as a witness, or as permitted by the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence.

   (2)  The deposition of a party or of any one who at the time of taking the deposition was an officer, director, or managing agent of a party or a person designated under Rule 4004(a)(2) or 4007.1(e) to testify on behalf of a public or private corporation, partnership or association or governmental agency which is a party, may be used by an adverse party for any purpose.

   (3)  The deposition of a witness, whether or not a party, may be used by any party for any purpose if the court finds

     (a)   that the witness is dead, or

     (b)   that the witness is at a greater distance than one hundred miles from the place of trial or is outside the Commonwealth, unless it appears that the absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the deposition, or that the witness is unable to attend or testify because of age, sickness, infirmity or imprisonment, or that the party offering the deposition has been unable to procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena, or upon application and notice that such exceptional circumstances exist as to make it desirable, in the interest of justice and with due regard to the importance of presenting the testimony of witnesses orally in open court, to allow the deposition to be used.

   (4)  If only part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party, any other party may require the offering party to introduce all of it which is relevant to the part introduced, and any party may introduce any other parts.

   Official Note:

   See the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence for a broader statement of this rule.

   (5)  A deposition upon oral examination of a medical witness, other than a party, may be used at trial for any purpose whether or not the witness is available to testify.

 (b)  Substitution of parties does not affect the right to use depositions previously taken; and, when an action has been dismissed and another action involving the same subject is afterward brought between the same parties or their representatives or successors in interest, all depositions lawfully taken in the former action may be used in the latter as if originally taken therein. A deposition previously taken may also be used as permitted by the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence.

 (c)  Subject to the provisions of Rule 4016(b), objection may be made at the trial or hearing to receiving in evidence any deposition or part thereof for any reason which would require the exclusion of the evidence if the witness were then present and testifying.

 (d)  A party shall not be deemed to make a person his or her own witness for any purpose by taking the person’s deposition. The introduction in evidence of the deposition or any part thereof for any purpose other than that of contradicting or impeaching the deponent makes the deponent the witness of the party introducing the deposition, but this shall not apply to the use of an adverse party of a deposition as described in subdivision (a)(2) of this rule. At the trial or hearing any party may rebut any relevant evidence contained in a deposition whether introduced by that party or by any other party.

Explanatory Note
   Except for minor stylistic amendments this Rule remains unchanged, except for a new subdivision (a)(5) permitting the use at trial of a deposition upon oral examination of a medical witness, other than a party, whether or not the witness is available to testify.

   The rising costs of obtaining the testimony at trial of medical experts and the inconvenience which may be caused to the medical witness and to his patients, have suggested relaxation of the requirement that a medical witness who is available to testify must be produced at trial. The witness may have to appear a total of three times, first, at a deposition, second, at a compulsory arbitration hearing and third, at trial in the Common Pleas Court.

   Videotape Rule 4017.1(g) recognizes this hardship by permitting use at trial of the videotape deposition of a medical witness even if he is available to appear. Rule 1809(b) similarly provides that on a de novo appeal to the Common Pleas Court from a Health Care Arbitration Panel the deposition of any medical witness offered during arbitration shall be admissible whether or not the witness is available at trial on the appeal.

   In fact, these two Rules go beyond the medical witness and give the same privilege to any ‘‘other’’ expert witness.

   To the contrary, subdivision (a)(5) is limited to medical witnesses.

   The Committee was concerned about the effect of the inclusion of ‘‘other experts’’ in this Rule which permits a deposition to be read at a trial in lieu of the appearance of a witness who is available to appear.

   The videotape situation is different. Here the jury or the court will see the witness and can observe his demeanor. Although there may be a reduction in the size of the image and the reproduction may not be perfect, it is a far cry from having someone read from a stenographic transcript the words of an absent person.

   The Health Care Services cases are also different. These are by definition medical malpractice cases. Here the issues are basically medical and majority of expert witnesses will be medical witnesses. Sometimes there will be issues which will need a non-medical expert witness, but these issues will necessarily be subordinate to the essential medical character of the trial. For example, an issue might be the construction and operating efficiency of a piece of hospital equipment or the purity of a drug which was administered.

   It is obvious that Rule 4020 is different from Rules 4017.1 and 1809(b). This Rule covers every kind of action at law or in equity. The types of experts and the nature of their testimony will be almost unlimited. These experts will have no ‘‘personal’’ problems like the physician, whose problems have been the justification for special treatment. The ‘‘other experts’’ may talk about real estate values, actuarial formulas, exploding bottles, concrete construction, security values, fire alarm systems, defective steering assemblies, false signatures, urban planning, defective heating systems, ballistics and the endless list of topics which can be the focus of expertise in litigation.

   If these manifold experts do not appear on videotape, what special reason is there for the jury never to see them, if they are available to appear at the trial?

 These Rules shall be known as the Pennsylvania Orphans' Court Rules, shall be referred to individually herein as ''Rule,'' and cited as ''Pa.O.C. Rule ______ .''

 Note: Rule 1.1 is substantively similar to former Rule 17.

Rule 1.2. Construction and Application of Rules.
 (a) The Rules adopted by the Supreme Court regulating the practice and procedure of the Orphans' Court Divisions of this Commonwealth and the local rules adopted by such courts shall be liberally construed to secure the just, timely and efficient determination of every action or proceeding to which they are applicable.

 Explanatory Comment: The Orphans' Court Division exercises equitable powers and applies equitable principles. Estate of Hahn, 369 A.2d 1290, 1291-92 (Pa. 1977); Estate of Freihofer, 174 A.2d 282, 284 (Pa. 1961).

 The question frequently arises as to the effect and use of the notes and explanatory comments which are issued with the Orphans' Court Rules. Notes and explanatory comments are not part of the Rules but they may be used in construing the Rules. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has stated in Laudenberger v. Port Authority of Allegheny County, 436 A.2d 147, 151 (Pa. 1981):

These explanatory notes have not been officially adopted or promulgated by this Court, nor do they constitute part of the rule.

 (e) All proposed local rules and proposed amendments to local rules shall be submitted in writing to the Supreme Court Orphans' Court Procedural Rules Committee (''Committee'') for review in advance of becoming effective. The submitting court shall not adopt the proposed local rule or proposed amendment to the local rule until the submitting court receives written notification from the Committee that the proposed local rule or the proposed amendment to the local rule is not inconsistent with these Rules.

 (f) After written notification is received from the Committee, the submitting court shall comply with all the following requirements:

 (1) The local rule shall be set forth in writing;

 (2) One certified paper copy of the local rule shall be filed with the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts;

 (3) Two certified paper copies of the local rule and a computer diskette or a CD-ROM that complies with requirements of 1 Pa. Code § 13.11(b), or an agreed-upon alternate format, containing the text of the local rule shall be distributed to the Legislative Reference Bureau for publication in the Pennsylvania Bulletin;

In any case of noncompliance with a local rule, the court shall advise the party of the specific provision at issue and provide a reasonable time for the party to comply with the local rule. Subsequent noncompliance may result in court-imposed sanctions.

 (i) The Committee may at any time recommend that the Supreme Court suspend, vacate, or require amendment of a local rule.

 Note: Rule 1.5 is new; but, the procedures for promulgating local rules are based upon former Rule 1.2 and have been modeled after those found in Pa.R.Crim.P. 105. The Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts maintains a web site containing the texts of local rules at http://www.pacourts.us/T/SpecialCourts/LocalRules.htm.

 Explanatory Comment: After the court has alerted the party to the local rule pursuant to subparagraph (h), the court may impose a sanction for subsequent noncompliance either on the individual party or counsel who has entered a written appearance on behalf of a party, but may not dismiss the petition, or grant or deny relief because of noncompliance with the local rule. Cf. Pa.R.Crim.P. 105 Comment.

Rule 1.6. Mediation by Agreement, Local Rule, or Court Order.
 All parties having an interest in a matter may participate by written agreement, or the court by local rule or order in a particular matter may provide for the parties to participate, in private mediation or in court-supervised mediation.

 Note: Rule 1.6 has no counterpart in former Orphans' Court Rules.

 Explanatory Comment: The confidentiality of mediation is provided by statute, See 42 Pa.C.S. § 5949.

Rule 1.7. Entry and Withdrawal of Counsel.
 (a) Appearance. Any counsel appearing before the court or the Register shall enter a written appearance by any one of the following means:

 (1) filing an entry of appearance with the clerk or the Register;

 (2) signing a legal paper that is filed with the clerk or the Register; or

 (3) as prescribed by local rule, which may include submitting an appearance slip to the court, entering counsel's information when a legal paper is filed, or signing a cover sheet.

 (b) Withdrawal. Counsel who has entered an appearance before the court as provided in subparagraph (a) shall not be permitted to withdraw without filing a petition to withdraw and obtaining the court's leave, unless co-counsel, if any, will continue representing the party or there is a simultaneous entry of appearance by other counsel that will not delay the litigation.

 Note: Rule 1.7 has no counterpart in former Orphans' Court Rules, but is based upon many local rules of similar import.

 Explanatory Comment: Admission pro hac vice in accordance with Pennsylvania Bar Admission Rule 301 shall proceed by request, the disposition and content of which shall conform to the requirements of Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure No. 1012.1.

Rule 1.8. Forms.
 (a) The forms approved by the Supreme Court for statewide practice and procedure before the Registers and courts shall be used exclusively by all Registers and clerks. Where a Supreme Court-approved form exists, no other form shall be allowed or required by local rule or practice.

 (b) The forms approved by the Supreme Court for statewide practice are set forth in an Appendix to these Rules. The forms may be revised and supplemented from time to time. The forms shall also be maintained for public access at the official website of the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts.

 (c) A court may require a legal paper to be accompanied by a cover sheet or checklist. A court that imposes such requirements must promulgate a local rule, numbered Local Rule 1.8(c), stating the requirements and setting forth the form of the cover sheet or checklist.

 Note: Rule 1.8 is substantively similar to former Rule 1.3, but with some modifications.

 Explanatory Comment: Rule 1.8 has been modified from former Rule 1.3 by now mandating the exclusive use of statewide forms promulgated by the Supreme Court. Previously, forms approved or mandated for use pursuant to local rule could be accepted by the local register and clerk so long as the local register and clerk also permitted and accepted forms promulgated by the Supreme Court. Now, if the Supreme Court has promulgated or approved a form for use before the register or clerk, then such form is the only one that may be used by the applicant or petitioner and is the only one that can be accepted by the local register or clerk. The mandatory statewide forms are set forth in the Appendix attached hereto. The current website for electronic access to the forms is found at www.pacourts.us/forms under the For-the-Public category. The forms posted on the website are capable of on-line completion.

 (d) When a non-profit corporation incorporated for charitable purposes or a cemetery company is required to file an Account, such corporation or company may file its financial statements for its three most recent fiscal years in lieu of filing an Account in the form required by this Rule. Financial statements shall be verified to be true and correct by a representative of the non-profit corporation or cemetery company.

 (1) The court may require the corporation or company to submit its financial information in some other form or for some longer period.

 (2) The court may require more or less financial information as it deems appropriate, including some or all of the following:

 (i) the statute or other authority under which the corporation or company was incorporated and the date of its incorporation;

 (ii) the names and addresses of the trustees or directors of the corporation or company;

 (iii) a concise statement of the general purpose of the corporation or company; and

 (iv) a copy of the corporation's or company's charter or articles of incorporation and bylaws.

 Note: Rule 2.1 is substantively similar to former Rule 6.1 and Rule 12.15, except that certain subparagraphs have been reordered and Rule 12.15 and its Official Note have become subparagraph (d).

 Explanatory Comment: Piggy-backed Accounts and limited Accounts are permitted pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. §§ 762, 3501.2, and 7799.1.

Rule 2.2. Form; Assets Transferred by the Exercise of a Power of Appointment.
 Assets that are appointed pursuant to the exercise of a power of appointment shall be accounted for separately, and testamentary assets shall be segregated from appointive assets.

 Note: Rule 2.2 has been revised but remains substantively similar to subparagraph (d) of former Rule 6.1.

Rule 2.3. Form; Separate Accounts for Minors.
 Unless the court for cause shown directs otherwise, the estate of each minor or the custodial account of each minor shall be accounted for separately.

 Note: Rule 2.3 is substantively similar to former Rule 6.2, except that Rule 2.3 now also expressly encompasses the Account of a minor's custodial account.

Rule 2.4. Petition for Adjudication/Statement of Proposed Distribution; Virtual Representation.
 (a) A petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution shall be filed with the clerk at the time of filing an Account.

 (b) In addition to other information required by the form, the petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution shall set forth the name of each interested party (whether sui juris or not) who is not receiving notice of the filing of the Account and the filing of the petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution because another individual or entity is proposed to represent such interested party pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. § 751(6) or §§ 7721—7726, and shall set forth additional facts as to the following:

 (1) a statement of the interested party's interest in the property; and

 (2) for representation being proposed pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. § 751(6),

 (i) a statement that the interested party is not sui juris or is unborn, unknown or unascertained; and

 (ii) one of the following:

 (A) a statement that the proposed representative has an interest in the property similar to that of the interested party who is not sui juris or is unborn, unknown or unascertained; or

 (B) a statement that the proposed representative is the sui juris living ancestor of the interested party who is not sui juris or is unborn, unknown or unascertained and that such living sui juris ancestor has an interest in the property that is not adverse to that of the interested party who is not sui juris or is unborn, unknown or unascertained; and

 (3) for representation in trust matters being proposed pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. §§ 7721—7726,

 (i) an explanation about how the interested party's interest in the property can be adequately represented by the proposed representative pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. § 7723,

 (ii) a statement that with respect to the matter at issue there is no conflict of interest between the proposed representative and the interested party to be represented that will or might affect the impartiality of the proposed representative (except as provided pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. § 7723(7)); and

 (iii) one of the following:

 (A) either a statement that the proposed representative has been informed of the right to decline such representation pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. § 7725 within the time period set forth therein and has failed to inform the trustee in writing that he or she declines to be the proposed representative; or

 (B) that the proposed representative's signed consent to serve is attached as an exhibit to the petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution.

 (c) The petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution shall be accompanied by such legal paper as is required by the form.

 (d) At least one of the accountants stating the Account shall sign and verify the petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution in accordance with Rules 3.12 and 3.13.

 (e) Counsel for the accountant shall sign the petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution in accordance with and pursuant to Rule 3.12.

 Note: Although substantially modified, Rule 2.4 is derived from former Rule 6.9. One modification is to require averments for virtual representation under 20 Pa.C.S. § 751(6) generally and representation in ''trust matters'' pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. § 7721 et seq. Another substantial modification is the addition of subparagraph (e) that requires counsel to sign the petition for adjudication/statement of distribution attesting that the submitted petition for adjudication/statement of distribution accurately replicates the Model Form and subjects counsel to rules and sanctions as provided in Pa.R.C.P. Nos. 1023.1 through 1023.4. (See Rule 3.12.)

 Explanatory Comment: The Supreme Court has adopted form petitions for adjudication/statements of proposed distribution of a decedent's estate, trust, guardian of an incapacitated person's estate, guardian of a minor's estate, and the estate of a principal stated by an agent under a power of attorney. These form petitions for adjudication/statements of proposed distribution are the exclusive forms for adjudicating an Account, and consequently, the local court and clerk must accept these statewide forms and may not accept or allow any other forms previously permitted under local rules. The exclusive statewide form petitions for adjudication/statements of proposed distribution appear in the Appendix and are available electronically at www.pacourts.us/forms under the For-the-Public category.

 Cover sheets or checklists may be required by local rule as permitted by Rule 1.8(c).

Rule 2.5. Notice of Account Filing.
 (a) No Account shall be confirmed or statement of proposed distribution approved unless the accountant has given written notice of the filing of the Account as provided in subparagraph (d) of this Rule to the following, as applicable:

 (1) every unpaid claimant who has given written notice of his or her claim to the accountant or who has performed any action that is the equivalent of giving written notice as provided in 20 Pa.C.S. §§ 3384 or 7755;

 (2) any other individual or entity with an asserted claim known to the accountant that is not shown in either the Account or the petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution as being either paid in full or to be paid in full;

 (3) any other individual or entity known to the accountant to have or claim an interest in the estate or trust as a beneficiary, heir, or next of kin, except for those legatees or claimants whose legacies or claims have been satisfied in full as reflected in the Account or will be satisfied in full as proposed in the petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution; and

 (4) For an Account where a charitable interest is involved, refer to Rule 4.4.

 (b) Notice to an individual or entity shall be given in accordance with Rule 4.2; provided, however, that if the individual or entity is represented by counsel who has entered his or her appearance in accordance with Rule 1.7(a), notice shall be given to counsel and the individual or entity.

 (c) If the proposed distribution is to an estate or trust and a charity is a ''qualified beneficiary,'' as defined in 20 Pa.C.S. § 7703, of that recipient estate or trust, then notice shall be given to the Attorney General on behalf of the charitable beneficiary. If the proposed distribution is to an estate or trust and any one of the accountants stating the Account is a personal representative or a trustee of the recipient estate or trust, then notice shall also be given to the beneficiaries of the estate or trust, to the extent known.

 (d) Written notice, as provided in subparagraph (a) of this Rule, shall be mailed at least 20 days prior to the audit in those counties having a separate Orphans' Court Division or 20 days prior to the date by which objections must be filed in all other counties, and the written notice shall state the date of the audit or the date by which objections must be filed, and the time and place of the audit, if one is to be held, to the extent then known. If an audit is to be held and the time and place of the audit is not known at the time the notice is mailed, the notice shall state that the time and place of the audit will be provided upon request. A copy of the Account, petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution, and any legal paper filed therewith shall be sent with the notice, unless the recipient of the notice is a trust beneficiary who is not a ''qualified beneficiary'' as defined in 20 Pa.C.S. § 7703, or unless the court orders otherwise in a particular matter.

 (e) If the audit of an Account is continued or the date for filing written objections is extended, additional notice shall be mailed at least 20 days prior to the date of the continued audit or the new date for filing written objections to all of those who initially received notice of the Account's filing. The additional notice shall state the date of the continued audit or the date by which objections must be filed, and the time and place of the continued audit, if one is to be held, to the extent then known. If the time and place of the continued audit is not known at the time the additional notice is mailed, the additional notice shall state that the time and place of the continued audit will be provided upon request.

 (f) All notices and additional notices shall be sent by first-class United States mail, postage prepaid. Service by mail is complete upon mailing.

 (g) A certificate of service and a copy of the notice shall be appended to the petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution or filed with the clerk prior to the audit or continued audit date, in those counties having a separate Orphans' Court Division, or by the date when objections must be filed in all other counties.

 (h) The notice shall contain the information provided in subparagraphs (1), (2), and (3), as applicable, and, in all cases, shall contain a statement as provided in subparagraph (4):

 (1) the accountant's position on any known dispute or interpretation question, together with a copy of any instrument or material parts thereof containing any provision which forms the basis of the dispute or question;

 (2) the accountant's understanding of the nature of each contested or unpaid claim, a detailed explanation that specifically identifies the claim, whether the claim is admitted or contested, and if admitted, why the claim is not being paid in full;

 (3) if the Account and petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution is not sent with the notice pursuant to subparagraph (d) of this Rule, the notice shall state the amount of all compensation paid or payable to the accountant, all attorneys' fees paid or payable, and that copies of the Account and petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution are available upon request; and

 (4) that any recipient of the notice who objects to any transaction shown in the Account, any interpretation or position taken by the accountant, or to any payment, failure to pay, distribution proposed, or any other aspect of the petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution must file written objections in accordance with Rule 2.7 with the clerk on or before the audit date in those counties holding an audit and by a specified date in all other counties, and if there is no such objection, then no action need be taken as such recipient will be deemed to have approved the Account, as stated, and agreed with the accountant's position on any dispute or question as set forth in the petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution, if any, and with the accountant's proposed disbursements and distribution.

 Note: Although substantially modified, Rule 2.5 is derived from former Rule 6.3.

 Explanatory Comment: Pursuant to the cross-references to 20 Pa.C.S. §§ 3384 and 7755, notice of the claim given to accountant's counsel of record is notice to the accountant. See 20 Pa.C.S. § 3384(b)(4). If the court is inclined not to agree with accountant's position, interpretation or proposed disbursements and distribution, best practice would be for the court to direct the accountant to notify the interested parties of the court's position and what additional action must be taken by any interested party who objects to the court's position.

Rule 2.6. Filing with the Clerk.
 All Accounts shall be filed with the clerk.

 Note: Rule 2.6 is derived from what was formerly Rule 6.6. Former Rule 6.4 regarding the time for filing the first Account of the personal representative has been deleted as it is codified in 20 Pa.C.S. § 3501.1.

Rule 2.7. Objections to Accounts or Petitions for Adjudication/Statements of Proposed Distribution.
 (a) Objections to an Account and/or a petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution shall be filed with the clerk on or before the time and date of the audit in those counties holding an audit, and by a specified date in all other counties, with a copy sent by first-class United States mail, postage prepaid, to the accountant or the accountant's counsel, if represented, and to each interested party and claimant who received the notice pursuant to Rule 2.5, to the extent known.

 (b) Objections shall be in writing, with consecutively numbered paragraphs, signed by counsel, or if not represented by counsel, then by all the objectors in accordance with Rule 3.12. Objections shall be verified by at least one of the objectors in accordance with Rule 3.13.

 (c) Each objection shall:

 (1) be specific as to description and amount;

 (2) raise one issue of law or fact, but if there are several objections relating to the same issue, all such objections shall be included in the same paragraph as subparts; and

 (3) briefly set forth the reason or reasons in support thereof.

 (d) The court may extend the time for filing objections.

 Note: Although substantially modified, Rule 2.7 is derived from former Rule 6.10.

 Explanatory Comment: If the notice received by the objector has a service list appended to it setting forth the name and address of each interested party who received the notice under Rule 2.5, the objector must mail his or her objections to every name and address appearing on the service list.

Rule 2.8. Pleadings Allowed After Objections are Filed.
 (a) Answers to objections, preliminary objections to objections, and answers to preliminary objections are permitted, but a party does not waive any rights by failing to file any of the foregoing. If an answer to objections is filed, no responsive pleading to the answer is permitted.

 (b) Preliminary objections to objections shall be limited to lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter and lack of standing.

 (c) If filed, answers to objections, preliminary objections to objections, and answers to preliminary objections must be filed within 20 days after service of the applicable preceding pleading, with a copy served upon the accountant, if applicable, and to each interested party and claimant who received the notice pursuant to Rule 2.5, or to his or her counsel, if represented.

 (d) The court may summarily decide preliminary objections to objections and may do so prior to the filing of an answer to the preliminary objections.

 Note: Rule 2.8 has no counterpart in former Orphans' Court Rules.

 Explanatory Comment: Preliminary objections to objections are limited in the grounds that may be raised. Insufficient specificity, failure to conform to law, and the inclusion of scandalous or impertinent matter, inter alia, are not properly raised as preliminary objections to objections. (Cf. Rule 3.9 and Pa.R.C.P. No. 1028).

Rule 2.9. Confirmation of Accounts; Awards.
 (a) An Account shall be confirmed or petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution approved when an adjudication or a decree of distribution is issued by the court and docketed by the clerk, expressly confirming the Account or approving the petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution and specifying, or indicating by reference to the petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution, the names of those to whom the balance available for distribution is awarded and the amount or share awarded to each.

 (b) An adjudication confirming an Account discharges the fiduciaries as to those transactions set forth in the Account.

 (c) The practice related to Schedules of Distribution shall be prescribed by local rule.

 Note: Rule 2.9 is substantively similar to former Rule 6.11(a). Former Rule 6.11(b) has been deleted.

Rule 2.10. Foreign Heirs and Unknown Dis- tributees.
 (a) If it appears that the decedent may have heirs in a foreign country but their location, existence or identity is unknown, the accountant or his or her counsel shall notify the consulate of the country, prior to audit, of the facts indicating that the decedent may have had heirs in that country.

 (b) Whenever the existence, identity or whereabouts of a distributee is unknown, or it appears that a distributee may not have the actual benefit, use, enjoyment or control of the money or other property if awarded to him or her, or the court is requested to withhold distribution or to make an award other than to the distributee or his or her nominee, the accountant or his or her counsel shall submit to the court or auditor, as the case may be, a written report outlining the investigation made and the facts relevant thereto. The report shall be in such form and may be filed at such place and time as shall be prescribed by local rule or order of the court.

 Note: With only minor modifications, Rule 2.10 is substantively similar to former Rules 13.2 and 13.3. Former Rule 13.1 has been deleted.

Rule 2.11. Appointment of Official Examiners.
 The court, by local rule or order in a particular matter, may appoint an official examiner who shall examine the assets held by or the transactions of any fiduciary.

 Note: Rule 2.11 is substantively identical to former Rule 9.1. The appointment and conduct of Auditors and Masters is provided for in Chapter IX.

3.3.	Contents of All Pleadings; General and Specific Averments.
3.4.	Form of Petition; Exhibits; Consents; Signing and Verification.
3.5.	Mode of Proceeding on Petition.
Rule 3.1. Petitions Generally.
 Matters may be raised before the court by written petition filed with the clerk in conformity with these Rules. Petitions for adjudication/statements of proposed distribution shall be governed by Chapter II.

 Note: Rule 3.1 has no counterpart in former Orphans' Court Rules.

 Explanatory Comment: The filing of an Account provides the procedure for raising questions related to the administration or distribution of an estate or trust, including a guardianship or minor's estate as well as a decedent's estate. Application to the Orphans' Court Division may also be commenced by a petition that is verified or attested by an affidavit. See 20 Pa.C.S. §§ 761, 762.

Rule 3.2. Headings; Captions.
 Pleadings shall include the docket number, if one has been assigned to the matter by the clerk or Register, and shall include a heading identifying the type of pleading filed, and in the case of a petition, identifying the nature of the relief requested therein. In those counties having a separate Orphans' Court Division, pleadings shall be captioned ''Court of Common Pleas of ______ County, Orphans' Court Division''.

 Note: Rule 3.2 has no counterpart in former Orphans' Court Rules, but is derived from Pa.R.C.P. No. 1018.

Rule 3.3. Contents of All Pleadings; General and Specific Averments.
 The following rules shall apply to all pleadings:

 (a) Every pleading shall be divided into consecutively numbered paragraphs. Each paragraph shall contain as far as practicable only one material allegation.

 (b) The material facts on which a cause of action or defense is based shall be stated in a concise and summary form.

 (c) Averments of fraud or mistake shall be averred with particularity. Malice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of mind may be averred generally.

 (d) In pleading the performance or occurrence of conditions precedent, it is sufficient to aver generally that all conditions precedent have been performed or have occurred. A denial of such performance or occurrence shall be made specifically and with particularity.

 (e) In pleading an official document or official act, it is sufficient to identify it by reference and aver that the document was issued or the act done in compliance with law.

 (f) In pleading a judgment, order or decision of a domestic or foreign court, judicial or administrative tribunal, or board, commission or officer, it is sufficient to aver the judgment, order or decision without setting forth matter showing jurisdiction to render it.

 (g) Averments of time and place shall be specifically stated.

 (h) Any part of a pleading may be incorporated by reference in another part of the same pleading or in another pleading in the same action. A party may incorporate by reference any matter of record in any state or federal court of record whose records are within the county in which the action is pending, or any matter which is recorded or transcribed verbatim in the office of the prothonotary, clerk of any court of record, recorder of deeds or Register of such county.

 (i) When any claim or defense is based upon an agreement, the pleading shall state specifically if the agreement is oral or written.

 (j) When any claim or defense is based upon a writing, the pleading shall have attached to it a copy of the writing, or the material part thereof, but if the writing or copy is not accessible to the pleader, it is sufficient so to state, identifying the reason therefor, and setting forth the substance of the writing.

 Note: Rule 3.3 has no counterpart in former Orphans' Court Rules, but is derived from Pa.R.C.P. No. 206.1(c) and Pa.R.C.P. No. 1019.

Rule 3.4. Form of Petition; Exhibits; Consents; Signing and Verification.
 (a) In addition to the requirements of Rules 3.2 and 3.3, a petition shall set forth:

 (1) a title indicating briefly the purpose of the petition;

 (2) a concise statement of the facts relied upon to establish the court's jurisdiction and to justify the relief requested;

 (3) the questions of law with respect to the petition and the relief requested;

 (4) if the trust includes a charitable interest for which notice is required under Rule 4.4, whether the Office of the Attorney General has been given notice, whether the Office of the Attorney General has issued a statement of no objection to the petition, or the reason for failing to give the Office of the Attorney General notice;

 (5) the names and addresses of every interested party who has an interest in the matter that is the subject of the petition;

 (6) the name of any individual who is an interested party but is not sui juris, along with the following information:

 (i) the name and address of the guardian, agent under power of attorney, or another individual being proposed to represent such individual, if any;

 (ii) if such individual is a minor and no guardian has been appointed for such minor's estate, the minor's age, the names and addresses of his or her parents, and the individual with whom he or she resides or the facility at which he or she resides; and

 (iii) if the non-sui juris individual is proposed to be represented in the matter at issue by another individual or entity pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. §§ 751(6) or 7721—7726, then subparagraph (7) of this Rule shall also apply;

 (7) the name of each interested party (whether sui juris or not) who is not receiving notice of the filing of the petition because another individual or entity is proposed to represent such interested party pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. §§ 751(6) or 7721—7726, and shall set forth additional facts as to the following:

 (i) a statement of the interested party's interest in the property; and

 (ii) for representation being proposed pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. § 751(6),

 (A) a statement that the interested party is not sui juris or is unborn, unknown or unascertained; and

 (B) one of the following:

 (I) a statement that the proposed representative has an interest in the property similar to that of the interested party who is not sui juris or is unborn, unknown or unascertained; or

 (II) a statement that the proposed representative is the sui juris living ancestor of the interested party who is not sui juris or is unborn, unknown or unascertained and that such living sui juris ancestor has an interest in the property that is not adverse to that of the interested party who is not sui juris or is unborn, unknown or unascertained; and

 (iii) for representation in trust matters being proposed pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. §§ 7721—7726,

 (A) an explanation about how the interested party's interest in the property can be adequately represented by the proposed representative pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. § 7723,

 (B) a statement that with respect to the matter at issue there is no conflict of interest between the proposed representative and the interested party to be represented that will or might affect the impartiality of the proposed representative (except as provided pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. § 7723(7)); and

 (C) one of the following:

 (I) either a statement that the proposed representative has been informed of the right to decline such representation pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. § 7725 within the time period set forth therein and has failed to inform the trustee in writing that he or she declines to be the proposed representative; or

 (II) that the proposed representative's signed consent to serve is attached as an exhibit to such petition; and

 (8) a prayer for the relief desired.

 (b) A proposed form of decree bearing the caption of the case and setting forth the relief requested in the prayer of the petition shall be attached to the front of the petition. In the case of a petition requiring a citation under Rule 3.5(a), a proposed form of preliminary decree for the issuance of the citation to the interested parties, subject to subparagraph (a)(7) of this Rule, shall also be attached to the front of the petition.

 (c) Petitioner shall attach to the petition such exhibits, consents or approvals as may be required by these Rules, applicable statute, or local rule. If the petitioner is unable to attach any necessary exhibit, consent or approval, the petition shall so state and identify the reason therefor.

 (d) The petition shall be verified by at least one of the petitioners in accordance with Rule 3.13 and signed by counsel, or if not represented by counsel, then signed by all the petitioners in accordance with Rule 3.12.

 Note: Rule 3.4 is based upon former Rule 3.3 and Rule 3.4, but has been modified to require averments for virtual representation under 20 Pa.C.S. § 751(6) generally and representation in ''trust matters'' pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. § 7721 et seq. Another modification is the addition of subparagraph (d) that requires petitioner's counsel to sign the petition, or all of the petitioners to sign the petition, if unrepresented, thereby subjecting these signatories to rules and sanctions as provided in Pa.R.C.P. Nos. 1023.1 through 1023.4. (See Rule 3.12.)

Rule 3.5. Mode of Proceeding on Petition.
 (a) Citation Practice.

 (1) When personal jurisdiction is required and has not previously been obtained or conferred by statute, or when a citation is otherwise required by statute, the petition shall include a preliminary decree for the issuance of a citation to those interested parties for whom a citation is necessary to show cause why the relief requested in the petition should not be granted.

 (2) The citation to obtain personal jurisdiction and a copy of the petition shall be served upon each cited party at least 20 days before the date when a responsive pleading is due, in the same manner as service of original process under Pa.R.C.P. Nos. 402 through 404, Pa.R.C.P. No. 420, and Pa.R.C.P. Nos. 422 through 424 inclusive. If service cannot be made under the foregoing rules, the court may order service by publication in accordance with Pa.R.C.P. No. 430. Service of a citation as original process shall not be permitted by electronic means, unless agreed to by the respondent.

 (3) If the citation is not being issued in order to obtain personal jurisdiction over an interested party, the petition and the citation may be served by first-class United States mail, postage prepaid, at least 20 days before the date when a responsive pleading is due.

 (4) If the citation and petition are not served at least 20 days before the date when a responsive pleading is due, the court, upon request, may authorize the reissuance of the citation.

 (5) Once the citation to obtain personal jurisdiction has been served upon the cited party by original process in accordance with subparagraph (a)(2), then notice of a rescheduled return date or any other rescheduled date for filing a responsive pleading or appearing before the court may be served by first-class United States mail, postage prepaid, at least 20 days before such rescheduled date.

 (6) If an interested party (whether sui juris or not) is represented by another, the citation and petition shall be served upon the interested party's representative(s) pursuant to Rule 4.2.

 (7) Proof of service of the citation shall be filed with the clerk on or before the date when a responsive pleading is due.

 (8) Each interested party identified in the citation, or such interested party's representative identified in the citation, may file a responsive pleading in accordance with these Rules on or before the date provided in the citation.

 (b) Notice Practice.

 (1) In all cases where personal jurisdiction is not required or has been previously obtained, or conferred by statute, the petitioner shall, either in advance of filing or contemporaneously therewith, provide a copy of the petition to the interested parties identified in the petition. The petition shall have affixed to its first page a notice to plead that shall be substantially in the following form:

To: ______
You are hereby notified to file a written response to the (name of pleading) within twenty (20) days from the date of notice or on or before the date when the pleading is to be filed, whichever is later, or the court may deem that you have no objection to the relief requested therein and may grant such relief without further notice to you.
 (2) A certificate of service, listing the names and addresses of those individuals and entities receiving notice of the filing of the petition, shall be appended to, or filed contemporaneously with, the petition.

 (3) If an interested party (whether sui juris or not) is not receiving notice of the filing of the petition because he or she is represented by another, a copy of the petition shall be sent in accordance with subparagraph (b)(1) to the interested party's representative pursuant to Rule 4.2.

 (c) Consents/Statements of No Objection; Joinders.

 No citation or notice to plead is required where all individuals and/or entities identified in the petition as interested parties (or any representative thereof) satisfy one of the following:

 (1) they are named petitioners in the petition;

 (2) they filed joinders to the petition; or

 (3) they signed a document, that is attached to the petition as an exhibit, consenting to or stating that they have no objection to the relief requested in the petition.

 Note: Subparagraphs (a) and (b) of Rule 3.5 are derived from former Rule 3.5. The final sentence of subparagraph (a)(2) is identical to former Rule 3.7(h)(1); it merely has been relocated to this section. Subparagraphs (c) and (d) of this Rule have no counterpart in former Orphans' Court Rules.

 Explanatory Comment: Personal jurisdiction is conferred by statute in certain circumstances. See e.g., 20 Pa.C.S. § 7712. A sheriff does not need to serve the citation issued by the clerk; instead, any adult person may serve the citation and file the proof of service in accordance with subparagraph (a)(7) of this Rule 3.5. See 20 Pa.C.S. § 765. If a citation is not being issued with the petition, then the petition must be endorsed with a notice to plead. See Rule 3.5(b) and Pa.R.C.P. No. 1026. The court, by local rule or by order in a particular matter, may establish a procedure for rules to show cause as provided in Pa.R.C.P. No. 206.4 et seq.

Part B. Responsive Pleadings
Rule

3.6.	Pleadings Allowed After Petition.
3.7.	Time for Filing and Service of Responsive Pleadings.
3.8.	Headings of Responsive Pleadings.
3.9.	Preliminary Objections.
3.10.	Denials; Effect of Failure to Deny.
3.11.	Answer with New Matter.
Rule 3.6. Pleadings Allowed After Petition.
 Pleadings allowed after the filing of a petition are limited to:

 (a) an answer that can include new matter;

 (b) a reply, if an answer contains new matter;

 (c) preliminary objections to the petition as permitted by Rule 3.9;

 (d) an answer to preliminary objections; and

 (e) a petition to join one or more persons as parties to the proceeding and an answer thereto.

 Note: Rule 3.6 has no counterpart in former Orphans' Court Rules, but is based, in part, on Pa.R.C.P. No. 1017.

 Explanatory Comment: Any interested party may file a new petition bringing a new issue or dispute before the court or seeking alternative relief in the same trust or estate. Motions are permitted in Orphans' Court Division, and this Rule 3.6 does not prohibit or limit motions practice.

Rule 3.7. Time for Filing and Service of Responsive Pleadings.
 (a) Unless the court orders otherwise, each interested party identified in the petition, or such interested party's representative identified in the petition, may file a responsive pleading in accordance with these Rules within 20 days of the date of notice or the date of the filing, whichever is later. A party residing outside of the United States shall have 60 days, rather than 20 days, within which to file a responsive pleading to the citation or the petition initiating the proceeding.

 (b) A copy of the responsive pleading shall be sent to the petitioner or his or her counsel, if represented, and all interested parties identified in the petition or counsel representing an interested party if so identified in the petition or in a subsequent pleading. A certificate of service, listing the names and addresses of those individuals and entities receiving a copy of the responsive pleading shall be appended to, or filed contemporaneously with, the responsive pleading.

 (c) A notice to plead in substantially the form provided in Rule 3.5(b)(1) shall be affixed to the first page of an answer that contains new matter and to the first page of preliminary objections which aver a fact that is not contained in the petition.

 (d) Regardless of the residency of any interested party, each subsequent pleading shall be filed within 20 days after service of the preceding pleading, but no pleading need be filed unless the preceding pleading included a notice to plead that complies with the requirements of Rule 3.5(b)(1).

 Note: Rule 3.7 is new, but is derived from Pa.R.C.P. No. 1026.

 Explanatory Comment: The court, by local rule, may establish procedures for the disposition of matters after the pleadings are closed.

Rule 3.8. Headings of Responsive Pleadings.
 All responsive pleadings shall contain a heading identifying the name of the pleading to which it is responding.

 Note: Rule 3.8 has no counterpart in former Orphans' Court Rules.

Rule 3.9. Preliminary Objections.
 (a) General. Preliminary objections may be filed to any petition by any interested party or the interested party's representative.

 (b) Grounds for Preliminary Objections. Preliminary objections filed to any petition under the Rules of Chapter III are limited to the following grounds:

 (1) lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action or lack of jurisdiction over the person, improper venue, or improper form of service;

 (2) failure of a pleading to conform to law or rule of court or inclusion of scandalous or impertinent matter;

 (3) insufficient specificity in a pleading;

 (4) legal insufficiency of a pleading (demurrer);

 (5) lack of standing or lack of capacity to sue, nonjoinder of a necessary party, or misjoinder of a cause of action; and

 (6) pendency of a prior action or agreement for alternative dispute resolution.

 (c) Form. All preliminary objections shall be raised at one time in one pleading, shall state specifically the grounds relied upon, and may be inconsistent.

 (d) Disposition of Preliminary Objections.

 (1) A party may file an amended pleading, without consent of any other party and without leave of court, within 20 days after service of the preliminary objections. If a party files an amended pleading, the preliminary objections to the original pleading shall be deemed moot.

 (2) In all other instances, the court shall determine promptly all preliminary objections. If an issue of fact is raised, the court shall consider evidence by deposition or otherwise.

 (e) Pleadings Allowed Subsequent to the Disposition of Preliminary Objections.

 (1) If the preliminary objections are overruled, the party who filed the preliminary objections shall have the right to file an answer within 20 days after entry of the order overruling the preliminary objections or within such other time as the court shall direct.

 (2) If the filing of an amended petition or a new petition is allowed or required, it shall be filed within 20 days after entry of the order concerning such amended or new petition or within such other time as the court shall direct.

 (3) New preliminary objections may be filed to any amended or new petition in accordance with this Rule.

 Note: Rule 3.9 has no counterpart in former Orphans' Court Rules, but is derived from Pa.R.C.P. No. 1028.

 Explanatory Comment: Preliminary objections raising an issue under subparagraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(4), and in some instances (b)(1), may be determined from the facts of record so that further evidence is not required. In such situations, the court may summarily decide preliminary objections prior to the filing of an answer.

 Preliminary objections raising an issue under subparagraphs (b)(5) and (b)(6), and in some instances (b)(1), cannot be determined from the facts of record. In such situations, if the preliminary objections are not endorsed with a notice to plead in the form required by Rule 3.5(b)(1), no reply will be required under Rule 3.10, and the preliminary objections will be overruled.

 Pleadings may be amended only in accordance with subparagraphs (d)(1), (e)(2) or Rule 3.14.

 For preliminary objections to Objections to an Account, petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution or a notice, cf. Rule 2.8(b) for a more limited scope of permitted preliminary objections.

Rule 3.10. Denials; Effect of Failure to Deny.
 (a) A responsive pleading shall admit or deny each averment of fact in the preceding pleading or any part thereof. Admissions and denials in a responsive pleading shall refer specifically to the paragraph in which the averment admitted or denied is set forth. A party denying only a part of an averment shall specify so much of it as is admitted and shall deny the remainder.

 (b) Averments in a pleading to which a responsive pleading is required are admitted when not denied specifically or by necessary implication. A general denial or a demand for proof, except as provided by subparagraph (c) of this Rule, shall have the effect of an admission.

 (c) A statement by a party that after reasonable investigation the party is without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of an averment shall have the effect of a denial.

 (d) Averments in a pleading to which no responsive pleading is required shall be deemed to be denied.

 (e) A responsive pleading shall be signed by counsel, or if not represented by counsel, then by all the respondents in accordance with Rule 3.12. A responsive pleading that admits or denies any averment of fact shall be verified by at least one of the respondents in accordance with Rule 3.13.

 Note: Rule 3.10 has no counterpart in former Orphans' Court Rules, but is derived from Pa.R.C.P. No. 1029.

 Explanatory Comment: Reliance on subparagraph (c) does not excuse a failure to admit or deny a factual allegation when it is clear that the respondent must know whether a particular allegation is true or false. Cf. Cercone v. Cercone, 386 A.2d 1, 4 (Pa. Super. 1978).

Rule 3.11. Answer with New Matter.
 All applicable affirmative defenses shall be pleaded in the answer under the heading ''New Matter.'' A party may set forth as new matter any other material facts that are not merely denials of the averments of the preceding pleading.

 Note: Rule 3.11 has no counterpart in former Orphans' Court Rules, but is derived from Pa.R.C.P. No. 1030.

Part C. Pleadings in General
Rule

3.12.	Signing.
3.13.	Verification.
3.14.	Amendment.
3.15.	Pleading More Than One Cause of Action; Alternative Pleadings.
Rule 3.12. Signing.
 (a) Counsel who has entered an appearance for a party pursuant to Rule 1.7(a) shall sign every pleading and any brief or memorandum of law and shall include counsel's name and address. A party not represented by any counsel of record shall sign every pleading and any brief or memorandum of law and shall include the party's name, an address where legal paper may be served, and a telephone number.

 (b) If the legal paper includes a facsimile telephone number and/or email address, that party or his or her counsel agrees to accept service of legal paper by transmission of a facsimile copy or by electronic transmission.

 (c) By signing a legal paper, the party and counsel are subject to Pa.R.C.P. Nos. 1023.1 through 1023.4. The court has authority to impose sanctions and grant relief in accordance with Pa.R.C.P. No. 1023.4.

 Note: Rule 3.12 has no counterpart in former Orphans' Court Rules, but subparagraphs (a) and (b) are derived from Pa.R.C.P. No. 1025. Rule 3.12(c) is based upon Pa.R.C.P. No. 1023.1 et seq.

 Explanatory Comment: The Explanatory Comments appearing after Pa.R.C.P. Nos. 1023.1 and 1023.4 are fully incorporated by reference herein.

Rule 3.13. Verification.
 (a) Every pleading shall be verified, averring as true every fact not appearing of record in the action or containing a denial of fact based upon the signer's personal knowledge or information and belief. A pleading may be verified upon personal knowledge as to a part and upon information and belief as to the remainder. The signer need not aver the source of the information or expectation of ability to prove the averment or denial at the trial.

 (b) If a pleading contains averments that are inconsistent in fact, the verification shall state that the signer has been unable after reasonable investigation to ascertain which of the inconsistent averments, specifying them, are true but that the signer has knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief that one of them is true.

 (c) The verification shall be made by one or more of the parties filing the pleading unless all the parties (1) lack sufficient knowledge or information, or (2) are outside the jurisdiction of the court and the verification of none of them can be obtained within the time allowed for filing the pleading. In such cases, the verification may be made by any person having sufficient knowledge or information and belief and shall set forth the source of the person's information as to matters not stated upon his or her own knowledge and the reason why the verification is not made by a party.

 Note: Rule 3.13 has no counterpart in former Orphans' Court Rules, but is derived from Pa.R.C.P. No. 1024.

Rule 3.14. Amendment.
 A party may amend a pleading pursuant to Rule 3.9(d)(1), or at any other time, either by written consent of all other parties filed with the clerk or by leave of court. The amended pleading may aver transactions or occurrences that have happened before or after the filing of the original pleading. An amendment may be made to conform the pleading to the evidence offered or admitted.

 Note: Rule 3.14 has no counterpart in former Orphans' Court Rules, but is derived from Pa.R.C.P. No. 1033.

 Explanatory Comment: Rule 3.9(d)(1) provides for amending a pleading after the filing of preliminary objections.

Rule 3.15. Pleading More Than One Cause of Action; Alternative Pleadings.
 (a) More than one cause of action may be stated in a pleading. Each cause of action shall be stated in a separate count, preceded by a heading, and the count shall name the parties to that cause of action and shall contain a separate request for relief.

 (b) Causes of action and defenses may be pleaded in the alternative.

 Note: Rule 3.15 has no counterpart in former Orphans' Court Rules, but is derived from Pa.R.C.P. No. 1020.

CHAPTER IV. FORMAT AND SERVICE OF LEGAL PAPER BY PARTIES AND COURT; ELECTRONIC FILING
Rule

4.1.	Format of All Legal Paper.
4.2.	Citation or Notice to Individuals and Entities.
4.3.	Service of Legal Paper Other than Citations or Notices.
4.4.	Charities—Notice to the Attorney General.
4.5.	Service of Legal Paper by Court and Clerk.
4.6.	Notice of the Date of Entry of an Adjudication or Court Order on the Docket.
4.7.	Electronic Filing.
Rule 4.1. Format of All Legal Paper.
 All legal paper filed with the clerk must conform to the following requirements:

 (a) The document shall be on 8 1/2 inch by 11 inch paper.

 (b) The document shall be prepared on white paper (except for dividers and similar sheets) of good quality.

 (c) The text must be double spaced, but quotations more than two lines long may be indented and single-spaced. Margins must be at least one inch on all four sides.

 (d) The lettering shall be clear and legible and no smaller than point 12. The lettering shall be on only one side of a page, except that exhibits and similar supporting documents may be double-sided.

 Note: Rule 4.1 has no counterpart in former Orphans' Court Rules, but is derived from Pa.R.C.P. No. 204.1.

 Explanatory Comment: Rule 4.1 governing the format of legal paper is modeled after Pa.R.C.P. No. 204.1 and thus is substantively identical to Pa.R.A.P. No. 124(a) and Pa.R.Crim.P. 575(C). See Explanatory Comment to Pa.R.C.P. No. 204.1. The goal is to foster uniformity in the formatting of legal paper filed in all judicial tribunals, regardless of the level of court or division of court; this uniformity, in turn, will promote the objective of the unified judicial system under the Constitution of 1968 and facilitate the statewide practice of law.

Rule 4.2. Citation or Notice to Individuals and Entities.
 (a) To individuals. Whenever a citation under Rule 3.5(a) is to be served or notice under Rule 2.5 or Rule 3.5(b) is to be given to an individual:

 (1) If the individual is sui juris, or if the individual has reached the age of 18 and is believed to be incapacitated (under the provisions of Chapter 55 of Title 20), but for whom no guardian is known to have been appointed by a Pennsylvania court or by the court of any other jurisdiction (including a guardian ad litem with respect to the matter at issue), then such notice or citation shall be provided:

 (i) to the individual; or

 (ii) if the individual will be represented with respect to the matter at issue by a representative under the provisions of 20 Pa.C.S. §§ 7721—7726, then such notice or citation may instead be provided to such representative, including notice as required by 20 Pa.C.S. § 7725 that each such representative may decline to act as a representative for the sui juris individual.

 (2) If the individual is not sui juris, or is unborn, unknown or unascertained, then such notice or citation shall be provided to such individual's representative with respect to the matter at issue under the provisions of 20 Pa.C.S. §§ 751(6) or 7721—7726, including notice required by 20 Pa.C.S. § 7725 that each such representative may decline to act as a representative for the individual; provided, however, that if a guardian or trustee ad litem has been appointed to represent such individual by the court having jurisdiction over the matter at issue, then such notice or citation shall also be provided to the guardian or trustee ad litem.

 (b) To entities. Whenever a citation under Rule 3.5(a) is to be served or notice under Rule 2.5 or Rule 3.5(b) is to be given to an entity, then such citation or notice shall be provided:

 (1) to the entity through the entity's duly authorized representative; or

 (2) if the entity will be represented with respect to the matter at issue by a representative under the provisions of 20 Pa.C.S. §§ 7721—7726, then such notice or citation may instead be provided to such representative, including notice as required by 20 Pa.C.S. § 7725 that each such representative may decline to act as a representative for the entity.

 (c) Counsel. If counsel has entered an appearance on behalf of an individual, entity or representative who would otherwise receive notice or a citation as provided under subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this Rule, then such notice or citation shall instead be given to counsel, except as provided in Rule 2.5(b) wherein the notice must be given to both counsel and the individual, entity or representative.

 (d) Additional service or notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the court having jurisdiction over the matter determines that the representation is or might be inadequate, then the court may in its discretion direct to whom a citation or notice shall be provided.

 Note: Rule 4.2 is derived from former Rule 5.2, but has been substantially modified to address virtual representation under 20 Pa.C.S. § 751(6) generally and representation in ''trust matters'' pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. § 7721 et seq. Cf. Rule 2.5(b) for different requirements that the notice must be mailed to the individual or entity and to counsel representing such individual or entity.

Rule 4.3. Service of Legal Paper Other than Citations or Notices.
 (a) Copies of all pleadings, and any brief or memorandum of law in connection therewith, other than notices served pursuant to Rule 2.5 or citations served pursuant to Rule 3.5(a), filed in an action or served upon any party to an action shall be served upon every other party to the action. This service shall be made:

 (1) by handing, or mailing by first-class United States mail, postage prepaid, a copy to, or leaving a copy for, each party at the address of the party's counsel of record listed on an entry of appearance or prior pleading of the party, or at such other address as a party may agree;

 (2) by transmitting a facsimile copy to the party's counsel of record as provided by subparagraph (c); or

 (3) by electronic transmission as provided in subparagraph (d).

 (b) If there is no attorney of record,

 (1) Service shall be made by handing a copy to the party or by mailing a copy to, or leaving a copy for, the party at the address listed on an entry of appearance or prior pleading or at the residence or place of business of the party, or by transmitting a facsimile copy as provided by subparagraph (c) or by electronic transmission as provided in subparagraph (d).

 (2) If such service cannot be made, service shall be made by leaving a copy at, or mailing a copy to, the last known address of the party to be served.

 (c)(1) A facsimile copy may be served if the parties agree thereto or if a facsimile telephone number is included on an entry of appearance or other legal paper previously filed with the court in the action.

 (2) A facsimile copy shall begin with a facsimile cover sheet containing:

 (i) the name, firm, address, telephone number, of both the party making service and the party served;

 (ii) the facsimile telephone number of the party making service and the facsimile telephone number to which the facsimile copy was transmitted;

 (iii) the title of the legal paper served; and

 (iv) the number of pages transmitted.

 (d) Service may be effected by electronic transmission if the parties agree thereto or if an email address is included on an entry of appearance or other legal paper previously filed with the court in the action.

 (e) Service by mail is complete upon mailing, and service by facsimile is complete when transmission is confirmed. Electronic service is complete when the legal paper is sent to the recipient's email address, or when the recipient is notified by email that a legal paper affecting the recipient has been filed and is available for review on the court's website.

 Note: Most of Rule 4.4 has no counterpart in former Orphans' Court Rules, but is based on Pa.R.C.P. No. 440 with modifications. Subparagraph (d) of this Rule is identical to former Rule 3.7(h)(2); it merely has been reformatted and relocated to this Chapter IV.

 Explanatory Comment: The Notes and Explanatory Comment appearing after Pa.R.C.P. No. 440 are fully incorporated by reference herein. Service of legal papers as provided in Rule 4.3 can occur even if the local judicial district has not implemented electronic filing.

Rule 4.4. Charities—Notice to the Attorney General.
 (a) In every court proceeding involving or affecting a charitable interest with the exception hereinafter set forth, at least 20 days advance written notice thereof shall be given to the Attorney General of the Commonwealth at the principal office in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, or to a deputy of the Attorney General designated for such purpose for the judicial district in which the proceeding is pending. The notice shall include or be accompanied by such of the following as may be appropriate:

 (1) the caption of the case;

 (2) a description of the nature of the proceeding;

 (3) the date, time and place when the matter is to be heard by the court to the extent then known;

 (4) the name of the decedent, settlor, incapacitated person or minor, if not disclosed by the caption;

 (5) a copy of the will or other instrument creating the charitable interest;

 (6) the name and address of any specific charity which may be affected by the proceeding;

 (7) if the charitable interest is a present interest, a description and the approximate market value of that interest;

 (8) if the charitable interest is a future interest and the estimated present value of the charity's future interest in the property exceeds $25,000, a brief description thereof including the conditions precedent to its vesting in enjoyment and possession, the names and ages of persons known to have interests preceding such charitable interest, and the approximate market value of the property involved;

 (9) a description of any unresolved claim and any material question of interpretation or distribution likely to be submitted for adjudication which may affect the value of the charitable interest;

 (10) the names and addresses of all fiduciaries;

 (11) the name and address of counsel for each fiduciary;

 (12) the name and address of counsel for any charity who has received notice or has appeared for the charity and the name of the charity which counsel represents; and

 (13) a copy of an Account if the proceeding involves an Account and if the charity is any one of the following:

 (i) a residuary beneficiary, including as a beneficiary of a residuary trust;

 (ii) a pecuniary legatee in an amount greater than $25,000; or

 (iii) a pecuniary legatee where the bequest has not and will not be paid in full.

 (b) Proof of service of the above notice or an acknowledgment of such notice received from the Attorney General or a deputy of the Attorney General shall be filed with the clerk in every proceeding involving a charitable interest prior to the entry of any decree.

 (c) Unless the court directs otherwise, no notice to the Attorney General or a deputy of the Attorney General shall be required with respect to a pecuniary legacy to a charity in the amount of $25,000 or less which has been or will be paid in full.

 Note: Rule 4.4 is substantively identical to former Rule 5.5.

 Explanatory Comment: See Appendix (OC-06) for form of notice under this Rule.

Rule 4.5. Service of Legal Paper by Court and Clerk.
 (a) The clerk and the court may serve all notices, opinions, and orders via electronic means where any one of the following has occurred:

 (1) the parties have agreed to receipt of legal paper by electronic transmission;

 (2) the underlying legal paper related to the notice, opinion or order was electronically filed; or

 (3) an email address appears on an entry of appearance or other legal paper previously filed with the clerk in the action.

 (b) The clerk and the court may serve all notices, opinions, and orders by facsimile in accordance with Rule 4.3(c).

 Note: Rule 4.5 is based upon former Rule 3.7(i); it has been reformatted and relocated to this Chapter IV.

 Explanatory Comment: This Rule 4.5 differs from its counterpart in former Rule 3.7(i) in several respects: first, this Rule permits the clerk and court to serve not only notices, but also opinions and orders, via electronic means as well as by facsimile; and second, it provides that the clerk and court are able to send notices, opinions, and orders via electronic means if the underlying legal paper was filed electronically. Service from the court and clerk as provided in Rule 4.5 can occur even if the local judicial district has not implemented electronic filing.

Rule 4.6. Notice of the Date of Entry of an Adjudication or Court Order on the Docket.
 (a) The clerk shall immediately give written notice of the entry of an adjudication or court order in a particular matter to each party's counsel of record or, if unrepresented, to each party. The notice shall include a copy of the adjudication or court order.

 (b) The clerk shall note in the docket the date when notice was given to the party or to his or her counsel under subparagraph (a) of this Rule.

 Note: Rule 4.6 has no counterpart in former Orphans' Court Rule, but is derived from Pa.R.C.P. No. 236.

Rule 4.7. Electronic Filing.
 (a) Authorization for Electronic Filing. A court may permit or require electronic filing of legal paper. Any court that implements electronic filing shall establish procedures governing such filing by local rule, which shall not be inconsistent with the procedures set forth herein.

 (b) Electronic Filing of Legal Paper.

 (1) If implemented by court, a filing party may file a legal paper with the clerk by means of electronic filing.

 (2) Any party may require the filing party to file the original of a legal paper or exhibit by filing a notice to file with the clerk and serving a copy of the notice upon the filing party. The filing party shall file the specified document with the clerk within 14 days after service of the notice. The court for any reason may direct any party to file the original of a legal paper or exhibit with the clerk within the time specified in the order. Upon disposition of the matter before the court, an original document may be returned to the party who filed it or retained by the court, as the court may determine.

 (c) Signature, Verification and Retention of Legal Paper.

 (1) The original legal paper shall be properly signed, and where required, verified.

 (2) The electronic filing of a legal paper constitutes a certification by the filing party that the original document was signed, and where applicable, verified.

 (3) Unless retained by the court, the filing party shall maintain the original of all documents so certified, together with any exhibits filed, for 5 years after the final disposition of the case.

 (d) Website and Filing Date.

 (1) The court shall designate a website for the electronic filing of legal paper. A user name and password shall be issued to authorized users.

 (2) The court shall provide electronic filing access at all times. The time and date of the filing shall be that registered by the court's computer system.

 (3) The court shall provide, through its website, an acknowledgement from the clerk that the filing has been processed. Such acknowledgement shall include the date and time of filing in a form which can be printed for retention by the filing party.

 (e) Delay in Filing. A filing party shall be responsible for any delay, disruption, or interruption of electronic transmission, and for the legibility of the document electronically filed, except for delays caused by the failure of the court's website. The filing party may petition the court to resolve any dispute concerning an alleged failure of the court's website.

 (f) Fees.

 (1) A filing party shall pay the fee for electronically filing a legal paper as provided by the court.

 (2) The court may assess an additional automation fee for each legal paper electronically filed which shall be used for the development, implementation, maintenance, and training in the use of the court's electronic filing system and other related uses.

 Note: Rule 4.7 is substantively identical to former Rule 3.7, but has been relocated to Chapter IV of these Rules.

 Explanatory Comment: This Rule is designed as a general enabling mechanism by which local judicial districts can, if they so choose, implement electronic filing. Implementation procedures not inconsistent with this Rule will be determined by local rules of court.

 Those jurisdictions which require e-filing must also provide the necessary technical assistance to those parties who lack the capacity to electronically file legal paper.

 Nothing in this Rule is intended to change the procedural requirements of Orphans' Court practice, as embodied in the statutes and rules of court. Rather, this Rule is intended to facilitate the delivery of legal paper to the court and the parties, as well as to reduce record management burdens in the office of the clerk. The terms ''electronic filing,'' ''filing party,'' and ''legal paper'' are defined in Rule 1.3.

 The court may, from time to time, modify the approved electronic filing system to take into consideration the costs and security of the system and the maintenance of electronic data and images.

 (a) Commencement of Action. An action for declaratory judgment shall be commenced by petition and citation directed to the interested parties.

 (b) Contents of Petition. In addition to the requirements provided by the Rules in Chapter III, the petition shall contain sufficient averments to entitle petitioner to the declaratory relief requested under the Pennsylvania Declaratory Judgments Act, 42 Pa.C.S. § 7531 et seq., including:

 (2) the question of law, if any, with respect to which declaratory relief is requested;

 (c) Exhibits. A copy of the will, trust, other governing instrument, or any other document to be construed shall be attached to the petition as an exhibit.

 Note: Rule 5.1 has no counterpart in former Orphans' Court Rules, but is based upon Philadelphia Local Rule 1.2.P.

Rule 5.2. Family Exemption.
 (a) Contents of Petition. In addition to the requirements provided by the Rules in Chapter III, a petition for a family exemption shall set forth the following:

 (1) facts establishing a prima facie right of the petitioner to the exemption;

 (2) whether allowance of the claim is being requested prior to the confirmation or audit of the Account;

 (3) a description of the property claimed; and

 (4) if the exemption is claimed from real estate and a valuation has not been agreed upon by all interested parties, the nomination of two appraisers for appointment by the court to appraise the same.

 (b) Exhibits. A copy of the qualifications and credentials of the two appraisers nominated in the petition for appointment by the court shall be attached to the petition as exhibits.

 (c) Award by Consent. The court may, at the request of the petitioner, award in distribution specific real estate included in the Account in satisfaction of, or on account of, the family exemption without compliance with the procedure outlined in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this Rule if all interested parties agree in writing that the petitioner is entitled to the family exemption and to the valuation at which such real estate is to be awarded.

 Note: Rule 5.2 is based upon former Rule 12.1.

Rule 5.3. Intestate Share to Surviving Spouse from Real Estate.
 (a) Contents of Petition. When no Account is filed and all or part of the spouse's intestate share under 20 Pa.C.S. § 2102 is claimed from real estate, the claim shall be presented by petition, which shall conform to the requirements provided by the Rules in Chapter III, and shall set forth the following:

 (1) facts establishing a prima facie right of the spouse to the statutory intestate share;

 (2) a description of the property claimed; and

 (3) if the exemption is claimed from real estate and a valuation has not been agreed upon by all interested parties, the nomination of two appraisers for appointment by the court to appraise the same.

 (b) Exhibits. A copy of the qualifications and credentials of the two appraisers nominated in the petition for appointment by the court shall be attached to the petition as exhibits.

 (c) Award by Consent. The court may, at the request of the surviving spouse, award specific real estate in satisfaction of, or on account of, the spouse's statutory intestate share without compliance with the procedure outlined in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this Rule if all interested parties agree in writing that the surviving spouse is entitled to the statutory share and to the valuation at which such real estate is to be awarded.

 Note: Rule 5.3 is based upon former Rule 12.2.

 Explanatory Comment: Deletion of specific reference to the former statutory allowance of $10,000.00 increased to $30,000.00 allows greater flexibility. The Rule would not need to be amended in the future if the statutory amount should be further increased. With the broader language employed there is no longer any need to refer to the specific statutory provisions. As amended, the Rule recognizes the present practice of making the award of real estate in satisfaction of the spouse's allowance a part of the distribution decree when a court accounting is filed. While this Rule will be employed only in a minimum of instances for the foregoing reason and also because of the availability of § 3546 of Title 20, it, nevertheless, is considered advisable to preserve it in its altered form as a guide when it is to be employed.

Rule 5.4. Revocation, Vacating or Extension of Time for Filing of Surviving Spouse's Election.
 (a) Contents of Petition. In addition to the requirements provided by the Rules in Chapter III, a petition to revoke or vacate an election of a surviving spouse to take against the will and other conveyances of the decedent shall set forth the following:

 (3) the name, address and relationship, if known, of the other interested parties and the nature and the extent of each of their interests;

 (5) a description and valuation of the decedent's real and personal property affected by the election;

 (6) the date and manner of executing the election desired to be revoked or vacated and whether the same has been recorded, registered or filed, and if so, the date and place thereof;

 (7) whether the surviving spouse has made or executed and delivered at any place an election contrary to that desired to be revoked or vacated, and whether that election has been recorded, registered or filed, and if so, the date and place thereof;

 (8) the facts relied upon to justify the revocation or vacating of the election; and

 (c) Notice of the filing of any petition under this Rule shall be provided to the personal representative of decedent's estate in accordance with Rule 3.5(b)(1).

 (b) The same person may be appointed as guardian ad litem and trustee ad litem and may be appointed for more than one non-sui juris individual when the interests to be represented are not conflicting.

 (c) Contents of Petition. The request for the appointment of guardian ad litem and trustee ad litem may be made in one petition. In addition to the requirements provided by the Rules in Chapter III, the petition shall set forth the following:

 (5) if the petition is filed due to the death of the minor's parent or legal guardian, or if the minor is to receive property under a will, deed or other written instrument conveying property whether the petitioner knows if the parent, legal guardian or decedent appointed a guardian for the minor in his or her will, deed or any other written instrument, and if so, the name of such proposed guardian;

 (6) that the minor has no guardian presently appointed or that a guardian already appointed has died or has been discharged or removed by the court, together with the date of such death, discharge or removal and a reference to the court order discharging or removing the previously appointed guardian;

 (c) If the minor is fourteen years of age or older, the minor shall appear in court at the time of the hearing, if any.

 Note: Rule 5.6 is derived from former Rule 12.5.

 Explanatory Comment: In a change from former Rule 12.5, Rule 5.6 requires separate petitions for each minor even if the same person is proposed as the guardian of the estates or persons of several minors. Separate Accounts must be filed for the estate of each minor. See Rule 2.3. Additionally, petitioner must attach a copy of any known written instrument that appoints a guardian to receive property or proceeds on behalf of a minor. See 20 Pa.C.S. § 5115.

 Note: Rule 5.7 is based upon former Rule 12.6.

 Explanatory Comment: See 20 Pa.C.S. § 7764.

 Note: Rule 5.8 is based upon former Rule 12.7.

 Explanatory Comment: Pursuant to Rule 2.9(b), an adjudication of an Account discharges the fiduciaries as to the transactions set forth in the adjudicated Account.

Rule 5.9. Partition.
 In addition to the requirements provided by the Rules in Chapter III, a petition for partition shall set forth the following:

 (a) the date of the decedent's death and whether he or she died testate or intestate, in whole or in part;

Rule 10.5. Notice to Beneficiaries and Intestate Heirs.
 (a) Within three (3) months after the grant of letters, the personal representative to whom original letters have been granted or the personal representative's counsel shall send a written notice of estate administration in the form approved by the Supreme Court to:

 (1) every person, corporation, association, entity or other party named in decedent's will as an outright beneficiary whether individually or as a class member;

 (2) the decedent's spouse and children, whether or not they are named in, or have an interest under, the will;

 (3) where there is an intestacy in whole or in part, to every person entitled to inherit as an intestate heir under Chapter 21 of Title 20;

 (4) the appointed guardian of the estate, parent or legal custodian of any beneficiary who is a minor;

 (5) the appointed guardian of the estate or, in the absence of such appointment, the institution or person with custody of any beneficiary who is an adjudicated incapacitated person;

 (6) the Attorney General on behalf of any charitable beneficiary (i) which is a residuary beneficiary, including as a beneficiary of a residuary testamentary trust; (ii) whose legacy exceeds $25,000; or (iii) whose interest in a legacy will not be paid in full;

 (7) the Attorney General on behalf of any governmental beneficiary;

 (8) the trustee of any trust which is a beneficiary; and

 (9) such other persons and in such manner as may be required by local rule.

The form of notice and certification of notice required by Rule 10.5 is set forth in the Appendix. Subparagraph (e) of this Rule is not intended to limit the inherent power of the court to impose sanctions upon a delinquent personal representative or counsel.

 Explanatory Comment: It is not the intention of this Rule to require notice beyond the degree of consanguinity entitling a person to inherit under Chapter 21 of Title 20.

Rule 10.6. Status Report by Personal Representative.
 (a) Report of Uncompleted Administration. If administration of an estate has not been completed within two years of the decedent's death, the personal representative or counsel shall file at such time, and annually thereafter until the administration is completed, a report with the Register showing the date by which the personal representative or his, her, or its counsel reasonably believes administration will be completed.

ORPHANS' COURT PROCEDURAL RULES COMMITTEE REPORT
Rescission and Replacement of Pennsylvania Orphans' Court Rules 1.1 through 13.3 and Rule 17, with Amendment of Rules 14.1 through 16.12
 Given that the last substantial revision to the Supreme Court Orphans' Court Rules occurred in November 1975, with an effective date of January 1, 1976, then-Chief Justice Ralph J. Cappy of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania approved a proposal by the Orphans' Court Procedural Rules Committee (the ''Committee'') to review and elaborate upon the skeletal collection of prior rules governing statewide practice and procedure. Publicly announcing this project on October 17, 2007, Chief Justice Cappy explained that the ''intent here is to simplify the current system and standardize governing procedures so everyone has a clearer idea of what is expected and better outcomes are realized for the citizens of Pennsylvania.''

 The Committee thereafter published a proposal for new Orphans' Court Rules on April 13, 2013 in the Pennsylvania Bulletin, 43 Pa.B. 2010, with a comment period that expired on June 13, 2013. The Committee received numerous comments which were thoroughly reviewed and vetted. Where necessary or deemed appropriate the Committee revised the published proposal based upon the comments received. The Committee then submitted a revised draft of these proposed new Orphans' Court Rules to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court (the ''Court'') with a recommendation for their adoption. The Court adopted the following rules by Order dated December 1, 2015, with an effective date of September 1, 2016.

Introduction

 It is the Committee's intent and belief that the recently adopted Supreme Court Orphans' Court Rules (the ''O.C. Rules'' or ''Rules'') will standardize procedures throughout the Commonwealth for presenting and having disputes adjudicated in the orphans' court divisions of the courts of common pleas and will promote uniformity in the content of pleadings. These new statewide O.C. Rules are intended to accomplish the following three objectives:

 (1) promote a standard statewide practice and reduce variations caused by reliance on local practice;

 (2) provide clear procedures to practitioners and judges throughout the state, especially those in counties without dedicated orphans' court divisions; and

 (3) harmonize orphans' court proceedings with general civil practice to the extent possible.

 The Committee is aware that, with respect to the adjudication and confirmation of accounts, Title 20 (the Probate, Estates and Fiduciaries Code) distinguishes between counties having a separate orphans' court division and those counties having no separate orphans' court division. 20 Pa.C.S. §§ 3511, 3512. The Committee analyzed these statutory provisions to determine whether this distinction required or warranted differing procedures for the filing of Accounts, the need to have accompanying petitions for adjudication/statements of proposed distribution filed with Accounts, and the procedures for providing notice to interested parties. In the end, the Committee recommended that a trust or estate beneficiary in a smaller county is entitled to the same notice, information and protection as a trust or estate beneficiary in a larger county with a separate orphans' court division. Consequently, these new O.C. Rules do not differentiate between judicial districts with and without a separate orphans' court division; but rather, these new Rules ensure that best procedural practices are mandated and followed throughout the Commonwealth. To the extent that uniform statewide procedures embodied in these O.C. Rules might be viewed as conflicting with the statutory provisions of 20 Pa.C.S. §§ 3511 and 3512, the Rules include a cross-reference to Pa.R.C.P. No. 133, which suspends all statutes addressing procedural aspects to the extent that such statutes are inconsistent with procedural rules.

 The Committee also carefully considered which rules of civil procedure to cross-reference in these Rules, which rules of civil procedural to adopt and restate within the text of the Rules, and which rules of civil procedure not to incorporate because of irrelevancy or undue burdens. For example, the rules of civil procedure regarding discovery have not been incorporated herein, but rather the conduct of discovery is left to the local orphans' court, with a proviso defaulting to the rules of civil procedure only if not otherwise provided for by a local rule. In addition, where appropriate, the pertinent rules of civil procedure have been narrowly tailored, such as in Orphans' Court Rule 2.8, limiting the grounds upon which preliminary objections may be raised against the objections filed to an Account.

 The new O.C. Rules reflect an attempt to strike a balance between increasing the number and breadth of procedural rules so that all parties throughout the Commonwealth are operating with known procedures while not unduly burdening these same participants with additional requirements. Having a standardized, detailed roadmap to orphans' court proceedings hopefully will enable practitioners to operate more efficiently, which in turn will improve the presentation of matters before the bench. In counties without separate, dedicated orphans' court divisions, these O.C. Rules will address many areas that were not covered in the skeletal collection of prior rules. Having the same established method operate in all sixty judicial districts will assist the appellate courts when a matter is appealed. The appellate courts will be able to more readily determine if there were any procedural defects in the proceeding below, and if so, whether these defects affected substantive rights. In the end, these developments will benefit litigants and the public at large.

Organization

 The new rules are divided into sections addressing, inter alia, introductory matters and definitions, the filing and audit of Accounts, the procedures for initiating litigation by citation and petition, pre-hearing and post-hearing procedures, and rules for practice before the Registers of Wills. In brief summary,

 • Chapter I contains introductory rules which consolidate and expand upon prior O.C. Rule 1 and prior O.C. Rule 2.

 • Chapter II contains rules and procedures specific to the filing and auditing of Accounts and the resolution of issues and disputes through the audit or confirmation process. This Chapter encompasses and adds to the procedure previously found in prior O.C. Rule 6, prior O.C. Rule 9, and prior O.C. Rule 13.

 • Chapter III sets forth rules and procedures concerning the resolution of issues and disputes through citations and notice petitions, which modifies and expands upon some of the procedures contained previously in prior O.C. Rule 3 and prior O.C. Rule 5.

 • Chapter IV addresses general formatting rules, service upon individuals and entities who are acting in a representative capacity, service upon the Office of the Attorney General, the docketing and service of court orders, and the implementation of electronic filing. This Chapter relocates and amplifies upon procedures previously found in prior O.C. Rule 3 and prior O.C. Rule 5.

 • Chapter V sets forth rules addressing specific petitions and for the most part contains rules that merely have been relocated from prior O.C. Rule 12, without substantial revisions.

 • Chapter VI is being reserved for future use.

 • Chapter VII provides rules relating to pre-hearing and hearing procedures, which includes prior O.C. Rule 3.6 and several new rules borrowed from civil practice.

 • Chapter VIII provides new post-hearing procedures which dispense with former O.C. Rules 7.1 and 7.2.

 • Chapter IX contains the rules previously found as part of prior O.C. Rule 8 regarding auditors and masters.

 • Chapter X sets forth rules relating to practice before the Register of Wills, relocates and amends prior O.C. Rule 5.6 and prior O.C. Rule 6.12, and provides additional new rules.

 The next three sequential Chapters (i.e., Chapters XI, XII, and XIII) have been reserved for future use, thereby allowing the guardianship rules, adoption rules and Abortion Control Act rules to remain with their present rule number prefixes of 14, 15, and 16, respectively.

 In these O.C. Rules, there are instances where the new rule is substantially identical to its former counterpart and merely has been relocated to a new Chapter based upon the revised structure of these new Rules. (For example, Rules governing Specific Types of Petitions are moved from prior O.C. Rule 12 to Chapter V.) For this reason, following each O.C. Rule is a note indicating whether the rule derives from a prior O.C. Rule, either in total or with modifications, or whether the rule derives from a rule of civil procedure. The Committee has included these notes because it is believed that knowing the origins of a rule will help practitioners and jurists understand the purposes and effect of the rule, thereby aiding in a more proper implementation of the rule. Also, this information is intended to assist local courts and county bar committees in reviewing their local rules to determine the future placement of a current local rule that they wish to retain.

Local Rules

 Many local rules promulgated before December 1, 2015 under previously existing O.C. Rules 1 to 13 and 17 will now be obsolete. Consequently, Orphans' Court Rule 1.5, governing the adoption and dissemination of local rules, provides that all existing local rules, except for local rules on guardianships, adoptions, and the Abortion Control Act, will be vacated as of September 1, 2016.

 In addition, Orphans' Court Rule 1.5 requires courts to submit any proposed new local rule to the Committee for review and vetting prior to the local rule's promulgation and effective date. The Committee will review and analyze each proposed new local rule only insofar as to determine whether the proposed local rule is inconsistent with a Supreme Court Orphans' Court Rule. Rule 1.5 is modeled after its counterpart rule of criminal procedure. See Pa.R.Crim.P. 105.

 Because under subparagraph (e) of new Rule 1.5, it is a prerequisite for the Committee to review and accept each proposed new local rule in advance of its promulgation, local courts must send all proposed new local rules to the Committee by June 1, 2016 so that the Committee has sufficient time to vet the proposed new local rules and send appropriate notices to the local courts before the sunset date of September 1, 2016. The Supreme Court has set forth these dates in its Order of December 1, 2015 re: Review and Vacatur of Local Orphans' Court Rules.

 If proposed local rules are submitted to the Committee by June 1, 2016, the Committee will review the proposed local rules to ensure that the proposal is not inconsistent with any current existing Supreme Court O.C. Rule and, absent unforeseen circumstances, the Committee will issue notice to the local court before September 1, 2016 as to whether the local rule may be adopted and promulgated. After June 1, 2016, local courts should continue to submit proposed new local rules to the Committee for review and vetting as required by subparagraph (e) of new Orphans' Court Rule 1.5. However, with respect to proposed local rules submitted for Committee review after June 1, 2016, the Committee does not guarantee that it will be able to respond to the local court prior to September 1, 2016, when all currently existing local rules in Chapters 1 through 13 and 17 are vacated.

 It is the Committee's belief that a review and redrafting of local rules will not prove to be difficult or time consuming for local courts and local county rule committees. First, the scope and breadth of the new Supreme Court O.C. Rules is so extensive and detailed that only a few areas will need to be covered by local rules. One of the purposes of the extensive set of new O.C. Rules is to eliminate the need for and presence of numerous and lengthy local orphans' court rules. Second, each new Supreme Court O.C. Rule has a note indicating the origins of that rule. It is anticipated that local county courts and county rule committees will be able to review the current local rules and determine whether to keep, redraft, or eliminate such local rules. The Committee hopes that the project of promulgating new local orphans' court rules will be one of primarily restructuring and reducing, and not one of redrafting and adding.

 Subparagraph (d) of Rule 1.5 requires each local rule to correspond to its Supreme Court O.C. Rule counterpart. This subparagraph does not forbid use of a letter before or after the number of the local rule. Finally, while the Committee appreciates the place and importance of local rules to effective and efficient judicial administration, the Committee nevertheless expresses reservations about allowing a local court to dismiss a pleading or grant or deny relief based upon non-compliance with a local rule. Notwithstanding, subparagraph (h) of Rule 1.5 provides that a party can be sanctioned for repeated failures to comply with a local rule.

Highlighting specific rules and changes in practice

 In a change from prior practice, Rule 1.8 and Rule 10.1 mandate exclusive use of Supreme Court-promulgated statewide forms. Because a goal of adopting these extensive and thorough statewide O.C. Rules is to implement best practices across the Commonwealth, the Supreme Court-promulgated forms must be used and filed exclusively. Uniformity and standardized practice across the Commonwealth will occur only when all practitioners are required to use, and all Registers and Clerks are required to accept, only Supreme Court-promulgated forms.

 The Supreme Court-promulgated form that accompanies the filing of an Account as provided in Rule 2.4 is titled ''Petition For Adjudication/Statement of Proposed Distribution.'' This title, albeit verbose, accounts for the differences between counties with and without separate orphans' court divisions: in counties with separate orphans' court divisions, a petition for adjudication is presented when the Account is called for audit, whereas, in counties without separate orphans' court divisions, the Account is filed along with a statement of proposed distribution requesting confirmation and approval of the proposed distribution. By including both nomenclatures in the title of this form, the Committee means to indicate to practitioners and the bench that the form should be used and should accompany an Account filed in all counties regardless of whether the judicial district has a separate orphans' court division.

 Chapter II provides a complete and comprehensive set of rules governing Accounts and the disposition of disputes through the Account process. This Chapter establishes standardized, statewide procedures for (i) preparing and formatting Accounts; (ii) filing Accounts and the accompanying petitions for adjudication/statements of proposed distribution; (iii) providing notice to interested parties that an Account and a distribution proposal has been filed with the court; (iv) raising and pursuing objections by interested parties to the Account or distribution proposal; and (v) obtaining court approval confirming or adjudicating the Account and authorizing distribution as proposed or as modified.

 Following a practice currently in place in many counties, subparagraph (a) of Rule 2.4 requires the petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution to be filed with the Account. The benefits of filing the petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution simultaneously with the Account are as follows:

 (1) interested parties are able to obtain a copy and review the petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution in advance so that they can then determine whether they have objections to the information and proposals in this pleading;

 (2) the accountant or his or her counsel is compelled at the time of the Account's filing to review the governing instrument and determine if there are interpretation questions or potential disputes about distribution; and

 (3) the court, if it is so inclined, can review the petition or statement in advance of the audit date or the last day for filing objections and notify the accountant or his or her counsel of deficiencies in the pleading or the absence of documents required to be attached.

 Next, Rule 2.5 aims to standardized procedures for who is to be notified of an Account's filing, when and how such notice is to be given, and what must be contained or enclosed with the notice. Starting first with the interested parties to be notified of an Account's filing, the following new subparagraphs are worth noting. Subparagraph (b) of Rule 2.5 requires notice of the Account's filing to be sent to both counsel and the interested individual or entity even when such interested party is represented by counsel. Remembering that estates may take years to administer and trusts may continue for generations, it is commonplace for counsel to have represented an interested party in the filing of a prior Account or the resolution of an earlier dispute. Given that the prior Account was adjudicated or the prior dispute resolved, the attorney-client relationship may have terminated by the time the subject Account is filed. If the individual or entity does not receive notice of the Account's filing, then such individual or entity may remain uninformed and lose rights to review the instant Account and pursue new objections. Second, subparagraph (c) of Rule 2.5 provides that if the proposed distribution is to an estate of which a charity is a beneficiary or to a trust of which a charity is a ''qualified beneficiary'' as such term is defined in 20 Pa.C.S. § 7703, then notice of the Account's filing also must be sent to the Attorney General. Similarly, if the proposed distribution is to an estate or trust and one of the accountants stating the Account is a fiduciary of the receiving estate or trust, then notice of the Account's filing must be provided to the beneficiaries of the recipient estate or trust.

 With respect to when and how notice is to be given, subparagraph (d) of Rule 2.5 requires written notice to be sent 20 days prior to the audit date in counties with separate orphans' court divisions or 20 days prior to the date when objections must be filed in counties without separate orphans' court divisions. If an audit is continued or the date for filing objections is extended, subparagraph (e) requires the mailing of additional notice to all parties who received the initial mailing, not simply those who may have already filed objections.

 Lastly, in regards to the contents of the notice, subparagraph (h) of Rule 2.5 requires the position of the accountant to be stated as to (i) any known dispute; (ii) a question regarding a document's interpretation; and (iii) its understanding of the nature of each contested or unpaid claim. While the Committee is aware that some fiduciaries are reluctant to take a stance, preferring instead to be a ''stakeholder,'' it is imperative for the fiduciary as the accountant to expressly state a position. Without a stated position, the beneficiary and/or creditor receiving notice of the Account's filing cannot know whether to pursue objections because such beneficiary and/or creditor is not made aware of what relief is being requested of the court.

 O.C. Rule 2.7 regarding objections expands upon prior O.C. Rule 6.10. In crafting this more detailed rule, the Committee reviewed the local rules of many counties and selected those provisions embodying best practices and explaining most clearly and comprehensively how objections should be pleaded and verified, and the time by which objections should be filed with the court.

 With the repeal of the equity rules on January 1, 2004, the authority to file and the procedures for resolving preliminary objections to Account objections vanished, resulting in a medley of judicial responses that ranged from refusing to permit preliminary objections to relying upon the rules of civil procedure. O.C. Rule 2.8 rectifies this vacuum and is derived in part from Pa.R.C.P. No. 1028. With that said, Rule 2.8 differs from its civil counterpart by limiting permissible preliminary objections to only two grounds: (i) lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter, and (ii) lack of standing. By limiting preliminary objections to only these two grounds in the Account context, the Committee balanced the need for a procedure by which the court quickly can address and perhaps dismiss objections to an Account with concern from practitioners and the bench not to allow ''scorched earth'' litigation tactics that increase the costs and delay resolution. Specifically, a court's lack of jurisdiction over the estate or trust or a party's lack of standing to pursue objections is paramount to an orderly and expedient adjudication or confirmation of an Account. On the other hand, the exclusion of scandalous or impertinent matter is not essential to the orderly disposition of objections, but rather serves only to delay the proceeding and cause substantial fees to be incurred by the res of the trust or estate or by the objecting party. Lack of jurisdiction over the person would never be a proper objection because the adjudication or confirmation of an Account is an in rem proceeding, not an in personam proceeding. Lack of specificity is not an impediment to resolving objections and thus a preliminary objection on these grounds would not aid the court. In most instances, the objecting beneficiary does not have the means to provide more specificity to its objections; the assets and much of the relevant information concerning these assets is in the possession of the fiduciary who prepared the Account.

 If a dispute is not brought before the orphans' court through the filing of an Account and the raising of objections, the other method by which to proceed in orphans' court is through the filing of a petition. The O.C. Rules contained in Chapter III are intended to have petition practice in orphans' court resemble as closely as possible petition practice in the other civil divisions. In fact, many of the Rules in Chapter III are derived from a particular rule of civil procedure as indicated by the notes appearing after each Rule in this Chapter.

 Chapter V sets forth rules governing specific petitions. In all but one instance, these Rules are derived from rules contained in prior O.C. Rule 12. The one exception is O.C. Rule 5.1 governing declaratory petitions, which is based upon a particular local court rule. In the Committee's opinion, the prevalence of declaratory judgment actions in orphans' court warrants a specific rule governing these petitions.

 Chapter VIII abolishes the long-standing tradition of Exception practice in orphans' court. The benefits and reasons for filing Exceptions are now historical. In a prior time, an en banc panel of orphans' court judges heard the Exceptions and determined whether the underlying order, decision, or adjudication should be vacated or amended. In today's practice, the jurist issuing the underlying opinion or order frequently is the only jurist considering the Exceptions. The practical effect is that Exceptions are considered and resolved today in much the same way that motions for reconsideration are considered and resolved, i.e., by the judge who was the trier of fact.

 For this reason, there is no reason to have different appellate tracks for orphans' court matters and civil matters. Parties, practitioners, and jurists at both the lower court and appellate level benefit if the orphans' court division employs the same procedures as the civil division for purposes of having the trial judge reconsider the underlying decision and for pursuing the appeal from any underlying order or opinion. Thus, in the accompanying new Rules, Rule 8.1 eliminates and abolishes Exceptions practice. Rule 8.2 establishes procedures for filing motions for reconsideration. Because this is a new regime in orphans' court, the last clause of subparagraph (a) of Rule 8.2 attempts to make clear that the filing of a motion for reconsideration does not toll the thirty (30) day period for filing an appeal unless, before the expiration of those thirty (30) days, the lower court issues an order granting reconsideration. Lastly, in keeping with prior Exception practice, subparagraph (c) of Rule 8.2 prohibits motions for reconsideration in involuntary termination proceedings and adoption matters, which is consistent with the provisions of children's fast track appeals found in Pa.R.A.P. 904(f) and 1925(a)(2).

 Lastly, the Committee believes the Rules in Chapter X strike the appropriate balance between keeping practice before the Register accessible to pro se individuals who cannot or do not wish to retain counsel and having uniform, statewide rules to ensure an orderly administration of quasi-judicial proceedings before the Register. These Rules, particularly Rule 10.3, establish uniform, predictable, and acceptable protocols for hearings conducted before the Register. In response to comments and concerns about the published proposal, the Committee did not recommend that all evidentiary hearings be recorded or transcribed or that the party initiating the hearing bear the costs of such recording and transcribing. Instead, subparagraph (a) of Rule 10.3 requires evidentiary hearings before the Register to be recorded or transcribed only when directed by the Register or requested by an interested party and the cost of this service is to be allocated among the parties as the Register directs. On the other hand, despite criticism, subparagraph (c) of this Rule, as did its counterpart in the published proposal, requires all evidentiary hearings before the Register to be conducted in accordance with the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence. Justice is delayed and rendered ever more costly if the Registers are not required to adhere to the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence, because on appeal to the orphans' court, the orphans' court will enforce and abide by the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence. As a result, hearsay, unauthenticated documents, and unsubstantiated allegations admitted in the Register's hearing no longer will be admissible, which could result in the orphans' court reversing the decision of the Register. In the Committee's opinion, it is better for all interested parties if the inadmissible evidence never is introduced and considered at the initial hearing before the Register.

 Before concluding, the Committee wishes to extend both its gratitude and congratulations to all who have served on this Committee since 2007 and those who were specially consulted on this project or reviewed earlier permeations. The Committee is indebted to its present chairperson, John F. Meck, Esq., for steadily guiding this project to completion and to prior chairperson, the Honorable Calvin S. (''Pete'') Drayer, Jr., for his vision in beginning this project. The Committee also thanks its prior chairpersons, Mary Jane Barrett, Esq. and Margaret Gallagher Thompson, Esq., who were instrumental in faithfully maneuvering this project forward.
