ORDER
AND NOW, this ______ day of ____________________, 20___, this case having been praeciped onto the

for this hearing. Whether or not written objections are filed, the Court Administrator will place this case on
the trial list for _________________ and schedule the pre-trial conference for the _______ day of

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED AND DECREED that, if this case is not stricken from the trial list, all
depositions to perpetuate testimony for use at trial shall be completed not later than five days after the pretrial conference date scheduled by the Court Administrator. In their pre-trial statements required by Local

The purpose of this Order is to insure that this case, which has been certified as ready for trial, is in fact in
that posture. It is the intention of this Court that meaningful stipulations and settlement discussions occur at
the pre-trial conference and that the integrity of the trial list be preserved. There shall be no variations from
this procedure.

(b) In counseled matters, the Prothonotary shall send, along with the notice
of docketing as required by Pa.R.A.P. 907(a) or 1514(a)(3), the relevant Docketing Statement form to counsel for the appellant, petitioner or plaintiff.
(1) Counsel for the appellant, petitioner or plaintiff shall file an original
and one copy of the Docketing Statement and all required attachments within
ten days of receipt of the notice of docketing.
(2) An unrepresented party shall not be required to file a Docketing Statement.
(c) The party filing the Docketing Statement shall include as attachments:
(1) A statement of issues that shall be no more than two pages in length,
and shall set forth a brief summary of the issues and the case sufficient for an
understanding of the nature of the appeal, petition for review or complaint.
Information in the statement of issues shall be used to screen cases for the
Mediation Program, shall not bind any party, and any issue omitted shall not
constitute a waiver of the issue before the Court. The statement of issues shall
follow the format required by Pa.R.A.P. 124(a).
(2) In matters addressed to the Court’s appellate jurisdiction, a copy of the
judgment or order on appeal and any opinion or adjudication issued by the
common pleas court or agency.
(3) Proof of Service of the Docketing Statement and all attachments indicating service on all parties in accordance with Pa.R.A.P. 121.

Official Note: The Commonwealth Court Mediation Program is governed by Section 501
of the Internal Operating Procedures of the Commonwealth Court, 210 Pa. Code § 69.501
(Mediation). Counsel must draft the statement of issues so as to provide all the information
required by paragraph (c)(1) and allow for adequate screening for mediation. Counsel should not
simply attach a copy of the Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) statement of errors complained of on appeal filed
in the trial court, because that statement would not provide an adequate ‘‘summary of the issues
and the case sufficient for an understanding of the nature’’ of the matter. The attachments
required by paragraph (c)(2) may include, for example, the trial court order and opinion, the
order and adjudication of a zoning hearing board, the decision of a Workers’ Compensation
Judge, and similar orders.

POST DECISION
Rule 3740. Request to Report Unreported Opinion.
Within 30 days after an opinion has been filed as unreported, any person may
file an application to report the opinion. Except as noted in the next sentence,
grant of the application requires an affirmative majority vote of the Commissioned Judges. Grant of an application to report an opinion of a single Judge or

decisions;
(3) modifies or criticizes an existing rule of law;
(4) resolves an apparent conflict of authority;
(5) involves a legal issue of continuing public interest; or

ENFORCEMENT OF AGENCY ORDER
Rule 3761. Enforcement Proceedings.
(a) Government Unit’s Enforcement of its Own Orders.
(1) Petition. When a government unit seeks to enforce an order issued
under a statute which it administers, it may initiate the proceedings by filing a
petition to enforce.
(2) Service. The petitioner shall serve the petition and order in the manner
prescribed by the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure for service of original
process and shall file the return or certificate of service prescribed by the same
rules.
(3) Hearing and Notice. Upon the filing of a petition to enforce, the Court
will issue an order setting a date for a hearing and a date by which the respondent must answer the petition. The petitioner shall serve the Court’s order upon
the respondent in the manner prescribed by Pa.R.A.P. 121 and 122.
(4) Relief. Following the hearing, the Court will enter such orders as may
be appropriate.
(5) Discovery. Discovery shall be allowed only upon leave of court.
(b) Enforcement of Final Determinations of the Office of Open Records.
(1) Petition. When a party to a proceeding before the Office of Open
Records seeks to enforce a final determination regarding a record requested
from a Commonwealth Agency, Legislative Agency, or Judicial Agency, it may
initiate proceedings in the Commonwealth Court by filing a petition to enforce.
(2) Caption. The petition shall name as the petitioner the party seeking
relief. The government unit alleged not to have complied with the final determination and all others who participated in the proceedings before the Office
of Open Records shall be named as respondents.
(3) Form. The petition shall be divided into consecutively numbered paragraphs. Each paragraph shall contain, as nearly as possible, a single allegation
of fact or other statement.
(4) Content. The petition shall state the basis for the jurisdiction of the
Court, identify the parties, state the date that the final determination was
entered, state the material facts giving rise to the need for judicial review, and
include a short statement of the relief sought.
(5) Final determination. A copy of the final determination sought to be
enforced shall be attached to the petition as an exhibit.
(6) Verification. The petition shall be verified.
(7) Service. The petitioner shall serve the petition in the manner prescribed
by the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure for service of original process
and shall file the return or certificate of service prescribed by those rules.
(8) Hearing and Notice. Upon the filing of a petition to enforce, the Court
will issue an order setting a date for a hearing and a date by which the respon210 Rule 3761 APPELLATE PROCEDURE
37-12
(402920) No. 554 Jan. 21 Copyright  2021 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
dent(s) must answer the petition. The petitioner shall serve the Court’s order upon
the respondent in the manner prescribed by Pa.R.A.P. 121 and 122.
(9) Discovery. Discovery shall be allowed only upon leave of court.
(10) Relief. Following the hearing, the Court will enter such orders as may
be appropriate.
(c) Compliance with Public Access Policy. The petition shall include a certificate of compliance as required by Pa.R.A.P. 127.
Official Note: Pa.R.A.P. 3761 implements Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission v.
School District of Philadelphia, 557 Pa. 126, 132, 732 A.2d 578, 581 (1999), in which the Court
held that ‘‘just as enforcement proceedings are not originally commenced in Commonwealth
Court, they are also in the appellate, rather than the original, jurisdiction of the court. It then
follows that the rules of appellate procedure, rather than the rules of civil procedure, govern
enforcement proceedings in Commonwealth Court.’’ This analysis was confirmed in Department
of Environmental Protection v. Township of Cromwell, 613 Pa. 1, 32 A.3d 639 (2012). Petitions
for enforcement are not within any other provisions of the Rules of Appellate Procedure. Thus
absent Pa.R.A.P., 3761, there would be no clear method of presenting enforcement actions to the
Commonwealth Court.
Pa.R.A.P. 3761(b) provides the method for seeking compliance with a final determination of
the Office of Open Records in the Commonwealth Court. This differs from proceeding in the
courts of common pleas, where the method to obtain judicial review of alleged failure to comply with a final determination of the Office of Open Records may be an action in mandamus or
other petition authorized by local rule. Capinski v. Upper Pottsgrove Township, 164 A.3d 601
(Pa. Cmwlth. 2017). Use of this petition is appropriate when the final determination was not
appealed. If an appeal was taken and the order affirmed by the Commonwealth Court, enforcement is not of the final determination of the Office of Open Records, but rather of the order of
the Commonwealth Court.
Because the petition in Pa.R.A.P. 3761(b) is similar to the petition for enforcement of a government unit’s own orders described in Pa.R.A.P. 3761(a), both are deemed to be addressed to
the appellate jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court, and thus appealable to the Supreme Court
only by filing a petition for allowance of appeal. Township of Cromwell, 32 A.3d at 649; School
District of Philadelphia, 732 A.2d at 581.

(a) Unless otherwise stated, words and phrases used in these rules shall have
the meanings given to them under Article V.
(b) Administrative case docket—A docket created upon the initiation of a formal proceeding by the filing of a petition to rehabilitate or liquidate an insurance
company.
(c) Adversarial proceeding—Any action (1) initiated by the rehabilitator or
liquidator against persons other than the insurer, (2) asserting a right or interest
afforded by Article V and for which neither Article V nor prior orders of the
Court provide an avenue for redress, and (3) that the Court determines shall be
governed by Pa.R.A.P. 3783 (adversarial proceedings) as an adversarial proceeding.
(d) Ancillary case docket—A docket created when an adversarial proceeding
is initiated or when a creditor files an objection to the liquidator’s claim determination under Pa.R.A.P. 3781(c) (claim procedure).
(e) Court—The Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania.
(f) Formal proceeding—An action to rehabilitate or liquidate an insurer pursuant to Sections 515 or 520 of Article V, 40 P.S. §§ 221.15, 221.20.
(g) Master service list—The list maintained by the Commissioner or receiver,
as the case may be, as directed in Pa.R.A.P. 3778 (master service list).
Official Note: Administrative Case Docket—The following illustrates the types of filings
that may appear on an administrative case docket: any response to the petition to rehabilitate or
liquidate; applications to intervene; a receiver’s applications for approval of reports, partial distributions, administrative expenses, etc. and any responses thereto; applications seeking to compel the issuance of a notice of determination on a proof of claim or any other filings by the
receiver related to the administration of the liquidation or rehabilitation. Other than the filing
that initiated an ancillary case docket, the administrative case docket will not usually include
filings related to matters assigned to an ancillary case docket.
Adversarial proceeding—This type of proceeding does not include objections filed by a
claimant to the liquidator’s notice of determination. Objections to a notice of determination on
a claim are specially governed by Rule 3781 (claim procedure).

Rule 3774. Manner of Initiating Article V Proceedings.
(a) Judicial review of summary orders (Section 510 of Article V, 40 P. S.
§ 221.10). A request for judicial review of a summary order issued by the Commissioner shall be presented by petition for review and shall conform to the provisions of Chapter 15 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure applicable to matters in the Court’s original jurisdiction.
(b) Court’s seizure order (Section 512 of Article V, 40 P. S. § 221.12). A petition by the Commissioner for a seizure order shall state the material facts that
constitute the grounds for relief. The petition for seizure may be decided with or
without an answer or a hearing. An insurer may petition the Court for hearing and
review of an ex parte seizure order at any time and shall set forth the factual and
legal basis in support of a contention that the Court should vacate or modify the
seizure order. The Court may set a time for the Commissioner to file an answer,
but in any event the Court shall decide the petition for hearing and review in
accordance with Sections 512(d) and 513(a), (b), 40 P. S. §§ 221.12(d) and
221.13(a), (b).
(c) Formal proceedings to commence rehabilitation or liquidation (Sections
515 and 520 of Article V, 40 P. S. §§ 221.15 and 221.20).
(1) A petition by the Commissioner for rehabilitation or liquidation shall
state the material facts that constitute the grounds for relief.
(2) Unless the Court otherwise orders, within thirty (30) days of the filing
of a petition for rehabilitation or a petition for liquidation, the insurer shall file
either an answer to the petition or consent to the entry of an order granting the
relief the Commissioner seeks in the petition. An answer shall state the material facts that constitute a defense to the petition. No other response by the
insurer is permitted.
(3) Following the entry of an order to rehabilitate or liquidate the business
of an insurer, the Court may enter a case management order to supplement
these Rules.
Official Note: Special forms of petition—A petition by the Commissioner for a seizure
order or a petition by the Commissioner for an order of rehabilitation or liquidation is not a
petition for review governed by Chapter 15 of the Appellate Rules because neither of these petitions present a challenge to government action. The term ‘‘petition’’ is used because it is used
in Article V.
For determining a petition for a seizure order, Section 512 establishes a process
that does not conform to the provisions of Chapter 15. Such a petition should be
decided in accordance with the statutory process in conjunction with an order.
210 Rule 3774 APPELLATE PROCEDURE
37-14
(400526) No. 545 Apr. 20 Copyright  2020 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
Rules 3771—3784 establish procedures for addressing petitions for rehabilitation or liquidation and matters associated with rehabilitation or liquidation of an
insurer.
A petition by an insurer for hearing and review of a seizure order presents a
matter properly addressed to the Court’s original jurisdiction. See 42 Pa.C.S.
§ 761 (establishing the Court’s original jurisdiction over all matters arising under
Article V of the Insurance Department Act). However, the provisions of Chapter
15 applicable to original jurisdiction matters have little or no practical applicability to a petition for a hearing and review of an ex parte seizure order for which
Section 512 confers upon the petitioner a right to a hearing within ten days. Consequently, a petition for hearing and review of a seizure order should be decided
in accordance with the statutory process in Section 512 or Court order.
The special forms of petition named in Rule 3774 (initiating Article V proceedings) are not subject to the Rules of Civil Procedure.

Rule 3775. Intervention in Formal Proceedings.
(a) Intervention. A person not named as a respondent in a formal proceeding
who has a direct and substantial interest in the administration of the insurer’s
business or estate may request leave of court to intervene.
(b) Application to intervene. A request for leave to intervene, generally or for
a limited purpose, shall be by application and answer, if any, in accordance with
Pa.R.A.P. 123 (application for relief). The application shall contain a concise
statement of the interest of the applicant and the purposes for which the applicant
seeks to intervene. A copy of the document to be filed if the Court allows intervention shall be attached to the application.
(c) Action on application. Intervention in a formal proceeding shall be
allowed if the proven or admitted allegations of the application establish a sufficient interest in the proceedings, unless the interest of the applicant is already
adequately represented or intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the parties.
(1) General intervention. When the applicant demonstrates an ongoing
interest in the administration of the insurer’s business or estate, the Court may
grant the applicant general intervention. The general intervenor shall remain on
the master service list until the formal proceeding is completed.
(2) Limited intervention. When the applicant’s interest involves a discrete
controversy relating to the administration of the insurer’s business or estate, the
Court may grant the applicant limited intervention to participate as a party in
the discrete controversy. The limited intervenor shall not be placed upon the
master service list unless the Court orders otherwise.
(d) Upon grant of an application to intervene, the document attached to the
application to intervene, that is, the application for relief under Pa.R.A.P. 3776 or
COMMONWEALTH COURT BUSINESS 210 Rule 3775
37-15
(400527) No. 545 Apr. 20
complaint under Pa.R.A.P. 3783, shall be deemed filed, and the Court shall direct
the time for filing a response.
Official Note: General or limited intervention—Intervention, whether general or limited in
scope, may be granted for purposes such as, but not limited to:
(1) Oppose a petition by the Commissioner for an order of liquidation or
rehabilitation;
(2) Oppose an application by the receiver for an order relating to the
administration of the insurer’s business or of estate;
(3) Object to a report by the receiver;
(4) Seek relief from any order;
(5) Assert any rights or interest afforded to the person by Article V and for
which neither Article V nor prior orders of the Court provide an avenue for
redress; or
(6) Compel the liquidator to issue a notice of determination if the liquidator has failed to do so in conformity with Pa.R.A.P. 3781 (claim procedure).
Relief from stay—Intervention is a prerequisite to filing an application for relief
from the stay of actions against the insurer that is imposed under Section 526, 40
P.S. § 221.26.

Rule 3776. Applications for Relief or Court Approval.
Relief or approval from the Court shall be requested by application. An application for relief or an application by the receiver for the Court’s approval shall
comply with Pa.R.A.P. 123 (application for relief), except that a response, if any,
shall be filed within thirty (30) days of service of an application for relief or an
application for Court approval. Upon application, the Court may alter the time for
response. The application and any response may be supported by a memorandum
of law.
Official Note: Alteration of the time for response—Requests based on an agreement of the
parties are more likely to receive favorable consideration.
Court approval—From time to time, the receiver must obtain the Court’s
approval of an action proposed to be taken in the course of administering the
estate, such as, but not limited to, making an interim distribution of assets.

(a) Administrative case docket. Upon the filing of a petition to rehabilitate or
liquidate an insurance company under Article V, the Prothonotary shall create an

receiver to commence an adversarial proceeding under Pa.R.A.P. 3783 (adversarial proceeding), when the Court sua sponte directs that a dispute initiated by
an application for relief under Pa.R.A.P. 3776 (applications) be treated as an
adversarial proceeding under Pa.R.A.P. 3783 or when an objection is filed to a
notice of determination under Pa.R.A.P. 3781 (claim procedure), the Prothonotary
will note such filing on the administrative case docket, establish an ancillary case
docket and assign a number for each such matter. The party initiating an ancillary case shall file a completed cover sheet that may be obtained from the Prothonotary or at www.pacourts.us/T/Commonwealth/.

will assume the duty to maintain the master service list. The master service list
shall include the name, address, telephone number, facsimile (fax) number and
electronic mail (e-mail) address of counsel for each party and for each pro se
party in the proceeding at the administrative case docket number.
The receiver is not required to include on the master service list any limited
intervenor or the limited intervenor’s counsel.

Changes in contact information, including transfer of responsibilities to another
attorney in the firm and requests to be removed from the master service list may
be accomplished by notifying the Commissioner or receiver, as the case may be,
by e-mail, fax or mail in accordance with the Commissioner’s or receiver’s
instructions.
(b) Request of non-party for inclusion on master service list. Any interested
person may be added to the master service list by sending a written request to the
Commissioner or receiver, as the case may be, including name, address, telephone number, facsimile number and electronic mail address. A person included
on the master service list pursuant to this subsection shall be designated thereon
as a non-party.
(c) Availability of master service list. The Commissioner or receiver, as the
case may be, shall post and maintain the master service list on any website established under Pa.R.A.P. 3779 (website). If no website has been established, the
master service list shall be available by e-mail upon request. A paper copy of the
master service list shall be available for a standard fee.
Official Note: Court Maintains Its Own Service List—The master service list maintained
by the Commissioner or receiver is not the Court’s service list. The two lists are separately
managed. Amendment or deletion of information on one list does not affect the other list. Notice
of any change must be given to both the Commissioner or receiver and the Court.

will enter a final order sustaining or overruling exceptions in whole or in part.

When the draft opinion has been prepared, the opinion-writing Judge shall

other Judges, with a face sheet bearing the date the case was argued or submitted
on briefs, and also with a memorandum in standardized form requesting them to

may desire to make with respect to the draft opinion, and (2) any disagreement
as to the writer’s recommendation concerning reporting, in accordance with

other Judges shall respond to the opinion-writing Judge within fifteen days. If no
response is received in that time, the opinion-writing Judge shall consider nonresponse as indicating that each Judge not responding is willing to have the opinion filed as circulated.

§ 69.253. Decisions; Concurrences and Dissents.
If a Judge on the Court en banc or the panel before which a case was argued,
or to which it was submitted, responds by stating an intention to write a concurring opinion or a dissenting opinion, the opinion-writing Judge shall hold the
opinion for an additional twenty days, during which period the concurring or dissenting Judge shall submit an opinion to the opinion-writing Judge, to be filed on
the same date as the opinion of the Court. A dissenting or concurring Judge shall
also inform all other Judges of such intention and shall circulate the opinion to
them when written. The opinion-writing Judge shall consider concurrences and
dissents and the reasons for them, and may revise the draft opinion and recirculate it. If a concurring opinion or dissenting opinion is not received by the
opinion-writing Judge within the twenty-day period, the opinion writing Judge
shall consider the previous intent to be waived and may proceed to file the opinion of the Court and any concurring opinions or dissenting opinions actually submitted to the opinion-writing Judge. A Judge on the Court en banc or panel may
join in a concurring or dissenting opinion and shall so notify the opinion-writing
Judge, who shall be responsible for noting the joinder of that Judge in such concurring opinion or dissenting opinion. When a Judge circulates a concurring or
dissenting opinion, the opinion of the Court and any concurring or dissenting
opinion may be filed no earlier than ten days after the circulation of the concurring or dissenting opinion.

opinions, the opinion-writing Judge shall not file the opinion but shall notify the
President Judge to list the case for consideration at the next judicial conference.
If, pursuant to vote after judicial conference consideration, a majority of all of the
Judges, as well as a majority of the Judges who heard the case or to whom it was
submitted on briefs, favor the result reached in the circulated draft opinion, that
opinion, together with any concurring or dissenting opinions and notations of

President Judge shall list the case for consideration before the Court en banc.
(b) When there exists a vacancy or a recusal among the Commissioned
Judges that results in an even number of Commissioned Judges voting on a circulating panel opinion or en banc opinion, and when the vote of all participating
Commissioned Judges results in a tie, the opinion shall be filed as circulated. The
opinion shall contain a footnote on the first page indicating that the opinion is
filed pursuant to this paragraph. Unless there is a majority vote of the participating Commissioned Judges to report, the opinion shall not be reported.

§ 69.501. Mediation.
(a) Scope; Costs; Mediation Judge; Form of Papers.
(1) To facilitate settlement and otherwise assist in the expeditious resolution of matters before the Commonwealth Court, appeals of orders of the courts
of common pleas, petitions for review of state administrative agency decisions
filed in the Court’s appellate jurisdiction, and matters filed in the Court’s original jurisdiction may be selected for mediation by the Court’s Mediation Program.
(2) Tax appeals from orders of the Board of Finance and Revenue, which
are subject to a status conference program, shall be excluded from the Mediation Program.
(3) Mediation shall be offered at no cost to the parties.
(4) Mediation shall be conducted by a Mediation Judge. The Mediation
Judge may dispose of motions related to the scheduling of mediation and the
mediation process. The Mediation Judge shall have authority to impose any
necessary sanctions for the failure of any attorney or party to comply with the
requirements of the Mediation Program.
(5) The mediation statement required by this section, and any other documents prepared for submission to the Mediation Judge, shall follow the format
required by Pa.R.A.P. 124(a).
(b) Selection of Cases and Scheduling; Mediation Statement.
(1) Counseled matters shall be screened for referral to mediation immediately upon the filing of the Docketing Statement and all attachments as required
by Pa.R.A.P. 3706. Any matter not initially screened or selected for mediation
may be referred to the Mediation Program at any time upon request of any
party or at the direction of any Judge, en banc or three-judge panel of the
Court.
(2) After a matter has been selected for mediation, the Prothonotary shall
notify the parties of the referral to the Mediation Program and the name of the
INTERNAL OPERATING PROCEDURES 210 § 69.416
69-17
(413909) No. 583 Jun. 23
Mediation Judge assigned to conduct mediation. The Mediation Judge, when
appropriate, shall promptly contact the parties to establish the location, date
and time for mediation.
(3) Within ten days of receiving notice of mediation, or as otherwise
directed, each party shall submit to the Mediation Judge a confidential mediation statement of no more than five pages, setting forth the positions of the
party as to the key disputed and undisputed facts and legal issues in the matter,
and stating whether prior settlement negotiations have occurred. The mediation
statement shall focus on practical considerations in the matter and the party’s
good faith position on resolving issues by compromise and agreement. The
mediation statement shall also identify any motions filed in Commonwealth
Court and their disposition. The mediation statement shall not be filed with the
Prothonotary or served upon opposing parties, and shall remain confidential.
(4) All matters referred to mediation shall remain subject to the Court’s
normal scheduling for briefing and oral argument. The Prothonotary shall not
modify the Court’s briefing or oral argument schedule unless so directed by the
Mediation Judge to accommodate mediation.
(c) Sessions; Confidentiality; Settlement; Effect of Mediation.
(1) All mediation sessions must be attended by each unrepresented party
and counsel for each represented party with authority to settle the matter and,
if required, such other persons with actual authority to negotiate a settlement,
whether involving the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, a local government
unit, or an individual litigant. The Mediation Judge may at his or her discretion
require the parties (or real parties in interest) to attend mediation. In cases
involving the Commonwealth government, upon direction of the Mediation
Judge, counsel shall have available someone from the appropriate agency with
authority to settle who can be reached during mediation to discuss settlement if
such person is not already required to attend the mediation session. In the
alternative, the Mediation Judge may obtain the name and title of the government official or officials authorized to settle on behalf of the state or local government unit.
(2) No future mediation shall be conducted unless the Mediation Judge
determines that further sessions are necessary to effectuate a settlement. The
Mediation Judge assigned to mediate a matter shall attend all future mediation
sessions scheduled in the case.
(3) All participants in the Mediation Program shall act with due diligence
and in good faith.
(4) The Mediation Judge shall not disclose the substance of the mediation
settlement discussions and proceedings, and counsel likewise shall not disclose
such discussions and proceedings to anyone other than their clients or
co-counsel. No information obtained during settlement discussions shall be
construed as an admission against interest, and the parties shall not use any
information obtained during settlement discussions as the basis for any motion
or application other than one related to the Court’s briefing or argument sched210 § 69.501 MISCELLANEOUS OPERATING PROCEDURES
69-18
(413910) No. 583 Jun. 23 Copyright  2023 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
uling. All mediation information, documents and communications are to be
kept strictly confidential, not to be used or disclosed outside of mediation. All
statements made in the course of mediation are for mediation purposes only
and are not to be construed as representing the official position of the Mediation Judge, the Court, or any employee thereof.
(5) Where settlement is reached, the parties shall prepare a written settlement agreement and obtain all necessary signatures of the parties and counsel.
The agreement shall be binding upon the parties to the agreement, and after
execution or any necessary approval by a tribunal, the parties shall file a stipulation of dismissal within ten days thereof. Where necessary or upon the
request of a party, the Mediation Judge may enter an appropriate order approving the settlement or remanding the matter to the tribunal below for its
approval, enforcement, or implementation.
(6) Any matter not resolved by mediation shall remain on the Court’s
docket and proceed as if mediation had not occurred.
(7) A Mediation Judge who reviewed a mediation statement or conducted
a mediation session shall not participate in any decision on the merits of the
matter. Upon the termination of mediation, either through settlement and dismissal or through a continuation of the matter and final disposition on the
Court’s docket, the Mediation Judge shall dispose of all documents obtained
during mediation.
Official Note: The Commonwealth Court Mediation Program was established and initially
governed by Order dated September 15, 1999, effective January 1, 2000. That Order has been
withdrawn and supplanted by this section.

Comment:
Preface to Comments
The original Comments to the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence were prepared by the Ad Hoc
Committee on Evidence. The Comments accompanied the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence that were
adopted by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court on May 8, 1998. The Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence
closely followed the format, language, and style of the Federal Rules of Evidence, but the guiding
principle was to preserve the Pennsylvania law of evidence. The original Comments reflected this
approach by identifying the Pennsylvania sources of the law. The original Comments also compared
the Pennsylvania Rules to the Federal Rules for the convenience of the Bench and Bar.
1-1
(417057) No. 591 Feb. 24
The Federal Rules of Evidence were amended effective December 1, 2011. The goal of the Federal
amendments was to make the rules more easily understood and to make the format and terminology
more consistent, but to leave the substantive content unchanged. The Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence
were rescinded and replaced on January 17, 2013, and become effective on March 18, 2013. They
closely follow the format, language, and style of the amended Federal Rules of Evidence. The goal
of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s rescission and replacement of the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence was likewise to make its rules more easily understood and to make the format and terminology
more consistent, but to leave the substantive content unchanged. Once again, the guiding principle is
to preserve the Pennsylvania law of evidence.
These Comments are prepared by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s Committee on Rules of Evidence for the convenience of the Bench and Bar. The Comments have not been adopted by the
Supreme Court and it is not intended that they have precedential significance.
Comment to Rule 101
A principal goal of these rules is to construct a comprehensive code of evidence governing court
proceedings in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. However, these rules cannot be all-inclusive.
Some of our law of evidence is governed by the Constitutions of the United States and of Pennsylvania. Some is governed by statute. Some evidentiary rules are contained in the Rules of Civil and
Criminal Procedure and the rules governing proceedings before courts of limited jurisdiction. Traditionally, our courts have not applied the law of evidence in its full rigor in proceedings such as preliminary hearings, bail hearings, grand jury proceedings, sentencing hearings, parole and probation
hearings, extradition or rendition hearings, and others. Traditional rules of evidence have also been
relaxed to some extent in custody matters, see, e.g., Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.11(b) (court interrogation of
a child), and other domestic relations matters, see, e.g., Pa.R.C.P. No. 1930.3 (testimony by electronic
means).
Decisional law is applicable to some evidentiary issues not covered by these rules. This would
include for example, the corpus delicti rule, see Commonwealth v. Fears, 575 Pa. 281, 836 A.2d 52
(2003); the collateral source rule, see Boudwin v. Yellow Cab Co., 410 Pa. 31, 188 A.2d 259 (1963);
and the parol evidence rule, see Yocca v. Pittsburgh Steelers Sports, Inc., 578 Pa. 479, 854 A.2d 425
(2004). The Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence are not intended to supersede these other provisions of
law unless they do so expressly or by necessary implication.
These rules are applicable in the courts of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania’s unified judicial
system. In some respects, these rules are applicable in administrative proceedings. See, e.g., Gibson
v. W.C.A.B., 580 Pa. 470, 861 A.2d 938 (2004) (evidentiary rules 602, 701 and 702 applicable in
agency proceedings in general, including Workers’ Compensation proceedings). These rules are also
applicable in compulsory arbitration hearings, with specific exceptions relating to the admissibility of
certain written evidence and official documents. See Pa.R.C.P. No. 1305.
Official Note: Adopted May 8, 1998, effective October 1, 1998; Comment revised December 30, 2005, effective February 1, 2006; rescinded and replaced January 17, 2013, effective

These rules should be applied so as to administer every proceeding fairly,
eliminate unjustifiable expense and delay, and promote the development of evidence law, to the end of ascertaining the truth and securing a just determination.
Comment:
This rule is similar to F.R.E. 102.

Rule 103. Rulings on Evidence.
(a) Preserving a Claim of Error. A party may claim error in a ruling to admit
or exclude evidence only:
(1) if the ruling admits evidence, a party, on the record:
(A) makes a timely objection, motion to strike, or motion in limine;
and
(B) states the specific ground, unless it was apparent from the context;
or
(2) if the ruling excludes evidence, a party informs the court of its substance by an offer of proof, unless the substance was apparent from the context.
(b) Not Needing to Renew an Objection or Offer of Proof. Once the court
rules definitively on the record—either before or at trial—a party need not renew
an objection or offer of proof to preserve a claim of error for appeal.
(c) Court’s Statement About the Ruling; Directing an Offer of Proof. The
court may make any statement about the character or form of the evidence, the
objection made, and the ruling. The court may direct that an offer of proof be
made in question-and-answer form.
(d) Preventing the Jury from Hearing Inadmissible Evidence. To the extent
practicable, the court must conduct a jury trial so that inadmissible evidence is
not suggested to the jury by any means.
Comment:
Pa.R.E. 103(a) differs from F.R.E. 103(a). The Federal Rule says, ‘‘A party may claim error in a
ruling to admit or exclude evidence only if the error affects a substantial right of the party. . . .’’ In
Pennsylvania criminal cases, the accused is entitled to relief for an erroneous ruling unless the court
finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the error is harmless. See Commonwealth v. Story, 383 A.2d 155
(Pa. 1978). Civil cases are governed by Pa.R.Civ.P. 126(a) which permits the court to disregard an
erroneous ruling ‘‘which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties.’’ Pa.R.E. 103(a) is consistent with Pennsylvania law.
GENERAL PROVISIONS 225 Rule 102
1-3
(417059) No. 591 Feb. 24
Pa.R.E. 103(a)(1) specifically refers to motions in limine. These motions are not mentioned in the
Federal rule. Motions in limine permit the trial court to make rulings on evidence prior to trial or at
trial but before the evidence is offered. Such motions can expedite the trial and assist in producing
just determinations.
Pa.R.E. 103(b), (c) and (d) are identical to F.R.E. 103(b), (c) and (d).
F.R.E. 103(e) permits a court to ‘‘take notice of a plain error affecting a substantial right, even if
the claim of error was not properly preserved.’’ This paragraph has not been adopted because it is
inconsistent with Pa.R.E. 103(a) and Pennsylvania law. See Commonwealth v. Clair, 458 Pa. 418, 326
A.2d 272 (1974); Dilliplaine v. Lehigh Valley Trust Co., 457 Pa. 255, 322 A.2d 114 (1974).

Rule 104. Preliminary Questions.
(a) In General. The court must decide any preliminary question about
whether a witness is qualified, a privilege exists, or evidence is admissible. In so
deciding, the court is not bound by evidence rules, except those on privilege.
(b) Relevance That Depends on a Fact. When the relevance of evidence
depends on whether a fact exists, proof must be introduced sufficient to support
a finding that the fact does exist. The court may admit the proposed evidence on
the condition that the proof be introduced later.
(c) Conducting a Hearing So That the Jury Cannot Hear it. The court must
conduct any hearing on a preliminary question so that the jury cannot hear it if:
(1) the hearing involves evidence alleged to have been obtained in violation of the defendant’s rights;
(2) a defendant in a criminal case is a witness and so requests; or
(3) justice so requires.
(d) Cross-Examining a Defendant in a Criminal Case. By testifying on a preliminary question, a defendant in a criminal case does not become subject to
cross-examination on other issues in the case.
(e) Weight and Credibility. Even though the court rules that evidence is
admissible, this does not preclude a party from offering other evidence relevant
to the weight or credibility of that evidence.
Comment
Pa.R.E. 104(a) is identical to F.R.E. 104(a).
The second sentence of Pa.R.E. 104(a) is based on the premise that, by and large, the law of evidence is a ‘‘child of the jury system’’ and that the rules of evidence need not be applied when the
judge is the fact finder. The theory is that the judge should be empowered to hear any relevant evi225 Rule 104 RULES OF EVIDENCE
1-4
(417060) No. 591 Feb. 24 Copyright  2024 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
dence to resolve questions of admissibility. This approach is consistent with Pennsylvania law. See
Commonwealth v. Raab, 594 Pa. 18, 934 A.2d 695 (2007).
Pa.R.E. 104(a) does not resolve whether the allegedly inadmissible evidence alone is sufficient to
establish its own admissibility. Some other rules specifically address this issue. For example, Pa.R.E.
902 provides that some evidence is self-authenticating. But under Pa.R.E. 803(25), the allegedly inadmissible evidence alone is not sufficient to establish some of the preliminary facts necessary for
admissibility. In other cases the question must be resolved by the trial court on a case-by-case basis.
Pa.R.E. 104(b) is identical to F.R.E. 104(b).
Pa.R.E. 104(c)(1) differs from F.R.E. 104(c)(1) in that the Federal Rule says ‘‘the hearing involves
the admissibility of a confession;’’ Pa.R.E. 104(c)(1) is consistent with Pa.R.Crim.P. 581(F), which
requires hearings outside the presence of the jury in all cases in which it is alleged that the evidence
was obtained in violation of the defendant’s rights.
Pa.R.E. 104(c)(2) and (3) are identical to F.R.E. 104(c)(2) and (3). Paragraph (c)(3) is consistent
with Commonwealth v. Washington, 554 Pa. 559, 722 A.2d 643 (1998), a case involving child witnesses, in which the Supreme Court created a per se rule requiring competency hearings to be conducted outside the presence of the jury. In Commonwealth v. Delbridge, 578 Pa. 641, 855 A.2d 27
(2003), the Supreme Court held that a competency hearing is the appropriate way to explore an allegation that the memory of a child has been so corrupted or ‘‘tainted’’ by unduly suggestive or coercive interview techniques as to render the child incompetent to testify.
Pa.R.E. 104(d) is identical to F.R.E. 104(d). In general, when a party offers himself or herself as
a witness, the party may be questioned on all relevant matters in the case. See Agate v. Dunleavy, 398
Pa. 26, 156 A.2d 530 (1959). Under Pa.R.E. 104(d), however, when the accused in a criminal case
testifies with regard to a preliminary question only, he or she may not be cross-examined as to other
matters. This is consistent with Pa.R.E. 104(c)(2) in that it is designed to preserve the defendant’s
right not to testify in the case in chief.
Pa.R.E. 104(e) differs from F.R.E. 104(e) to clarify the meaning of this paragraph.

Rule 105. Limiting Evidence That is Not Admissible Against Other Parties
or for Other Purposes.
If the court admits evidence that is admissible against a party or for a
purpose—but not against another party or for another purpose—the court, on
timely request, must restrict the evidence to its proper scope and instruct the jury
accordingly. The court may also do so on its own initiative.
Comment
The first sentence of Pa.R.E. 105 is identical to F.R.E. 105. The second sentence was added to
conform to Pennsylvania practice. There are other ways to deal with evidence that is admissible
against one party but not another, or for one purpose but not another. For example, the evidence may

be redacted. See Commonwealth v. Johnson, 474 Pa. 410, 378 A.2d 859 (1977). In some cases, severance may be appropriate. See Commonwealth v. Young, 263 Pa. Super. 333, 397 A.2d 1234 (1979).
Where the danger of unfair prejudice outweighs probative value the evidence may be excluded. See
Pa.R.E. 403.

Rule 106. Remainder of or Related Writings or Recorded Statements.
If a party introduces all or part of a writing or recorded statement, an adverse
party may require the introduction, at that time, of any other part—or any other
writing or recorded statement—that in fairness ought to be considered at the same
time.
Comment
This rule is identical to F.R.E. 106. A similar principle is expressed in Pa.R.C.P. No. 4020(a)(4),
which states: ‘‘If only part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party, any other party may
require the offering party to introduce all of it which is relevant to the part introduced, and any party
may introduce any other parts.’’
The purpose of Pa.R.E. 106 is to give the adverse party an opportunity to correct a misleading
impression that may be created by the use of a part of a writing or recorded statement that may be
taken out of context. This rule gives the adverse party the opportunity to correct the misleading
impression at the time that the evidence is introduced. The trial court has discretion to decide whether
other parts, or other writings or recorded statements, ought in fairness to be considered contemporaneously with the proffered part.

ARTICLE II. JUDICIAL NOTICE
Rule
201. Judicial Notice of Adjudicative Facts.
Rule 201. Judicial Notice of Adjudicative Facts.
(a) Scope. This rule governs judicial notice of an adjudicative fact only, not
a legislative fact.
(b) Kinds of Facts that may be Judicially Noticed. The court may judicially
notice a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute because it:
(1) is generally known within the trial court’s territorial jurisdiction; or
(2) can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy
cannot reasonably be questioned.
(c) Taking Notice. The court:
(1) may take judicial notice on its own; or
(2) must take judicial notice if a party requests it and the court is supplied
with the necessary information.
(d) Timing. The court may take judicial notice at any stage of the proceeding.
(e) Opportunity to be Heard. On timely request, a party is entitled to be heard
on the propriety of taking judicial notice and the nature of the fact to be noticed.
If the court takes judicial notice before notifying a party, the party, on request, is
still entitled to be heard.
(f) Instructing the Jury. The court must instruct the jury that it may, but is
not required to, accept as conclusive any fact judicially noticed.
Comment
This rule is identical to F.R.E. 201, except for subdivision (f).
Pa.R.E. 201(a) limits the application of this rule to adjudicative facts. This rule is not applicable to
judicial notice of law. Adjudicative facts are facts about the events, persons, places, or other subjects
relevant to the matter before the court. See 1 West’s Pa. Prac., Evidence §§ 201-1, 201-2 (4th ed.
2021).
In determining the law applicable to a matter, the judge is sometimes said to take judicial notice
of law. In Pennsylvania, judicial notice of law has been regulated by decisional law, statute, and rule.
See In re Annual Controller’s Reports for Years 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935 and 1936, 5 A.2d 201 (Pa.
1939) (judicial notice of public laws); 42 Pa.C.S. § 6107 (judicial notice of municipal ordinances);
42 Pa.C.S. § 5327 (judicial notice of laws of any jurisdiction outside the Commonwealth); 45 Pa.C.S.
§ 506 (judicial notice of the contents of the Pennsylvania Code and the Pennsylvania Bulletin); see
also, e.g., Pa.R.A.P. 126 (citation of authority); Pa.R.Civ.P. 242 (same); Pa.R.J.C.P. 138 and 1138
(same), Pa.R.O.C.P. 1.22 (same), Pa.R.Crim.P. 102.1 (same), and Pa.R.Civ.P.M.D.J. 242 (same). This
rule is not intended to change existing provisions of law.
Pa.R.E. 201(f) differs from F.R.E. 201(f). Under the Federal Rule the court is required to instruct
the jury to accept as conclusive any fact judicially noticed in a civil case. In a criminal case, the judicially noticed fact is not treated as conclusive. Under Pennsylvania law, the judicially noticed fact has
not been treated as conclusive in either civil or criminal cases, and the opposing party may submit
evidence to the jury to disprove the noticed fact. See Appeal of Albert, 92 A.2d 663 (Pa. 1952); Commonwealth v. Brown, 631 A.2d 1014 (Pa. Super. 1993).

by the court in the light of reason, experience, scientific principles and the other testimony offered in

Comment
Pa.R.E. 402 differs from F.R.E. 402. The Federal Rule specifically enumerates the various sources
of federal rule-making power. Pa.R.E. 402 substitutes the phrase ‘‘by law’’.
Pa.R.E. 402 states a fundamental concept of the law of evidence. Relevant evidence is admissible;
evidence that is not relevant is not admissible. This concept is modified by the exceptions clause of
the rule, which states another fundamental principle of evidentiary law—relevant evidence may be
excluded by operation of constitutional law, by statute, by these rules, by other rules promulgated by
the Supreme Court or by rules of evidence created by case law.

Rule 403. Excluding Relevant Evidence for Prejudice, Confusion, Waste

The court may exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is outweighed
by a danger of one or more of the following: unfair prejudice, confusing the
issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting
cumulative evidence.
Comment
Pa.R.E. 403 differs from F.R.E. 403. The Federal Rule provides that relevant evidence may be
excluded if its probative value is ‘‘substantially outweighed.’’ Pa.R.E. 403 eliminates the word ‘‘substantially’’ to conform the text of the rule more closely to Pennsylvania law. See Commonwealth v.
Boyle, 498 Pa. 486, 447 A.2d 250 (1982).
‘‘Unfair prejudice’’ means a tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis or to divert the
jury’s attention away from its duty of weighing the evidence impartially.

(A) a defendant may offer evidence of the defendant’s pertinent trait,
and if the evidence is admitted, the prosecutor may offer evidence to rebut
it;

(i) offer evidence to rebut it; and
(ii) offer evidence of the defendant’s same trait; and
(C) in a homicide case, the prosecutor may offer evidence of the
alleged victim’s trait of peacefulness to rebut evidence that the victim was
the first aggressor.
(3) Exceptions for a Witness. Evidence of a witness’s character may be
admitted under Rules 607, 608, and 609.
(4) Exception in a Civil Action for Assault and Battery. In a civil action for
assault and battery, evidence of the plaintiff’s character trait for violence may
be admitted when offered by the defendant to rebut evidence that the defendant
was the first aggressor.
(b) Other Crimes, Wrongs, or Acts.
(1) Prohibited Uses. Evidence of any other crime, wrong, or act is not
admissible to prove a person’s character in order to show that on a particular
occasion the person acted in accordance with the character.
(2) Permitted Uses. This evidence may be admissible for another purpose,
such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident. In a criminal case this evidence is
admissible only if the probative value of the evidence outweighs its potential
for unfair prejudice.
(3) Notice in a Criminal Case. In a criminal case the prosecutor must provide reasonable written notice in advance of trial so that the defendant has a
fair opportunity to meet it, or during trial if the court excuses pretrial notice on
good cause shown, of the specific nature, permitted use, and reasoning for the
use of any such evidence the prosecutor intends to introduce at trial.
Comment
Pa.R.E. 404(a) differs from F.R.E. 404(a). There are two differences. First, F.R.E. 404(a)(2)(B)
gives the defendant the right to introduce evidence of a pertinent trait of character of the alleged victim of the crime subject to the limitations in F.R.E 412. The Pennsylvania Rule differs in that Pennsylvania has not adopted Rule 412. Instead, Pennsylvania recognizes statutory limitations on this
right. In particular, 18 Pa.C.S. § 3104 (the Rape Shield Law) often prohibits the defendant from
introducing evidence of the alleged victim’s past sexual conduct, including reputation evidence. See
Comment to Pa.R.E. 412 (Not Adopted), infra. Second, Pa.R.E 404(a)(4), which applies only to a civil
action for assault and battery, is not part of the federal rule. It is based on Bell v. Philadelphia, 341
Pa. Super. 534, 491 A.2d 1386 (1985).
Pa.R.E 404(a)(1) prohibits the use of evidence of a person’s character or trait of character to prove
conduct in conformity therewith on a particular occasion. The rationale is that the relevance of such
evidence is usually outweighed by its tendency to create unfair prejudice, particularly with a jury. This
does not prohibit the introduction of evidence of a person’s character, or trait of character, to prove
something other than conduct in conformity therewith. For example, a party must sometimes prove a
person’s character or trait of character because it is an element of the party’s claim or defense. See
Pa.R.E. 405(b) and its Comment.
A person’s trait of character is not the same as a person’s habit. The distinction is discussed in the
Comment to Rule 406, infra. If a person’s trait of character leads to habitual behavior, evidence of
the latter is admissible to prove conduct in conformity therewith on a particular occasion, pursuant to
Rule 406.
Pa.R.E. 404(a)(2)(A) which deals with the character of a defendant in a criminal case, is identical
to F.R.E. 404(a)(2)(A). It allows the defendant to ‘‘put his character in issue,’’ usually by calling
character witnesses to testify to his good reputation for a law-abiding disposition, or other pertinent
RELEVANCE AND ITS LIMITS 225 Rule 404
4-3
(408535) No. 569 Apr. 22
trait of character. If the defendant does so, the Commonwealth may (1) cross-examine such witnesses,
subject to the limitations imposed by Rule 405(a), and (2) offer rebuttal evidence.
If a defendant in a criminal case chooses to offer evidence of a pertinent trait of character of an
alleged victim under subsection (a)(2)(B), then subsection (a)(2)(B)(ii) allows the Commonwealth to
offer evidence that the defendant has the same trait of character. For example, in an assault and battery case, if the defendant introduces evidence that the alleged victim was a violent and belligerent
person, the Commonwealth may counter by offering evidence that the defendant was also a violent
and belligerent person. Thus, the jury will receive a balanced picture of the two participants to help
it decide who was the first aggressor.
Pa.R.E. 404(b)(1) is identical to F.R.E. 404(b)(1). It prohibits the use of evidence of other crimes,
wrongs, or acts to prove a person’s character.
Pa.R.E. 404(b)(2), like F.R.E. 404(b)(2), contains a non-exhaustive list of purposes, other than
proving character, for which a person’s other crimes, wrongs, or acts may be admissible. But it differs
in that Pa.R.E. 404(b)(2) requires the probative value of the evidence to outweigh its potential for
prejudice. When weighing the potential for prejudice of evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts, the
trial court may consider whether and how much such potential for prejudice can be reduced by cautionary instructions. See Commonwealth v. LaCava, 666 A.2d 221 (Pa. 1995). When evidence is
admitted for this purpose, the party against whom it is offered is entitled, upon request, to a limiting
instruction. See Commonwealth v. Hutchinson, 811 A.2d 556 (Pa. 2002).
Notice pursuant to subdivision (b)(3) must be provided before trial in such time as to allow the
defendant a fair opportunity to meet the evidence. See Pa.R.E. 609(b)(2) and 902(11). Notice should
be sufficiently in advance of trial so the defendant and court have adequate opportunity to assess the
evidence, the purpose for which it is offered, and whether the requirements of Pa.R.E. 403 have been
satisfied notwithstanding that a final determination as to the admissibility of the evidence must await
trial. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Hicks, 91 A.3d 47, 53-54 (Pa. 2014). The court may excuse the pretrial notice requirement upon a showing of good cause. When notice is provided during trial after a
finding of good cause, the court may need to consider protective measures to assure that the opponent
is not prejudiced.

Rule 405. Methods of Proving Character.
(a) By Reputation. When evidence of a person’s character or character trait is
admissible, it may be proved by testimony about the person’s reputation. Testimony about the witness’s opinion as to the character or character trait of the person is not admissible.
(1) On cross-examination of the character witness, the court may allow an
inquiry into relevant specific instances of the person’s conduct probative of the
character trait in question.

(2) In a criminal case, on cross-examination of a character witness, inquiry
into allegations of other criminal conduct by the defendant, not resulting in
conviction, is not permissible.
(b) By Specific Instances of Conduct. Specific instances of conduct are not
admissible to prove character or a trait of character, except:
(1) In a civil case, when a person’s character or a character trait is an
essential element of a claim or defense, character may be proved by specific
instances of conduct.
(2) In a criminal case, when character or a character trait of an alleged victim is admissible under Pa.R.E. 404(a)(2)(B) the defendant may prove the
character or character trait by specific instances of conduct.
Comment
Pa.R.E. 405(a) differs from F.R.E. 405(a). The first sentence of Pa.R.E 405(a) permits proof of
character or a character trait by reputation testimony, as does F.R.E. 405(a). But the second sentence
specifically prohibits opinion testimony about character or a trait of character. This prohibition is consistent with prior Pennsylvania law. See Commonwealth v. Lopinson, 427 Pa. 284, 234 A.2d 552
(1967), vacated on other grounds, 392 U.S. 647 (1968).
Pa.R.E. 405(a) also differs from F.R.E. 405(a) in that there are two subparagraphs, Pa.R.E.
405(a)(1) and Pa.R.E. 405(a)(2), dealing with cross-examination of a character witness. Pa.R.E.
405(a)(2) prohibits cross-examination of a criminal defendant’s character witnesses regarding criminal conduct of the defendant not resulting in conviction. This is consistent with prior Pennsylvania
law. See Commonwealth v. Morgan, 559 Pa. 248, 739 A.2d 1033 (1999). When a reputation witness
is cross-examined regarding specific instances of conduct, the court should take care that the crossexaminer has a reasonable basis for the questions asked. See Commonwealth v. Adams, 426 Pa. Super.
332, 626 A.2d 1231 (1993).
Pa.R.E. 405(b) differs from F.R.E. 405(b). Unlike F.R.E. 405(b), Pa.R.E. 405(b) distinguishes
between civil and criminal cases in permitting the use of specific instances of conduct to prove character.
With regard to civil cases, Pa.R.E. 405(b)(1) is similar to the Federal Rule in permitting proof of
character by specific instances of conduct where character is an essential element of the claim or
defense. This is consistent with prior Pennsylvania law. See Matusak v. Kulczewski, 295 Pa. 208, 145
A. 94 (1928); Dempsey v. Walso Bureau, Inc., 431 Pa. 562, 246 A.2d 418 (1968). With regard to
criminal cases, under Pa.R.E. 404(a)(2)(B), the accused may offer evidence of a pertinent trait of
character of the alleged crime victim. Under Pa.R.E. 405(b)(2) the trait may be proven by specific
instances of conduct without regard to whether the trait is an essential element of the charge, or
defense. This is consistent with prior Pennsylvania law. See Commonwealth v. Dillon, 528 Pa. 417,
598 A.2d 963 (1991).

Rule 406. Habit; Routine Practice.
Evidence of a person’s habit or an organization’s routine practice may be
admitted to prove that on a particular occasion the person or organization acted
in accordance with the habit or routine practice. The court may admit this evidence regardless of whether it is corroborated or there was an eyewitness.
Comment
This rule is identical to F.R.E. 406. The concepts of ‘‘habit’’ and ‘‘routine practice’’ denote conduct
that occurs with fixed regularity in repeated specific situations. Like the Federal Rule, Pa.R.E. 406
does not set forth the ways in which habit or routine practice may be proven, but leaves this for caseby-case determination. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Rivers, 537 Pa. 394, 644 A.2d 710 (1994) (allowing testimony based on familiarity with another’s conduct); Baldridge v. Matthews, 378 Pa. 566, 570,
106 A.2d 809, 811 (1954) (testimony of uniform practice apparently permitted without examples of
specific instances).
Evidence of habit must be distinguished from evidence of character. Character applies to a generalized propensity to act in a certain way without reference to specific conduct, and frequently contains a normative, or value-laden, component (e.g., a character for truthfulness). Habit connotes one’s
conduct in a precise factual context, and frequently involves mundane matters (e.g., recording the
purpose for checks drawn).

Rule 407. Subsequent Remedial Measures.
When measures are taken by a party that would have made an earlier injury or
harm less likely to occur, evidence of the subsequent measures is not admissible
against that party to prove:
• negligence;
• culpable conduct;
• a defect in a product or its design; or
• a need for a warning or instruction.
But the court may admit this evidence for another purpose such as impeachment or—if disputed—proving ownership, control, or the feasibility of precautionary measures.
Comment
Pa.R.E. 407 differs from F.R.E. 407. The rule has been modified to clarify that the rule only protects the party that took the measures. Though F.R.E. 407 is silent on the point, the courts have generally held that the federal rule does not apply when one other than the alleged tortfeasor takes the
action because the reason for the rule (to encourage remedial measures) is not then implicated. See,
e.g., TLT-Babcock, Inc. v. Emerson Electric Co., 33 F.3d 397, 400 (4th Cir. 1994) (collecting cases).

Rule 408. Compromise Offers and Negotiations.
(a) Prohibited Uses. Evidence of the following is not admissible—on behalf
of any party—either to prove or disprove the validity or amount of a disputed
claim or to impeach by a prior inconsistent statement or a contradiction:
(1) furnishing, promising, or offering—or accepting, promising to accept,
or offering to accept—a valuable consideration in compromising or attempting
to compromise the claim; and
(2) conduct or a statement made during compromise negotiations about the
claim.
(b) Exceptions. The court may admit this evidence for another purpose, such
as proving a witness’s bias or prejudice, negating a contention of undue delay, or
proving an effort to obstruct a criminal investigation or prosecution.
Comment
Pa.R.E. 408(a) differs from F.R.E. 408(a) in that the federal rule in paragraph (a)(2) contains language that seems to permit the use in criminal cases of statements made to government investigators,
regulators, or enforcement authority in negotiations in civil cases. That language has not been adopted
because the use of such statements might conflict with the policies underlying Pa.R.Crim.P. 586
(relating to dismissal of criminal charges not committed by force or violence upon payment of restitution) or Pa.R.Crim.P. 546 (relating to dismissal upon satisfaction or agreement).
This rule does not require the exclusion of any evidence otherwise discoverable merely because it
is presented in the course of compromise negotiations.
Pa.R.E. 408(b) is identical to F.R.E. 408(b).
Admissibility of conduct and statements in mediations pursuant to the Mediation Act of 1996, 42
Pa.C.S. § 5949, is governed by that statute.
Pa.R.E. 408 is consistent with 42 Pa.C.S. § 6141 which provides, in pertinent part, as follows:
§ 6141. Effect of certain settlements
(a) Personal Injuries. Settlement with or any payment made to an injured person or to others
on behalf of such injured person with the permission of such injured person or to anyone entitled to
recover damages on account of injury or death of such person shall not constitute an admission of
liability by the person making the payment or on whose behalf the payment was made, unless the
parties to such settlement or payment agree to the contrary.
(b) Damages to Property. Settlement with or any payment made to a person or on his behalf
to others for damages to or destruction of property shall not constitute an admission of liability by the
person making the payment or on whose behalf the payment was made, unless the parties to such
settlement or payment agree to the contrary.
(c) Admissibility in Evidence. Except in an action in which final settlement and release has
been pleaded as a complete defense, any settlement or payment referred to in subsections (a) and (b)
shall not be admissible in evidence on the trial of any matter.

(2) a nolo contendere plea;

dure, Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, or a comparable rule
or procedure of another state; or
(4) a statement made during plea discussions with an attorney for the prosecuting authority if the discussions did not result in a guilty plea or they
resulted in a later withdrawn guilty plea.
(b) Exceptions. The court may admit a statement described in Rule 410(a)(3)
or (4):
(1) in any proceeding in which another statement made during the same
plea or plea discussions has been introduced, if in fairness the statements ought
to be considered together; or
(2) in a criminal proceeding for perjury, false swearing or unsworn falsification to authorities, if the defendant made the statement under oath, on the
record, and with counsel present.
Comment
Pa.R.E. 410(a)(3) differs from F.R.E. 410(a)(3) in that it refers to the Pennsylvania proceedings to
which the paragraph applies rather than the federal proceedings.
Pa.R.E. 410 does not prohibit the use of a conviction that results from a plea of nolo contendere,
as distinct from the plea itself, to impeach in a later proceeding (subject to Pa.R.E. 609) or to establish an element of a charge in a later administrative proceeding. See Commonwealth v. Snyder, 408
Pa. 253, 182 A.2d 495 (1962) (conviction based on nolo contendere plea could be used to impeach
witness in later criminal proceeding); Eisenberg v. Commonwealth, Dep’t. of Public Welfare, 512 Pa.
181, 516 A.2d 333 (Pa. 1986) (conviction based on nolo contendere plea permitted to establish element of charge in administrative proceeding).
There is also a statute governing the admissibility of guilty pleas and pleas of nolo contendere in
cases charging summary motor vehicle violations when offered in civil cases arising out of the same
facts. See 42 Pa.C.S. § 6142 which provides:
(a) General Rule. A plea of guilty or nolo contendere, or a payment of the fine and costs prescribed after any such plea, in any summary proceeding made by any person charged with a violation
of Title 75 (relating to vehicles) shall not be admissible as evidence in any civil matter arising out of
the same violation or under the same facts or circumstances.
(b) Exception. The provisions of subsection (a) shall not be applicable to administrative or
judicial proceedings involving the suspension of a motor vehicle or tractor operating privilege, learner’s permit, or right to apply for a motor vehicle or tractor operating privilege, or the suspension of
a certificate of appointment as an official inspection station, or the suspension of a motor vehicle,
tractor, or trailer registration.
Pa.R.E. 410(b)(1) is identical to F.R.E. 410(b)(1).
Pa.R.E. 410(b)(2) differs from F.R.E. 410(b)(2) in that ‘‘false statement’’ has been omitted and
replaced with ‘‘false swearing’’ and ‘‘unsworn falsification to authorities’’ to correlate with acts
defined in the Pennsylvania Crime Code. See 18 Pa.C.S. §§ 4903, 4904.

Rule 412. Sex Offense Cases: The Victim’s Sexual Behavior or Predisposition (Not Adopted).
Comment
Pennsylvania has not adopted a Rule of Evidence comparable to F.R.E. 412. In Pennsylvania this
subject is governed by 18 Pa.C.S. § 3104 (the ‘‘Rape Shield Law’’).
18 Pa.C.S. § 3104 provides:
§ 3104. Evidence of victim’s sexual conduct
(a) General rule.—Evidence of specific instances of the alleged victim’s past sexual conduct,
opinion evidence of the alleged victim’s past sexual conduct, and reputation evidence of the alleged
victim’s past sexual conduct shall not be admissible in prosecutions under this chapter except evidence of the alleged victim’s past sexual conduct with the defendant where consent of the alleged
victim is at issue and such evidence is otherwise admissible pursuant to the rules of evidence.
(b) Evidentiary proceedings.—A defendant who proposes to offer evidence of the alleged victim’s past sexual conduct pursuant to subsection (a) shall file a written motion and offer of proof at
the time of trial. If, at the time of trial, the court determines that the motion and offer of proof are
sufficient on their faces, the court shall order an in camera hearing and shall make findings on the
record as to the relevance and admissibility of the proposed evidence pursuant to the standards set
forth in subsection (a).

Rule 413. Evidence of Immigration Status.
(a) Criminal or Delinquency Matters; Evidence Generally Inadmissible. In
any criminal or delinquency matter, evidence of a party’s or a witness’s immigration status shall not be admissible unless immigration status is an essential fact to
prove an element of, or a defense to, the offense, to show motive, or to show bias
or prejudice of a witness pursuant to Rule 607. This paragraph shall not be construed to exclude evidence that would result in the violation of a defendant’s or
a juvenile’s constitutional rights.
(b) Civil Matters; Evidence Generally Inadmissible. In any civil matter, evidence of a party’s or a witness’s immigration status shall not be admissible unless
immigration status is an essential fact to prove an element of, or a defense to, the
action, or to show bias or prejudice of a witness pursuant to Rule 607.
(c) Procedure. Unless a party did not know, and with due diligence could not
have known, that evidence of immigration status would be necessary, the following procedure shall apply prior to any such proposed use of immigration status
evidence:
(1) The proponent shall file under seal and serve a written pretrial motion
containing an offer of proof of the relevancy of the proposed evidence supported by an affidavit.
(2) If the court finds that the offer of proof is sufficient, the court shall
order an in camera hearing.
(3) The court may admit evidence of immigration status pursuant to paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) if it finds the evidence is reliable and relevant, and
that its probative value outweighs the prejudicial nature of evidence of immigration status.
(d) Voluntary Revelation. This rule shall not prohibit a person, or the person’s
attorney, from voluntarily revealing his or her immigration status to the court.
Comment
Pa.R.E. 413 has no counterpart in the Federal Rules. This rule is modeled, in part, after Washington Rule of Evidence 413.
In practice, the introduction of immigration status has received heightened consideration in terms
of relevancy and prejudice. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Sanchez, 595 A.2d 617 (Pa. Super. 1991)
(reference to defendant as an ‘‘illegal alien’’ was irrelevant and prejudicial). This consideration is
warranted to avoid potential intimidation of witnesses for fear of deportation. See, e.g., 8 U.S.C.
§ 1227 (Deportable Aliens). This rule is intended to limit the admissibility of evidence of immigration status for purposes other than those stated in the rule. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Philistin, 53
A.3d 1 (Pa. 2012) (discussing admissibility of immigration status for purpose of proving motive).
Paragraphs (a) and (b) may serve as a basis for limiting discovery about immigration status.
This rule requires the proponent to seek pretrial approval prior to the introduction of evidence of
immigration status. If evidence is admissible, the trial court may consider a cautionary jury instruction to ameliorate its prejudicial effect. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Hairston, 84 A.3d 657 (Pa. 2014).
RELEVANCE AND ITS LIMITS 225 Rule 413

(406171) No. 564 Nov. 21
Nothing in this rule prohibits a court from unsealing a motion.
The procedure set forth in paragraph (c) is unnecessary for immigration status voluntarily revealed
pursuant to paragraph (d). However, all other Rules of Evidence remain applicable. See, e.g., Pa.R.E.
402, 403.

(a) General Rule. Every person is competent to be a witness except as otherwise provided by statute or in these rules.
(b) Disqualification for Specific Defects. A person is incompetent to testify if
the court finds that because of a mental condition or immaturity the person:
(1) is, or was, at any relevant time, incapable of perceiving accurately;
(2) is unable to express himself or herself so as to be understood either
directly or through an interpreter;
(3) has an impaired memory; or
(4) does not sufficiently understand the duty to tell the truth.
Comment
Pa.R.E. 601(a) differs from F.R.E. 601(a). It is consistent, instead, with Pennsylvania statutory law.
42 Pa.C.S. §§ 5911 and 5921 provide that all witnesses are competent except as otherwise provided.
Pennsylvania statutory law provides several instances in which witnesses are incompetent. See, e.g.,
42 Pa.C.S. § 5922 (persons convicted in a Pennsylvania court of perjury incompetent in civil cases);
42 Pa.C.S. § 5924 (spouses incompetent to testify against each other in civil cases with certain
exceptions set out in 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 5925, 5926, and 5927); 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 5930—5933 and 20
Pa.C.S. § 2209 (‘‘Dead Man’s statutes’’).
Pa.R.E. 601(b) has no counterpart in the Federal Rules. It is consistent with Pennsylvania law concerning the factors for determining competency of a person to testify, including persons with a mental
defect and children of tender years. See Commonwealth v. Baker, 466 Pa. 479, 353 A.2d 454 (1976)
(standards for determining competency generally); Commonwealth v. Goldblum, 498 Pa. 455, 447
A.2d 234 (1982) (mental capacity); Rosche v. McCoy, 397 Pa. 615, 156 A.2d 307 (1959) (immaturity).
Pennsylvania case law recognizes two other grounds for incompetency, a child’s ‘‘tainted’’ testimony, and hypnotically refreshed testimony. In Commonwealth v. Delbridge, 578 Pa. 641, 855 A.2d
27 (2003), the Supreme Court reiterated concern for the susceptibility of children to suggestion and
WITNESSES 225 Rule 601
6-1
(365877) No. 461 Apr. 13
fantasy and held that a child witness can be rendered incompetent to testify where unduly suggestive
or coercive interview techniques corrupt or ‘‘taint’’ the child’s memory and ability to testify truthfully
about that memory. See also Commonwealth v. Judd, 897 A.2d 1224 (Pa. Super. 2006).
In Commonwealth v. Nazarovitch, 496 Pa. 97, 436 A.2d 170 (1981), the Supreme Court rejected
hypnotically refreshed testimony, where the witness had no prior independent recollection. Applying
the test of Frye v. United States, 293 F. 1013 (D.C. Cir. 1923) for scientific testimony, the Court was
not convinced that the process of hypnosis as a means of restoring forgotten or repressed memory had
gained sufficient acceptance in its field. Commonwealth v. Nazarovitch, supra; see also Commonwealth v. Romanelli, 522 Pa. 222, 560 A.2d 1384 (1989) (when witness has been hypnotized, he or
she may testify concerning matters recollected prior to hypnosis, but not about matters recalled only
during or after hypnosis); Commonwealth v. Smoyer, 505 Pa. 83, 476 A.2d 1304 (1984) (same).
Pa.R.E 601(b) is not intended to change these results. For the constitutional implications when a
defendant in a criminal case, whose memory has been hypnotically refreshed, seeks to testify, see
Rock v. Arkansas, 483 U.S. 44 (1987).
The application of the standards in Pa.R.E. 601(b) is a factual question to be resolved by the court
as a preliminary question under Rule 104. The party challenging competency bears the burden of
proving grounds of incompetency by clear and convincing evidence. Commonwealth v. Delbridge,
578 Pa. at 664, 855 A.2d at 40. In Commonwealth v. Washington, 554 Pa. 559, 722 A.2d 643 (1998),
a case involving child witnesses, the Supreme Court announced a per se rule requiring trial courts to
conduct competency hearings outside the presence of the jury. Expert testimony has been used when
competency under these standards has been an issue. See e.g., Commonwealth v. Baker, 466 Pa. 479,
353 A.2d 454 (1976); Commonwealth v. Gaerttner, 335 Pa. Super. 203, 484 A.2d 92 (1984).

Rule 602. Need for Personal Knowledge.
A witness may testify to a matter only if evidence is introduced sufficient to
support a finding that the witness has personal knowledge of the matter. Evidence
to prove personal knowledge may consist of the witness’s own testimony. This
rule does not apply to a witness’s expert testimony under Rule 703.
Comment
This rule is identical to F.R.E. 602.
Personal or firsthand knowledge is a universal requirement of the law of evidence. See Johnson v.
Peoples Cab Co., 386 Pa. 513, 514—15, 126 A.2d 720, 721 (1956) (‘‘The primary object of a trial
in our American courts is to bring to the tribunal, which is passing on the dispute involved, those persons who know of their own knowledge the facts to which they testify.’’). Pa.R.E. 602 refers to
225 Rule 602 RULES OF EVIDENCE
6-2
(365878) No. 461 Apr. 13 Copyright  2013 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
Pa.R.E. 703 to make clear that there is no conflict with Rule 703, which permits an expert to base an
opinion on facts not within the expert’s personal knowledge.
It is implicit in Pa.R.E. 602 that the party calling the witness has the burden of proving personal
knowledge. This is consistent with Pennsylvania law. Carney v. Pennsylvania R.R. Co., 428 Pa. 489,
240 A.2d 71 (1968).
Generally speaking, the personal knowledge requirement of Rule 602 is applicable to the declarant
of a hearsay statement. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Pronkoskie, 477 Pa. 132, 383 A.2d 858 (1978)
and Carney v. Pennsylvania R.R. Co., 428 Pa. 489, 240 A.2d 71 (1968). However, personal knowledge is not required for an opposing party’s statement under Pa.R.E. 803(25). See Salvitti v. Throppe,
343 Pa. 642, 23 A.2d 445 (1942); Carswell v. SEPTA, 259 Pa. Super. 167, 393 A.2d 770 (1978). In
addition, Pa.R.E. 804(b)(4) explicitly dispenses with the need for personal knowledge for statements
of personal or family history, and Pa.R.E. 803(19), (20) and (21) impliedly do away with the personal
knowledge requirement by permitting testimony as to reputation to prove personal or family history,
boundaries or general history, and a person’s character.

Comment
In 2006, legislation was enacted pertaining to the certification, appointment, and use of interpreters
in judicial and administrative proceedings for persons having limited proficiency with the English
language and persons who are deaf. See 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 4401—4438; 2 Pa.C.S. §§ 561—588. Pursuant to this legislation, the Administrative Office of the Pennsylvania Courts (‘‘AOPC’’) has implemented an interpreter program for judicial proceedings. See 204 Pa. Code §§ 221.101—.407. Information on the court interpreter program and a roster of court interpreters may be obtained from the
AOPC web site at www.pacourts.us/t/aopc/courtinterpreterprog.

Rule 605. Judge’s Competency as a Witness.
The presiding judge may not testify as a witness at the trial or other proceeding.
Comment
This rule differs from the first sentence of F.R.E. 605 with the inclusion of ‘‘or other proceeding.’’
Pa.R.E. 605 makes a judge absolutely incompetent to be a witness on any matter in any proceeding
at which the judge presides. Cf. Municipal Publications, Inc. v. Court of Common Pleas, 489 A.2d
1286 (Pa. 1985) (applying former Canon 3C of the Pennsylvania Code of Judicial Conduct, and holding that at a hearing on a motion to recuse a judge, the judge himself could not testify on the issues
raised in the motion and continue to preside at the hearing); see also Rule 2.11 of the Code of Judicial Conduct and the Rules Governing Standards of Conduct of Magisterial District Judges.
The second sentence of F.R.E. 605 which provides, ‘‘A party need not object to preserve the issue,’’
is not adopted. This is consistent with Pa.R.E. 103(a), which provides that error may not be predicated on a ruling admitting evidence in the absence of a timely objection, motion to strike, or motion
in limine. Of course, the court should permit the making of the objection out of the presence of the
jury. See Pa.R.E. 103(d).

Rule 606. Juror’s Competency as a Witness.
(a) At the Trial. A juror may not testify as a witness before the other jurors at
the trial. If a juror is called to testify, the court must give a party an opportunity
to object outside the jury’s presence.
(b) During an Inquiry into the Validity of a Verdict
(1) Prohibited Testimony or Other Evidence. During an inquiry into the
validity of a verdict, a juror may not testify about any statement made or incident that occurred during the jury’s deliberations; the effect of anything on that
juror’s or another juror’s vote; or any juror’s mental processes concerning the
verdict. The court may not receive a juror’s affidavit or evidence of a juror’s
statement on these matters.
(2) Exceptions. A juror may testify about whether:
(A) prejudicial information not of record and beyond common knowledge and experience was improperly brought to the jury’s attention; or
(B) an outside influence was improperly brought to bear on any juror.
Comment
Pa.R.E. 606(a) is identical to F.R.E. 606(a). Note that this paragraph bars a juror from testifying
‘‘before the other jurors at the trial.’’ That phrase indicates that a juror may testify outside the presence of the rest of the jury on matters occurring during the course of the trial. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Santiago, 456 Pa. 265, 318 A.2d 737 (1974) (jurors permitted to testify at hearing in chambers during trial on question of whether they received improper prejudicial information).
Pa.R.E. 606(b) differs from F.R.E. 606(b). First, the words, ‘‘extraneous prejudicial information’’
in F.R.E. 606(b)(2)(A) have been replaced by the phrase ‘‘prejudicial information not of record and
beyond common knowledge and experience.’’ This makes clear that the exception is directed at evidence brought before the jury which was not presented during the trial, and which was not tested by
the processes of the adversary system and subjected to judicial screening for a determination of
admissibility. The qualification of ‘‘common knowledge and experience’’ is a recognition that all
jurors bring with them some common facts of life.
Second, the word ‘‘indictment’’ has been omitted because challenges to indicting grand juries and
jurors are the subject of Pa.R.Crim.P. 556.4.
Third, Pa.R.E. 606(b)(2) does not contain the third exception to juror incompetency that appears in
F.R.E. 606(b)(2)(C)—permitting juror testimony about whether there was a mistake in entering the
verdict onto the verdict form. Pennsylvania law deals with possible mistakes in the verdict form by
permitting the polling of the jury prior to the recording of the verdict. If there is no concurrence, the
jury is directed to retire for further deliberations. See Pa.R.Crim.P. 648(G); City of Pittsburgh v.
Dinardo, 410 Pa. 376, 189 A.2d 886 (1963); Barefoot v. Penn Central Transportation Co., 226 Pa.
Super. 558, 323 A.2d 271 (1974).
Pa.R.E. 606(b) does not purport to set forth the substantive grounds for setting aside verdicts
because of an irregularity.

Rule 607. Who May Impeach a Witness, Evidence to Impeach a Witness.
(a) Who May Impeach a Witness. Any party, including the party that called
the witness, may attack the witness’s credibility.
(b) Evidence to Impeach a Witness. The credibility of a witness may be
impeached by any evidence relevant to that issue, except as otherwise provided
by statute or these rules.
Comment
Pa.R.E. 607(a) is identical to F.R.E. 607. It abolishes the common law rule that prohibited a party
from impeaching a witness called by that party.
The Federal Rules have no provision similar to Pa.R.E. 607(b). Pa.R.E. 607(b) applies the test for
relevant evidence of Pa.R.E. 401 to evidence offered to impeach the credibility of a witness. As is the
case under Pa.R.E. 402, there are limits on the admissibility of evidence relevant to the credibility of
a witness imposed by these rules. For example, Pa.R.E. 403 excludes relevant evidence if its probative value is outweighed by danger of unfair prejudice, etc., and there are specific limitations on
impeachment imposed by Rules 608, 609 and 610. There are statutory limitations such as 18 Pa.C.S.
§ 3104 (Rape Shield Law).
Pa.R.E. 607(b), however, is not curtailed by 42 Pa.C.S. § 5918, which prohibits, with certain
exceptions, the questioning of a defendant who testifies in a criminal case for the purpose of showing
that the defendant has committed, been convicted of or charged with another offense or that the
defendant has a bad character or reputation. In Commonwealth v. Bighum, 452 Pa. 554, 307 A.2d 255
(1973), this statute was interpreted to apply only to cross-examination. Hence, it affects only the timing and method of impeachment of a defendant; it does not bar the impeachment entirely.

Rule 608. A Witness’s Character for Truthfulness or Untruthfulness.
(a) Reputation Evidence. A witness’s credibility may be attacked or supported
by testimony about the witness’s reputation for having a character for truthfulness
or untruthfulness. But evidence of truthful character is admissible only after the
witness’s character for truthfulness has been attacked. Opinion testimony about
the witness’s character for truthfulness or untruthfulness is not admissible.
(b) Specific Instances of Conduct. Except as provided in Rule 609 (relating
to evidence of conviction of crime),
(1) the character of a witness for truthfulness may not be attacked or supported by cross-examination or extrinsic evidence concerning specific instances
of the witness’ conduct; however,
(2) in the discretion of the court, the credibility of a witness who testifies
as to the reputation of another witness for truthfulness or untruthfulness may
be attacked by cross-examination concerning specific instances of conduct (not
including arrests) of the other witness, if they are probative of truthfulness or
untruthfulness; but extrinsic evidence thereof is not admissible.
Comment
Pa.R.E. 608(a) differs from F.R.E. 608(a) in that the Federal Rule permits character for truthfulness or untruthfulness to be attacked or supported by testimony about the witness’s reputation or by
opinion testimony. Under Pa.R.E. 608(a), opinion testimony is not admissible. This approach is consistent with Pennsylvania law. See Commonwealth v. Lopinson, 427 Pa. 284, 234 A.2d 552 (1967),
vacated on other grounds, 392 U.S. 647 (1968). Compare Pa.R.E. 405(a).
Pa.R.E. 608(b)(1) differs from F.R.E. 608(b). Pa.R.E. 608(b)(1) prohibits the use of evidence of
specific instances of conduct to support or attack credibility. This is consistent with Pennsylvania law.
See Commonwealth v. Cragle, 281 Pa. Super. 434, 422 A.2d 547 (1980). F.R.E. 608(b)(1) prohibits
the use of extrinsic evidence for this purpose, but permits cross-examination of a witness about specific instances of conduct reflecting on the witness’s credibility within the court’s discretion. Both the
Pennsylvania and the Federal Rule refer the issue of attacking a witness’s credibility with evidence of
prior convictions to Rule 609.
Pa.R.E. 608(b)(2) is similar to F.R.E. 608(b); it permits a witness who has testified to another witness’s character for truthfulness to be cross-examined, about specific instances of conduct of the principal witness, in the discretion of the court. Pa.R.E. 608(b)(2) makes it clear that although the crossexamination concerns the specific acts of the principal witness, that evidence affects the credibility of
the character witness only. This is in accord with Pennsylvania law. See Commonwealth v. Peterkin,
511 Pa. 299, 513 A.2d 373 (1986); Commonwealth v. Adams, 426 Pa. Super. 332, 626 A.2d 1231
(1993). In addition, Pa.R.E. 608(b)(2) excludes the use of arrests; this, too, is consistent with Pennsylvania law. See Commonwealth v. Scott, 496 Pa. 188, 436 A.2d 607 (1981). Because crossexamination concerning specific instances of conduct is subject to abuse, the cross-examination is not
automatic; rather, its use is specifically placed in the discretion of the court, and like all other relevant
evidence, it is subject to the balancing test of Pa.R.E. 403. Moreover, the court should take care that
the cross-examiner has a reasonable basis for the questions asked. See Adams, supra.
Finally, the last paragraph of F.R.E. 608(b), which provides that the giving of testimony by an
accused or any other witness is not a waiver of the privilege against self-incrimination when the
examination concerns matters relating only to credibility, is not adopted.

false statement.
(b) Limit on Using the Evidence After 10 Years. This subdivision (b) applies
if more than 10 years have passed since the witness’s conviction or release from
confinement for it, whichever is later. Evidence of the conviction is admissible
only if:
(1) its probative value substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect; and
(2) the proponent gives an adverse party reasonable written notice of the
intent to use it so that the party has a fair opportunity to contest its use.
(c) Effect of Pardon or Other Equivalent Procedure. Evidence of a conviction
is not admissible under this rule if the conviction has been the subject of one of
the following:
(1) a pardon or other equivalent procedure based on a specific finding of
innocence; or
(2) a pardon or other equivalent procedure based on a specific finding of
rehabilitation of the person convicted, and that person has not been convicted
of any subsequent crime.
(d) Juvenile Adjudications. In a criminal case only, evidence of the adjudication of delinquency for an offense under the Juvenile Act, 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 6301 et
seq., may be used to impeach the credibility of a witness if conviction of the
offense would be admissible to attack the credibility of an adult.
(e) Pendency of an Appeal. A conviction that satisfies this rule is admissible
even if an appeal is pending. Evidence of the pendency is also admissible.
Comment
Pa.R.E. 609(a) differs from F.R.E. 609(a). It is designed to be consistent with Pennsylvania case
law. See Commonwealth v. Randall, 515 Pa. 410, 528 A.2d 1326 (1987); Commonwealth v. Bighum,
452 Pa. 554, 307 A.2d 255 (1973). In addition, Pa.R.E. 609(a), unlike F.R.E. 609(a)(2), specifically
provides that a conviction based upon a plea of nolo contendere may be used to attack the credibility
of a witness; this, too, is consistent with prior Pennsylvania case law. See Commonwealth v. Snyder,
408 Pa. 253, 182 A.2d 495 (1962).
225 Rule 609 RULES OF EVIDENCE

(365884) No. 461 Apr. 13 Copyright  2013 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
As a general rule, evidence of a jury verdict of guilty or a plea of guilty or nolo contendere may
not be used to attack the credibility of a witness before the court has pronounced sentence. See Commonwealth v. Zapata, 455 Pa. 205, 314 A.2d 299 (1974). In addition, evidence of admission to an
Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition program under Pa.R.Crim.P. 310—320 may not be used to
attack credibility. See Commonwealth v. Krall, 290 Pa. Super. 1, 434 A.2d 99 (1981).
42 Pa.C.S. § 5918 provides (with certain exceptions) that when a defendant in a criminal case has
been called to testify in his or her own behalf he or she cannot be cross-examined about prior convictions. However, evidence of a prior conviction or convictions of a crime or crimes admissible
under paragraph (a) may be introduced in rebuttal after the defendant has testified. See Commonwealth v. Bighum, 452 Pa. 554, 307 A.2d 255 (1973).
Pa.R.E. 609(b) differs slightly from F.R.E. 609(b) in that the phrase ‘‘supported by specific facts
and circumstances,’’ used in F.R.E. 609(b)(1) with respect to the balancing of probative value and
prejudicial effect, has been eliminated. Pa.R.E. 609(b) basically tracks what was said in Commonwealth v. Randall, 515 Pa. 410, 528 A.2d 1326 (1987). Where the date of conviction or last date of
confinement is within ten years of the trial, evidence of the conviction of a crimen falsi is per se
admissible. If more than ten years have elapsed, the evidence may be used only after written notice
and the trial judge’s determination that its probative value substantially outweighs its prejudicial
effect. The relevant factors for making this determination are set forth in Bighum, supra, and Commonwealth v. Roots, 482 Pa. 33, 393 A.2d 364 (1978). For the computation of the ten-year period,
where there has been a reincarceration because of a parole violation, see Commonwealth v. Jackson,
526 Pa. 294, 585 A.2d 1001 (1991).
Pa.R.E. 609(c) differs from F.R.E. 609(c) because the Federal Rule includes procedures that are not
provided by Pennsylvania law.
Pa.R.E. 609(d) differs from F.R.E. 609(d). Under the latter, evidence of juvenile adjudications is
generally inadmissible to impeach credibility, except in criminal cases against a witness other than the
accused where the court finds that the evidence is necessary for a fair determination of guilt or innocence. Pa.R.E. 609(d), to be consistent with 42 Pa.C.S. § 6354(b)(4), permits a broader use; a juvenile adjudication of an offense may be used to impeach in a criminal case if conviction of the offense
would be admissible if committed by an adult. Juvenile adjudications may also be admissible for other
purposes. See 42 Pa.C.S. § 6354(b)(1), (2), and (3).
Pa.R.E. 609(e) is identical to F.R.E. 609(e).

Evidence of a witness’s religious beliefs or opinions is not admissible to attack

WITNESSES 225 Rule 610
6-9
(373777) No. 481 Dec. 14
Comment
This rule is identical to F.R.E. 610. It is consistent with 42 Pa.C.S. § 5902, which provides that
religious beliefs and opinions shall not affect a person’s ‘‘capacity’’ to testify, that no witness shall be
questioned about those beliefs or opinions, and that no evidence shall be heard on those subjects for
the purpose of affecting ‘‘competency or credibility.’’
Pa.R.E. 610 bars evidence of a witness’s religious beliefs or opinions only when offered to show
that the beliefs or opinions affect the witness’s truthfulness. Pa.R.E. 610 does not bar such evidence
introduced for other purposes. See McKim v. Philadelphia Transp. Co., 364 Pa. 237, 72 A.2d 122
(1950); Commonwealth v. Riggins, 374 Pa. Super. 243, 542 A.2d 1004 (1988).

Rule 611. Mode and Order of Examining Witnesses and Presenting Evidence.
(a) Control by the Court; Purposes. The court should exercise reasonable
control over the mode and order of examining witnesses and presenting evidence
so as to:
(1) make those procedures effective for determining the truth;
(2) avoid wasting time; and
(3) protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.
(b) Scope of Cross-Examination. Cross-examination of a witness other than a
party in a civil case should be limited to the subject matter of the direct examination and matters affecting credibility, however, the court may, in the exercise
of discretion, permit inquiry into additional matters as if on direct examination. A
party witness in a civil case may be cross-examined by an adverse party on any
matter relevant to any issue in the case, including credibility, unless the court, in
the interests of justice, limits the cross-examination with respect to matters not
testified to on direct examination.
(c) Leading Questions. Leading questions should not be used on direct or
redirect examination except as necessary to develop the witness’s testimony.
Ordinarily, the court should allow leading questions:
(1) on cross-examination; and
(2) when a party calls a hostile witness, an adverse party, or a witness
identified with an adverse party. A witness so examined should usually be
interrogated by all other parties as to whom the witness is not hostile or adverse
as if under redirect examination.
Comment
Pa.R.E. 611(a) is identical to F.R.E. 611(a).
Pa.R.E. 611(b) differs from F.R.E. 611(b). F.R.E. 611(b) limits the scope of cross-examination of
all witnesses to matters testified to on direct and matters bearing on credibility, unless the court in its
discretion allows inquiry into additional matters as if on direct examination. This has been the traditional view in the Federal courts and many State courts. The cross-examiner does not lose the oppor225 Rule 611 RULES OF EVIDENCE
6-10
(373778) No. 481 Dec. 14 Copyright  2014 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
tunity to develop the evidence because, unless the witness is the accused in a criminal case, the crossexaminer may call the witness as his or her own. Therefore, the introduction of the evidence is merely
deferred.
Pa.R.E. 611(b), which is based on Pennsylvania law, applies the traditional view in both civil and
criminal cases to all witnesses except a party in a civil case. Under Pa.R.E. 611(b), a party in a civil
case may be cross-examined on all relevant issues and matters affecting credibility. See Agate v. Dunleavy, 156 A.2d 530 (Pa. 1959); Greenfield v. Philadelphia, 127 A. 768 (Pa. 1925). However, in both
of those cases, the Court stated that the broadened scope of cross-examination of a party in a civil
case does not permit a defendant to put in a defense through cross-examination of the plaintiff. The
qualifying clause in the last sentence of Pa.R.E. 611(b) is intended to give the trial judge discretion
to follow this longstanding rule.
When the accused in a criminal case is the witness, there is an interplay between the limited scope
of cross-examination and the accused’s privilege against self-incrimination. When the accused testifies generally as to facts tending to negate or raise doubts about the prosecution’s evidence, he or she
has waived the privilege and may not use it to prevent the prosecution from bringing out on crossexamination every circumstance related to those facts. See Commonwealth v. Green, 581 A.2d 544
(Pa. 1990). However, when the accused’s testimony is limited to a narrow topic, there is some authority that the scope of cross-examination may be limited as well. See Commonwealth v. Camm, 277
A.2d 325 (Pa. 1971); Commonwealth v. Ulen, 607 A.2d 779 (Pa. Super. 1992), rev’d on other grounds,
650 A.2d 416 (Pa. 1994).
Pa.R.E. 611(c) differs from F.R.E. 611(c) in that the word ‘‘redirect’’ has been added to the first
sentence. This is consistent with Pennsylvania law. See Commonwealth v. Reidenbaugh, 422 A.2d
1126 (Pa. Super. 1980). Additionally, the last sentence of Pa.R.E. 611(c)(2) includes a clause providing that when the court gives permission to use leading questions to a party who has called a hostile
witness, an adverse party or one identified with an adverse party, the court should not extend that permission to other parties to whom the witness is not hostile or adverse.
A party who calls a hostile witness, adverse party or one identified with an adverse party may use
leading questions because these witnesses are ‘‘unfriendly’’ to the party calling them and there is little
risk that they will be susceptible to any suggestions inherent in the questions. The risk of susceptibility to suggestion is present, however, when a party to whom the witness is ‘‘friendly’’ (i.e. to whom
the witness is not hostile, an adverse party or one identified with an adverse party) interrogates the
witness. The last clause of Pa.R.E. 611(c) restricts the use of leading questions by a party to whom
the witness is ‘‘friendly.’’ The word ‘‘usually’’, however, was included to give the court discretion to
permit leading questions in an appropriate case. For example, leading questions may be appropriate
when the testimony of a witness who was called and examined as a hostile witness by one party substantially harms the interest of another party with whom the witness is neither friendly nor unfriendly.

(b) Rights of Adverse Party.
WITNESSES 225 Rule 612
6-11
(373779) No. 481 Dec. 14
(1) If a witness uses a writing or other item to refresh memory while testifying, an adverse party is entitled to have it produced at the hearing, trial or
deposition, to inspect it, to cross-examine the witness about it, and to introduce
in evidence any portion that relates to the witness’s testimony.
(2) If a witness uses a writing or other item to refresh memory before testifying, and the court in its discretion determines it is necessary in the interests
of justice, an adverse party is entitled to have it produced at the hearing, trial
or deposition, to inspect it, to cross-examine the witness about it, and to introduce in evidence any portion that relates to the witness’s testimony.
(c) Rights of Producing Party. If the producing party claims that the writing
or other item includes unrelated matter, the court must examine it in camera,
delete any unrelated portion, and order that the rest be delivered to the adverse
party. Any portion deleted over objection must be preserved for the record.
(d) Failure to Produce or Deliver. If the writing or other item is not produced
or is not delivered as ordered, the court may issue any appropriate order. But if
the prosecution does not comply in a criminal case, the court must strike the witness’s testimony or—if justice so requires—declare a mistrial, or the court may
use contempt procedures.
Comment
Pa.R.E. 612 differs from F.R.E. in several ways:
Pa.R.E. 612 applies to writings and other items. This would include such things as photographs,
videos, and recordings. F.R.E 612 applies only to writings. The Pennsylvania rule is consistent with
prior law. See Commonwealth v. Proctor, 253 Pa. Super. 369, 385 A.2d 383 (1978).
Pa.R.E. 612(a) states that a witness or a party has a right to refresh recollection. This is not
expressly provided by F.R.E. 612.
Pa.R.E. 612(b) reorganizes the material that appears in F.R.E. 612(a) and the first sentence of
F.R.E. 612(b) for clarity, includes the word ‘‘deposition’’ to clarify that the rule is applicable both at
hearings and depositions, and deletes reference to 18 U.S.C. § 3500.
Paragraph (c) differs from the second sentence of F.R.E. 612(b) in that it refers to other items as
well as writings.
Paragraph (d) differs from F.R.E. 612(c) in that it adds the phrase ‘‘or the court may use contempt
procedures’’.

Rule 613. Witness’s Prior Inconsistent Statement to Impeach; Witness’s
Prior Consistent Statement to Rehabilitate.
(a) Witness’s Prior Inconsistent Statement to Impeach. A witness may be
examined concerning a prior inconsistent statement made by the witness to
impeach the witness’s credibility. The statement need not be shown or its contents
disclosed to the witness at that time, but on request, the statement or contents
must be shown or disclosed to an adverse party’s attorney.
(b) Extrinsic Evidence of a Witness’s Prior Inconsistent Statement. Unless the
interests of justice otherwise require, extrinsic evidence of a witness’s prior
inconsistent statement is admissible only if, during the examination of the witness,
(1) the statement, if written, is shown to, or if not written, its contents are
disclosed to, the witness;
(2) the witness is given an opportunity to explain or deny the making of
the statement; and
(3) an adverse party is given an opportunity to question the witness.
This subdivision does not apply to an opposing party’s statement as defined in
Rule 803(25).
(c) Witness’s Prior Consistent Statement to Rehabilitate. Evidence of a witness’s prior consistent statement is admissible to rehabilitate the witness’s credibility if the opposing party is given an opportunity to cross-examine the witness
about the statement and the statement is offered to rebut an express or implied
charge of:
(1) fabrication, bias, improper influence or motive, or faulty memory, provided that the statement was made before the alleged fabrication, bias,
improper influence or motive, or faulty memory arose; or
(2) having made a prior inconsistent statement, which the witness has
denied or explained, and the consistent statement supports the witness’s denial
or explanation.
Comment:
Pa.R.E. 613 differs from F.R.E. 613 to clarify its meaning and to conform to Pennsylvania law.
Pa.R.E. 613(a) and (b) are similar to F.R.E. 613(a) and (b), but the headings and the substance
make it clear that the subdivisions are dealing with the use of an inconsistent statement to impeach.
The disclosure requirement in subdivision (a) is intended to deter sham allegations of the existence of
an inconsistent statement.
Pa.R.E. 613(b) differs from F.R.E. 613(b) in that extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement is not admissible unless the statement is shown or disclosed to the witness during the witness’s
examination. Subdivision (b) is intended to give the witness and the party a fair opportunity to explain
or deny the allegation.
To be used for impeachment purposes, an inconsistent statement need not satisfy the requirements
of Pa.R.E. 803.1(1)(A)—(C).
F.R.E. 613 does not contain a subdivision (c); it does not deal with rehabilitation of a witness with
a prior consistent statement. Pa.R.E. 613(c) gives a party an opportunity to rehabilitate the witness
WITNESSES 225 Rule 613
6-13
(420669) No. 601 Dec. 24
with a prior consistent statement where there has been an attempt to impeach the witness. In most
cases, a witness’s prior statement is hearsay, but F.R.E. 801(d)(1)(B) treats some prior consistent
statements offered to rebut impeachment as not hearsay.
Pa.R.E. 613(c) is consistent with Pennsylvania law in that the prior consistent statement is admissible, but only to rehabilitate the witness. See Commonwealth v. Hutchinson, 556 A.2d 370 (Pa. 1989)
(to rebut charge of recent fabrication); Commonwealth v. Smith, 540 A.2d 246 (Pa. 1988) (to counter
alleged corrupt motive); Commonwealth v. Swinson, 626 A.2d 627 (Pa. Super. 1993) (to negate charge
of faulty memory); Commonwealth v. McEachin, 537 A.2d 883 (Pa. Super. 1988) (to offset implication of improper influence).
Pa.R.E. 613(c)(2) is arguably an extension of Pennsylvania law, but is based on the premise that,
when an attempt has been made to impeach a witness with an alleged prior inconsistent statement, a
statement consistent with the witness’s testimony should be admissible to rehabilitate the witness if it
supports the witness’s denial or explanation of the alleged inconsistent statement.

Rule 614. Court’s Calling or Examining a Witness.
(a) Calling. Consistent with its function as an impartial arbiter, the court, with
notice to the parties, may call a witness on its own or at a party’s request. Each
party is entitled to cross-examine the witness.
(b) Examining. Where the interest of justice so requires, the court may examine a witness regardless of who calls the witness.
(c) Objections. A party may object to the court’s calling or examining a witness when given notice that the witness will be called or when the witness is
examined. When requested to do so, the court must give the objecting party an
opportunity to make objections out of the presence of the jury.
Comment
Pa.R.E. 614(a) and (b) differ from F.R.E. 614(a) and (b) in several respects. The phrase relating to
the court’s ‘‘function as an impartial arbiter’’ has been added to Pa.R.E. 614(a), and the clause
regarding ‘‘interest of justice’’ has been added in Pa.R.E. 614(b). These additions are consistent with
Pennsylvania law. See Commonwealth v. Crews, 429 Pa. 16, 239 A.2d 350 (1968); Commonwealth v.
DiPasquale, 424 Pa. 500, 230 A.2d 449 (1967); Commonwealth v. Myma, 278 Pa. 505, 123 A. 486

Pa.R.E. 614(a) also differs from F.R.E. 614(a) in that the Pennsylvania Rule requires the court to
give notice of its intent to call a witness.
Pa.R.E. 614(c), unlike F.R.E. 614(c), does not permit an objection to the court’s calling or questioning a witness ‘‘at the next available opportunity when the jury is not present.’’ Pa.R.E. 614(c) is
consistent with Pa.R.E. 103(a)(1)(A), which requires a ‘‘timely objection.’’ The requirement that the
objecting party be given an opportunity make its objection out of the presence of the jury is consistent with Pa.R.E. 103(d).

Rule 615. Sequestering Witnesses.
At a party’s request the court may order witnesses sequestered so that they
cannot learn of other witnesses’ testimony. Or the court may do so on its own.
But this rule does not authorize sequestering:
(a) a party who is a natural person;
(b) an officer or employee of a party that is not a natural person (including
the Commonwealth) after being designated as the party’s representative by its
attorney;
(c) a person whose presence a party shows to be essential to presenting the
party’s claim or defense; or
(d) a person authorized by statute or rule to be present.
Comment
Pa.R.E. 615 differs from F.R.E. 615 in that the word ‘‘sequestering’’ is used instead of the word
‘‘excluding’’, and the rule is discretionary not mandatory. Both of these are consistent with prior
Pennsylvania law. See Commonwealth v. Albrecht, 510 Pa. 603, 511 A.2d 764 (1986). Pa.R.E. 615
uses the term ‘‘learn of’’ rather than the word ‘‘hear.’’ This indicates that the court’s order may prohibit witnesses from using other means of learning of the testimony of other witnesses.
Pa.R.E. 615(b) adds the parenthetical ‘‘(including the Commonwealth).’’
Pa.R.E 615(d) differs from the Federal Rule in that it adds the words ‘‘or rule.’’ This includes persons such as the guardian of a minor, see Pa.R.C.P. No. 2027, and the guardian of an incapacitated
person, see Pa.R.C.P. No. 2053.
The trial court has discretion in choosing a remedy for violation of a sequestration order. See Commonwealth v. Smith, 464 Pa. 314, 346 A.2d 757 (1975). Remedies include ordering a mistrial, forbidding the testimony of the offending witness, or an instruction to the jury. Commonwealth v. Scott, 496

Rule 701. Opinion Testimony by Lay Witnesses.
If a witness is not testifying as an expert, testimony in the form of an opinion
is limited to one that is:
(a) rationally based on the witness’s perception;
(b) helpful to clearly understanding the witness’s testimony or to determining
a fact in issue; and
(c) not based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge within
the scope of Rule 702.
Comment
This rule is identical to F.R.E. 701.
On January 17, 2013, the Rules of Evidence were rescinded and replaced. See Pa.R.E. 101, Comment. Within Article VII, the term ‘‘inference’’ has been eliminated when used in conjunction with
‘‘opinion.’’ The term ‘‘inference’’ is subsumed by the broader term ‘‘opinion’’ and Pennsylvania case
law has not made a substantive decision on the basis of any distinction between an opinion and an
inference. No change in the current practice was intended with the elimination of this term.

Rule 702. Testimony by Expert Witnesses.
A witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:
(a) the expert’s scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge is beyond
that possessed by the average layperson;
OPINIONS AND EXPERT TESTIMONY 225 Rule 701

(365893) No. 461 Apr. 13
(b) the expert’s scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help
the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue; and
(c) the expert’s methodology is generally accepted in the relevant field.
Comment
Pa.R.E. 702(a) and (b) differ from F.R.E. 702 in that Pa.R.E. 702(a) and (b) impose the requirement that the expert’s scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge is admissible only if it is
beyond that possessed by the average layperson. This is consistent with prior Pennsylvania law. See
Commonwealth v. O’Searo, 466 Pa. 224, 229, 352 A.2d 30, 32 (1976).
Pa.R.E. 702(c) differs from F.R.E. 702 in that it reflects Pennsylvania’s adoption of the standard in
Frye v. United States, 293 F. 1013 (D.C. Cir. 1923). The rule applies the ‘‘general acceptance’’ test
for the admissibility of scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge testimony. This is consistent with prior Pennsylvania law. See Grady v. Frito-Lay, Inc., 576 Pa. 546, 839 A.2d 1038 (2003).
The rule rejects the federal test derived from Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S.
579 (1993).
Pa.R.E. 702 does not change the Pennsylvania rule for qualifying a witness to testify as an expert.
In Miller v. Brass Rail Tavern, Inc., 541 Pa. 474, 480-81, 664 A.2d 525, 528 (1995), the Supreme
Court stated:
The test to be applied when qualifying a witness to testify as an expert witness is whether the
witness has any reasonable pretension to specialized knowledge on the subject under investigation. If he does, he may testify and the weight to be given to such testimony is for the trier of
fact to determine.
Pa.R.E. 702 does not change the requirement that an expert’s opinion must be expressed with reasonable certainty. See McMahon v. Young, 442 Pa. 484, 276 A.2d 534 (1971).
Pa.R.E. 702 states that an expert may testify in the form of an ‘‘opinion or otherwise.’’ Much of
the literature assumes that experts testify only in the form of an opinion. The language ‘‘or otherwise’’
reflects the fact that experts frequently are called upon to educate the trier of fact about the scientific
or technical principles relevant to the case.

Rule 703. Bases of an Expert’s Opinion Testimony.
An expert may base an opinion on facts or data in the case that the expert has
been made aware of or personally observed. If experts in the particular field
would reasonably rely on those kinds of facts or data in forming an opinion on
the subject, they need not be admissible for the opinion to be admitted.
225 Rule 703 RULES OF EVIDENCE
7-2
(365894) No. 461 Apr. 13 Copyright  2013 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
Comment
This rule is identical to the first two sentences of F.R.E. 703. It does not include the third sentence
of the Federal Rule that provides that the facts and data that are the bases for the expert’s opinion are
not admissible unless their probative value substantially outweighs their prejudicial effect. This is
inconsistent with Pennsylvania law which requires that facts and data that are the bases for the
expert’s opinion must be disclosed to the trier of fact. See Pa.R.E. 705.
Pa.R.E. 703 requires that the facts or data upon which an expert witness bases an opinion be ‘‘of
a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field. . . .’’ Whether the facts or data satisfy
this requirement is a preliminary question to be determined by the trial court under Pa.R.E. 104(a). If
an expert witness relies on novel scientific evidence, Pa.R.C.P. No. 207.1 sets forth the procedure for
objecting, by pretrial motion, on the ground that the testimony is inadmissible under Pa.R.E. 702, or
Pa.R.E. 703, or both.
When an expert testifies about the underlying facts and data that support the expert’s opinion and
the evidence would be otherwise inadmissible, the trial judge upon request must, or on the judge’s
own initiative may, instruct the jury to consider the facts and data only to explain the basis for the
expert’s opinion, and not as substantive evidence.
An expert witness cannot be a mere conduit for the opinion of another. An expert witness may not
relate the opinion of a non-testifying expert unless the witness has reasonably relied upon it in forming the witness’s own opinion. See, e.g., Foster v. McKeesport Hospital, 260 Pa. Super. 485, 394 A.2d
1031 (1978); Allen v. Kaplan, 439 Pa. Super. 263, 653 A.2d 1249 (1995).

An opinion is not objectionable just because it embraces an ultimate issue.
Comment
Pa.R.E. 704 is identical to F.R.E. 704(a).
F.R.E. 704(b) is not adopted. The Federal Rule prohibits an expert witness in a criminal case from
stating an opinion about whether the defendant did or did not have a mental state or condition that
constitutes an element of the crime charged or a defense. This is inconsistent with Pennsylvania law.

Rule 705. Disclosing the Facts or Data Underlying an Expert’s Opinion.
If an expert states an opinion the expert must state the facts or data on which
the opinion is based.
Comment
The text and substance of Pa.R.E. 705 differ significantly from F.R.E. 705. The Federal Rule generally does not require an expert witness to disclose the facts upon which an opinion is based prior
to expressing the opinion. Instead, the cross-examiner bears the burden of probing the basis of the
opinion. Pennsylvania does not follow the Federal Rule. See Kozak v. Struth, 515 Pa. 554, 560, 531
A.2d 420, 423 (1987) (declining to adopt F.R.E. 705, the Court reasoned that ‘‘requiring the proponent of an expert opinion to clarify for the jury the assumptions upon which the opinion is based
avoids planting in the juror’s mind a general statement likely to remain with him in the jury room
when the disputed details are lost.’’) Relying on cross-examination to illuminate the underlying
assumption, as F.R.E. 705 does, may further confuse jurors already struggling to follow complex testimony. Id.
Accordingly, Kozak requires disclosure of the facts used by the expert in forming an opinion. The
disclosure can be accomplished in several ways. One way is to ask the expert to assume the truth of
testimony the expert has heard or read. Kroeger Co. v. W.C.A.B., 101 Pa. Cmwlth. 629, 516 A.2d 1335
(1986); Tobash v. Jones, 419 Pa. 205, 213 A.2d 588 (1965). Another option is to pose a hypothetical
question to the expert. Dietrich v. J.I. Case Co., 390 Pa. Super. 475, 568 A.2d 1272 (1990); Hussey
v. May Department Stores, Inc., 238 Pa. Super. 431, 357 A.2d 635 (1976).
When an expert testifies about the underlying facts and data that support the expert’s opinion and
the evidence would be otherwise inadmissible, the trial judge upon request must, or on the judge’s
own initiative may, instruct the jury to consider the facts and data only to explain the basis for the
expert’s opinion, and not as substantive evidence.

testify by the court or any party. The witness shall be subject to crossexamination by any party, including a party calling the witness. In civil cases, the
witness’s deposition may be taken by any party.
Comment
Pa.R.E. 706 differs from F.R.E. 706. Unlike the Federal Rule, Pa.R.E. 706 does not affect the scope
of the trial court’s power to appoint experts. Pa.R.E. 706 provides only the procedures for obtaining
the testimony of experts after the court has appointed them.
In Commonwealth v. Correa, 437 Pa. Super. 1, 648 A.2d 1199 (1994), abrogated on other grounds
by Commonwealth v. Weston, 561 Pa. 199, 749 A.2d 458 (2000), the Superior Court held that the trial
court had inherent power to appoint an expert. 23 Pa.C.S. § 5104 provides for the appointment of
experts to conduct blood tests in paternity proceedings.

HEARSAY 225 Rule 801
8-1
(395491) No. 532 Mar. 19
Rule 801. Definitions That Apply to This Article.
(a) Statement. ‘‘Statement’’ means a person’s oral assertion, written assertion,
or nonverbal conduct, if the person intended it as an assertion.
(b) Declarant. ‘‘Declarant’’ means the person who made the statement.
(c) Hearsay. ‘‘Hearsay’’ means a statement that
(1) the declarant does not make while testifying at the current trial or hearing; and
(2) a party offers in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted in
the statement.
Comment
Pa.R.E. 801(a), (b) and (c) are identical to F.R.E. 801(a), (b) and (c). The matters set out in F.R.E.
801(d)(1) (A Declarant-Witness’s Prior Statement) are covered in Pa.R.E. 803.1(1) and (2) and
Pa.R.E. 613(c). The matters set out in F.R.E. 801(d)(2) (An Opposing Party’s Statement) are covered
in Pa.R.E. 803(25).
Communications that are not assertions are not hearsay. These would include questions, greetings,
expressions of gratitude, exclamations, offers, instructions, warnings, etc.
Pa.R.E. 801(c), which defines hearsay, is consistent with Pennsylvania law, although the Pennsylvania cases have usually defined hearsay as an ‘‘out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of
the matter asserted’’ instead of the definition used Pa.R.E. 801(c). See Heddings v. Steele, 514 Pa. 569,
526 A.2d 349 (1987). The adoption of the language of the Federal Rule is not intended to change
existing law.
A statement is hearsay only if it is offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement. There are many situations in which evidence of a statement is offered for a purpose other than
to prove the truth of the matter asserted.
Sometimes a statement has direct legal significance, whether or not it is true. For example, one or
more statements may constitute an offer, an acceptance, a promise, a guarantee, a notice, a representation, a misrepresentation, defamation, perjury, compliance with a contractual or statutory obligation,
etc.
More often, a statement, whether or not it is true, constitutes circumstantial evidence from which
the trier of fact may infer, alone or in combination with other evidence, the existence or non-existence
of a fact in issue. For example, a declarant’s statement may imply his or her particular state of mind,
or it may imply that a particular state of mind ensued in the recipient. Evidence of a statement, particularly if it is proven untrue by other evidence, may imply the existence of a conspiracy, or fraud.
Evidence of a statement made by a witness, if inconsistent with the witness’s testimony, may imply
that the witness is an unreliable historian. Conversely, evidence of a statement made by a witness that
is consistent with the witness’s testimony may imply the opposite. See Pa.R.E. 613(c).

Rule 802. The Rule Against Hearsay.
Hearsay is not admissible except as provided by these rules, by other rules prescribed by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, or by statute.
Comment
Pa.R.E. 802 differs from F.R.E. 802 in that it refers to other rules prescribed by the Pennsylvania
Supreme Court, and to statutes in general, rather than federal statutes.
Often, hearsay will be admissible under an exception provided by these rules. The organization of
the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence generally follows the organization of the Federal Rules of Evidence, but the Pennsylvania Rules’ organization of the exceptions to the hearsay rule is somewhat
different than the federal organization. There are three rules which contain the exceptions: Pa.R.E. 803
Exceptions to the Rule Against Hearsay—Regardless of Whether the Declarant is Available as a Witness, Pa.R.E. 803.1 Exceptions to the Rule Against Hearsay—Testimony of Declarant Necessary, and
Pa.R.E. 804 Exceptions to the Rule Against Hearsay—When the Declarant is Unavailable as a Witness.
On occasion, hearsay may be admitted pursuant to another rule promulgated by the Pennsylvania
Supreme Court. For example, in civil cases, all or part of a deposition may be admitted pursuant to
Pa.R.C.P. No. 4020, or a video deposition of an expert witness may be admitted pursuant to Pa.R.C.P.
No. 4017.1(g). In preliminary hearings in criminal cases, the court may consider hearsay evidence
pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 542(E) and 1003(E). In criminal trials, Pa.R.Crim.P. 574 provides a procedure for the admission of forensic laboratory reports supported by a certification.
Also, hearsay may be admitted pursuant to a state statute. Examples include:
1. A public record may be admitted pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 6104. See Comment to Pa.R.E.
803(8).
2. A record of vital statistics may be admitted pursuant to 35 P. S. § 450.810. See Comment to
Pa.R.E. 803(9) (Not Adopted).
3. In a civil case, a deposition of a licensed physician may be admitted pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S.
§ 5936.
4. In a criminal case, a deposition of a witness may be admitted pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 5919.
5. In a criminal or civil case, an out-of-court statement of a witness 12 years of age or younger,
describing certain kinds of sexual abuse, may be admitted pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 5985.1.
6. In a dependency hearing, an out-of-court statement of a witness under 16 years of age, describing certain types of sexual abuse, may be admitted pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 5986.
7. In a prosecution for speeding under the Pennsylvania Vehicle Code, a certificate of accuracy of
an electronic speed timing device (radar) from a calibration and testing station appointed by the
Pennsylvania Department of Motor Vehicles may be admitted pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. § 3368(d).
On rare occasion, hearsay may be admitted pursuant to a federal statute. For example, when a person brings a civil action, in either federal or state court, against a common carrier to enforce an order
of the Interstate Commerce Commission requiring the payment of damages, the findings and order of
the Commission may be introduced as evidence of the facts stated in them. 49 U.S.C. § 11704(d)(1).
HEARSAY 225 Rule 802
8-3
(384737) No. 507 Feb. 17
Hearsay Exceptions and the Right of Confrontation
of a Defendant in a Criminal Case
The exceptions to the hearsay rule in Rules 803, 803.1, and 804 and the exceptions provided by
other rules or by statute are applicable both in civil and criminal cases. In a criminal case, however,
hearsay that is offered against a defendant under an exception from the hearsay rule provided by these
rules or by another rule or statute may sometimes be excluded because its admission would violate
the defendant’s right ‘‘to be confronted with the witnesses against him’’ under the Sixth Amendment
of the United States Constitution, or ‘‘to be confronted with the witnesses against him’’ under Article
I, § 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.
The relationship between the hearsay rule and the Confrontation Clause in the Sixth Amendment
was explained by the United States Supreme Court in California v. Green, 399 U.S. 149, 155-56
(1970):
While it may readily be conceded that hearsay rules and the Confrontation Clause are generally
designed to protect similar values, it is quite a different thing to suggest that the overlap is complete and that the Confrontation Clause is nothing more or less than a codification of the rules
of hearsay and their exceptions as they existed historically at common law. Our decisions have
never established such a congruence; indeed, we have more than once found a violation of confrontation values even though the statements in issue were admitted under an arguably recognized hearsay exception....
Given the similarity of the values protected, however, the modification of a State’s hearsay rules
to create new exceptions for the admission of evidence against a defendant, will often raise
questions of compatibility with the defendant’s constitutional right to confrontation.
In Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004), the Supreme Court, overruling its prior opinion in
Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56 (1980), interpreted the Confrontation Clause to prohibit the introduction
of ‘‘testimonial’’ hearsay from an unavailable witness against a defendant in a criminal case unless
the defendant had an opportunity to confront and cross-examine the declarant, regardless of its exception from the hearsay rule, except, perhaps, if the hearsay qualifies as a dying declaration (Pa.R.E.
804(b)(2)).
In short, when hearsay is offered against a defendant in a criminal case, the defendant may interpose three separate objections: (1) admission of the evidence would violate the hearsay rule, (2)
admission of the evidence would violate defendant’s right to confront the witnesses against him under
the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution, and (3) admission of the evidence would violate defendant’s right ‘‘to be confronted with the witnesses against him’’ under Article I, § 9 of the
Pennsylvania Constitution.
Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 574 provides a mechanism for the admission of a forensic laboratory report supported by a certification. This Rule provides a defendant an opportunity to
exercise the right of confrontation and to object to the report on hearsay grounds. Following pre-trial

Rule 803(1). Present Sense Impression.
(1) Present Sense Impression. A statement describing or explaining an
event or condition, made while or immediately after the declarant perceived it.
When the declarant is unidentified, the proponent shall show by independent
corroborating evidence that the declarant actually perceived the event or condition.
Comment
This rule differs from F.R.E. 803(1) insofar as it requires independent corroborating evidence when
the declarant is unidentified. See Commonwealth v. Hood, 872 A.2d 175 (Pa. Super. 2005).
For this exception to apply, declarant need not be excited or otherwise emotionally affected by the
event or condition perceived. The trustworthiness of the statement arises from its timing. The requirement of contemporaneousness, or near contemporaneousness, reduces the chance of premeditated
prevarication or loss of memory.

Rule 803(2). Excited Utterance.
(2) Excited Utterance. A statement relating to a startling event or condition, made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement that it caused.
When the declarant is unidentified, the proponent shall show by independent
corroborating evidence that the declarant actually perceived the startling event
or condition.
HEARSAY 225 Rule 803
8-5
(407865) No. 568 Mar. 22
Comment
This rule differs from F.R.E. 803(2) insofar as it requires independent corroborating evidence when
the declarant is unidentified. See Commonwealth v, Upshur, 764 A.2d 69 (Pa. Super. 2000).
This exception has a more narrow base than the exception for a present sense impression, because
it requires an event or condition that is startling. However, it is broader in scope because an excited
utterance (1) need not describe or explain the startling event or condition; it need only relate to it,
and (2) need not be made contemporaneously with, or immediately after, the startling event. It is sufficient if the stress of excitement created by the startling event or condition persists as a substantial
factor in provoking the utterance.
There is no set time interval following a startling event or condition after which an utterance relating to it will be ineligible for exception to the hearsay rule as an excited utterance. In Commonwealth
v. Gore, 396 A.2d 1302, 1305 (Pa. Super. 1978), the court explained:
The declaration need not be strictly contemporaneous with the existing cause, nor is there a
definite and fixed time limit.... Rather, each case must be judged on its own facts, and a lapse
of time of several hours has not negated the characterization of a statement as an ‘‘excited utterance.’’ . . . The crucial question, regardless of the time lapse, is whether, at the time the statement is made, the nervous excitement continues to dominate while the reflective processes
remain in abeyance.

Rule 803(3). Then-Existing Mental, Emotional, or Physical Condition.
(3) Then-Existing Mental, Emotional, or Physical Condition. A statement
of the declarant’s then-existing state of mind (such as motive, intent, or plan)
or emotional, sensory, or physical condition (such as mental feeling, pain, or
bodily health), but not including a statement of memory or belief to prove the
fact remembered or believed unless it relates to the validity or terms of the
declarant’s will.
Comment
This rule is identical to F.R.E. 803(3). For the general inquiry that courts should undertake when
contemplating application of this rule, see Commonwealth v. Fitzpatrick, 255 A.3d 452, 479-480 (Pa.

Rule 803(4). Statement Made for Medical Diagnosis or Treatment.
(4) Statement Made for Medical Diagnosis or Treatment. A statement that:
(A) is made for—and is reasonably pertinent to—medical treatment or
diagnosis in contemplation of treatment; and
(B) describes medical history, past or present symptoms, pain, or sensations, or the inception or general character of the cause or external
source thereof, insofar as reasonably pertinent to treatment, or diagnosis in
contemplation of treatment.
Comment
Pa.R.E. 803(4) differs from F.R.E. 803(4) in that it permits admission of statements made for purposes of medical diagnosis only if they are made in contemplation of treatment. Statements made to
persons retained solely for the purpose of litigation are not admissible under this rule. The rationale
for admitting statements for purposes of treatment is that the declarant has a very strong motivation
225 Rule 803(3) RULES OF EVIDENCE
8-6
(407866) No. 568 Mar. 22 Copyright  2022 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
to speak truthfully. This rationale is not applicable to statements made for purposes of litigation.
Pa.R.E. 803(4) is consistent with Pennsylvania law. See Commonwealth v. Smith, 545 Pa. 487, 681
A.2d 1288 (1996).
An expert medical witness may base an opinion on the declarant’s statements of the kind discussed
in this rule, even though the statements were not made for purposes of treatment, if the statements
comply with Pa.R.E. 703. Such statements may be disclosed as provided in Pa.R.E. 705, but are not
substantive evidence.
This rule is not limited to statements made to physicians. Statements to a nurse have been held to
be admissible. See Smith, supra. Statements as to causation may be admissible, but statements as to
fault or identification of the person inflicting harm have been held to be inadmissible. See Smith,
supra.

Rule 803(6). Records of a Regularly Conducted Activity.
(6) Records of a Regularly Conducted Activity. A record (which includes a
memorandum, report, or data compilation in any form) of an act, event or condition if:
(A) the record was made at or near the time by—or from information
transmitted by—someone with knowledge;
(B) the record was kept in the course of a regularly conducted activity
of a ‘‘business’’, which term includes business, institution, association,
profession, occupation, and calling of every kind, whether or not conducted for profit;
(C) making the record was a regular practice of that activity;
(D) all these conditions are shown by the testimony of the custodian or
another qualified witness, or by a certification that complies with Rule
902(11) or (12) or with a statute permitting certification; and
(E) the opponent does not show that the source of information or other
circumstances indicate a lack of trustworthiness.
Comment
Pa.R.E. 803(6) differs from F.R.E. 803(6). One difference is that Pa.R.E. 803(6) defines the term
‘‘record.’’ In the Federal Rules this definition appears at F.R.E. 101(b). Another difference is that
Pa.R.E. 803(6) applies to records of an act, event or condition, but does not include opinions and
diagnoses. This is consistent with prior Pennsylvania case law. See Williams v. McClain, 520 A.2d
1374 (Pa. 1987); Commonwealth v. DiGiacomo, 345 A.2d 605 (Pa. 1975). A third difference is that
Pa.R.E. 803(6) allows the court to exclude business records that would otherwise qualify for exception to the hearsay rule if the ‘‘source of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.’’ The Federal Rule allows the court to do so only if either ‘‘the source of information or the
method or circumstances of preparation indicate a lack of trustworthiness.’’
If offered against a defendant in a criminal case, an entry in a record may be excluded if its admission would violate the defendant’s constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him or her,
see Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U.S. 305 (2009); however, forensic laboratory reports may
be admissible in lieu of testimony by the person who performed the analysis or examination that is
the subject of the report, see Pa.R.Crim.P. 574.

Rule 803(7). Absence of a Record of a Regularly Conducted Activity (Not
Adopted).
(7) Absence of a Record of a Regularly Conducted Activity (Not Adopted)
Comment
Pennsylvania has not adopted F.R.E. 803(7) which provides:
Evidence that a matter is not included in a record described in [F.R.E. 803(6)] if:
(A) the evidence is admitted to prove that the matter did not occur or exist;
(B) a record was regularly kept for a matter of that kind; and
(C) the opponent does not show that the possible source of the information or other circumstances indicate a lack of trustworthiness.
Principles of logic and internal consistency have led Pennsylvania to reject this rule. The absence
of an entry in a record is not hearsay, as defined in Pa.R.E. 801(c). Hence, it appears irrational to
except it to the hearsay rule.
On analysis, absence of an entry in a business record is circumstantial evidence—it tends to prove
something by implication, not assertion. Its admissibility is governed by principles of relevance, not
hearsay. See Pa.R.E. 401, et seq.
Pennsylvania law is in accord with the object of F.R.E. 803(7), i.e., to allow evidence of the
absence of a record of an act, event, or condition to be introduced to prove the nonoccurrence or nonexistence thereof, if the matter was one which would ordinarily be recorded. See Klein v. F.W. Woolworth Co., 163 A. 532 (Pa. 1932) (absence of person’s name in personnel records admissible to prove
that he was not an employee). See also Stack v. Wapner, 368 A.2d 292 (Pa. Super. 1976).

(8) Public Records. A record of a public office if:

public duty; and
(C) the opponent does not show that the source of the information or
other circumstances indicate a lack of trustworthiness.

Pa.R.E. 803(8) differs from F.R.E. 803(8) insofar as it reflects the hearsay exception for public

(384742) No. 507 Feb. 17 Copyright  2017 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
Comment
Pennsylvania has not adopted F.R.E. 803(9). Records of vital statistics are also records of a regularly conducted activity and may be excepted to the hearsay rule by Pa.R.E. 803(6). Records of vital
statistics are public records and they may be excepted to the hearsay rule by 42 Pa.C.S. § 6104.
The Vital Statistics Law of 1953, 35 P.S. § 450.101 et seq., provides for registration of births,
deaths, fetal deaths, and marriages, with the State Department of Health. The records of the Department, and duly certified copies thereof, are excepted to the hearsay rule by 35 P.S. § 450.810 which
provides:
Any record or duly certified copy of a record or part thereof which is (1) filed with the department
in accordance with the provisions of this act and the regulations of the Advisory Health Board and
which (2) is not a ‘‘delayed’’ record filed under section seven hundred two of this act or a record
‘‘corrected’’ under section seven hundred three of this act shall constitute prima facie evidence of its
contents, except that in any proceeding in which paternity is controverted and which affects the interests of an alleged father or his successors in interest no record or part thereof shall constitute prima
facie evidence of paternity unless the alleged father is the husband of the mother of the child.

Rule 803(10). Non-Existence of a Public Record.
(10) Non-Existence of a Public Record. Testimony—or a certification—
that a diligent search failed to disclose a public record if:
(A) the testimony or certification is admitted to prove that
(i) the record does not exist; or
(ii) a matter did not occur or exist, if a public office regularly kept a
record for a matter of that kind.
(B) in a criminal case:
(i) the attorney for the Commonwealth who intends to offer a certification files and serves written notice of that intent upon the defendant’s
attorney or, if unrepresented, the defendant, at least 20 days before trial;
and
(ii) defendant’s attorney or, if unrepresented, the defendant, does not
file and serve a written demand for testimony in lieu of the certification
within 10 days of service of the notice.
Comment
Pa.R.E. 803(10)(A) differs from F.R.E. 803(10)(A) insofar as it does not include ‘‘statements.’’
This rule is consistent with Pennsylvania law. See 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 5328(d) and 6103(b). See also
Pa.R.E. 902(13) (authentication of certificate).
Pa.R.E. 803(10)(B) differs from F.R.E. 803(10)(B) insofar as it is made consistent with aspects of
Pa.R.Crim.P. 574. Like the federal rule, this rule is intended to provide a mechanism for a defendant
to exercise the constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him or her. See Melendez-Diaz v.
Massachusetts, 557 U.S. 305 (2009). Nothing in this evidentiary rule is intended to supersede procedural requirements within the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure, see, e.g., Pa.R.Crim.P. 576

(22) Judgment of a Previous Conviction (Not Adopted)
Comment
Pennsylvania has not adopted F.R.E. 803(22).
With respect to facts essential to sustain a judgment of criminal conviction, there are four basic
approaches that a court can take:
1. The judgment of conviction is conclusive, i.e., estops the party convicted from contesting any
fact essential to sustain the conviction.
2. The judgment of conviction is admissible as evidence of any fact essential to sustain the conviction, only if offered against the party convicted.
HEARSAY 225 Rule 803(20)
8-13
(365911) No. 461 Apr. 13
3. The judgment of conviction is admissible as evidence of any fact essential to sustain the conviction when offered against any party (this is the federal rule for felonies, except that the Government cannot offer someone else’s conviction against the defendant in a criminal case, other than for
purposes of impeachment).
4. The judgment of conviction is neither conclusive nor admissible as evidence to prove a fact
essential to sustain the conviction (common law rule).
For felonies and other major crimes, Pennsylvania takes approach number one. In subsequent litigation, the convicted party is estopped from denying or contesting any fact essential to sustain the
conviction. Once a party is estopped from contesting a fact, no evidence need be introduced by an
adverse party to prove it. See Hurtt v. Stirone, 416 Pa. 493, 206 A.2d 624 (1965); In re Estate of Bartolovich, 420 Pa. Super. 419, 616 A.2d 1043 (1992) (judgment of conviction conclusive under Slayer’s Act, 20 Pa.C.S. §§ 8801—8815).
For minor offenses, Pennsylvania takes approach number four; it applies the common law rule.
Evidence of a conviction is inadmissible to prove a fact necessary to sustain the conviction. See
Loughner v. Schmelzer, 421 Pa. 283, 218 A.2d 768 (1966).
A plea of guilty to a crime is excepted to the hearsay rule as an admission of all facts essential to
sustain a conviction, but only when offered against the pleader by a party-opponent. See Pa.R.E.
803(25); see also Pa.R.E. 410. A plea of guilty may also qualify as an exception to the hearsay rule
as a statement against interest, if the declarant is unavailable to testify at trial. See Pa.R.E. 804(b)(3).

Rule 803(25). An Opposing Party’s Statement.
(25) An Opposing Party’s Statement. The statement is offered against an
opposing party and:
(A) was made by the party in an individual or representative capacity;
(B) is one the party manifested that it adopted or believed to be true;
(C) was made by a person whom the party authorized to make a statement on the subject;
(D) was made by the party’s agent or employee on a matter within the
scope of that relationship and while it existed; or
(E) was made by the party’s coconspirator during and in furtherance
of the conspiracy.
The statement may be considered but does not by itself establish the declarant’s
authority under (C); the existence or scope of the relationship under (D); or the
existence of the conspiracy or participation in it under (E).
Comment
Pa.R.E. 803(25) differs from F.R.E. 801(d)(2), in that the word ‘‘must’’ in the last paragraph has
been replaced with the word ‘‘may.’’
The Federal Rules treat these statements as ‘‘not hearsay’’ and places them in F.R.E 801(d)(2). The
traditional view was that these statements were hearsay, but admissible as exceptions to the hearsay
rule. The Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence follow the traditional view and place these statements in
Pa.R.E. 803(25), as exceptions to the hearsay rule—regardless of the availability of the declarant. This
differing placement is not intended to have substantive effect.
The statements in this exception were traditionally, and in prior versions of both the Federal Rules
of Evidence and the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence, called admissions, although in many cases the
statements were not admissions as that term is employed in common usage. The new phrase used in
the federal rules—an opposing party’s statement—more accurately describes these statements and is
adopted here.
The personal knowledge rule (Pa.R.E. 602) is not applicable to an opposing party’s statement. See
Salvitti v. Throppe, 343 Pa. 642, 23 A.2d 445 (1942).

Rule 803.1. Exceptions to the Rule Against Hearsay—Testimony of
Declarant Necessary.
The following statements are not excluded by the rule against hearsay if the
declarant testifies and is subject to cross-examination about the prior statement:
Comment
A witness must be subject to cross-examination regarding the prior statement. See Commonwealth
v. Romero, 722 A.2d 1014, 1017-1018 (Pa. 1999) (witness was not available for cross-examination
when witness refused to answer questions about prior statement).
(1) Prior Inconsistent Statement of Declarant-Witness. A prior statement
by a declarant-witness that is inconsistent with the declarant-witness’s testimony and:
(A) was given under oath subject to the penalty of perjury at a trial,
hearing, or other proceeding, or in a deposition;
(B) is a writing signed and adopted by the declarant; or
HEARSAY 225 Rule 803(25)
8-15
(407867) No. 568 Mar. 22
(C) is a verbatim contemporaneous electronic recording of an oral
statement.
Comment
The Federal Rules treat statements corresponding to Pa.R.E. 803.1(1) and (2) as ‘‘not hearsay’’ and
places them in F.R.E. 801(d)(1)(A) and (C). Pennsylvania follows the traditional approach that treats
these statements as exceptions to the hearsay rule if the declarant testifies at the trial.
Pa.R.E. 803.1(1) is consistent with prior Pennsylvania case law. See Commonwealth v. Brady, 507
A.2d 66 (Pa. 1986) (seminal case that overruled close to two centuries of decisional law in Pennsylvania and held that the recorded statement of a witness to a murder, inconsistent with her testimony
at trial, was properly admitted as substantive evidence, excepted to the hearsay rule); Commonwealth
v. Lively, 610 A.2d 7 (Pa. 1992). In Commonwealth v. Wilson, 707 A.2d 1114 (Pa. 1998), the Supreme
Court held that to be admissible under this rule an oral statement must be a verbatim contemporaneous recording in electronic, audiotaped, or videotaped form.
An inconsistent statement of a witness that does not qualify as an exception to the hearsay rule may
still be introduced to impeach the credibility of the witness. See Pa.R.E. 613.
(2) Prior Statement of Identification by Declarant-Witness. A prior statement by a declarant-witness identifying a person or thing, made after perceiving the person or thing, provided that the declarant-witness testifies to the
making of the prior statement.
Comment
Pennsylvania treats a statement meeting the requirements of Pa.R.E. 803.1(2) as an exception to
the hearsay rule. F.R.E. 801(d)(1)(C) provides that such a statement is not hearsay. This differing
organization is consistent with Pennsylvania law.
Pa.R.E. 803.1(2) differs from F.R.E. 801(d)(1)(C) in several respects. It requires the witness to testify to making the identification. This is consistent with Pennsylvania law. See Commonwealth v. Ly,
599 A.2d 613 (Pa. 1991). The Pennsylvania rule includes identification of a thing, in addition to a
person.
(3) Recorded Recollection of Declarant-Witness. A memorandum or record
made or adopted by a declarant-witness that:
(A) is on a matter the declarant-witness once knew about but now cannot recall well enough to testify fully and accurately;
(B) was made or adopted by the declarant-witness when the matter
was fresh in his or her memory; and
(C) the declarant-witness testifies accurately reflects his or her knowledge at the time when made.
If admitted, the memorandum or record may be read into evidence and received
as an exhibit, but may be shown to the jury only in exceptional circumstances or
when offered by an adverse party.
Comment
Pa.R.E. 803.1(3) is similar to F.R.E. 803(5), but differs in the following ways:
1. Pennsylvania treats a statement meeting the requirements of Pa.R.E. 803.1(3) as an exception to
the hearsay rule in which the testimony of the declarant is necessary. F.R.E. 803(5) treats this as an
exception regardless of the availability of the declarant. This differing organization is consistent with
Pennsylvania law.
2. Pa.R.E. 803.1(3)(C) makes clear that, to qualify a recorded recollection as an exception to the
hearsay rule, the witness must testify that the memorandum or record correctly reflects the knowledge
that the witness once had. In other words, the witness must vouch for the reliability of the record. The
Federal Rule is ambiguous on this point and the applicable federal cases are conflicting.
225 Rule 803.1 RULES OF EVIDENCE
8-16
(407868) No. 568 Mar. 22 Copyright  2022 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
3. Pa.R.E. 803.1(3) allows the memorandum or record to be received as an exhibit, and grants the
trial judge discretion to show it to the jury in exceptional circumstances, even when not offered by an
adverse party.
Pa.R.E. 803.1(3) is consistent with Pennsylvania law. See Commonwealth v. Cargo, 444 A.2d 639
(Pa. 1982).
(4) Prior Statement by a Declarant-Witness Who Claims an Inability to
Remember the Subject Matter of the Statement. A prior statement by a
declarant-witness who testifies to an inability to remember the subject matter
of the statement, unless the court finds the claimed inability to remember to be
credible, and the statement:
(A) was given under oath subject to the penalty of perjury at a trial,
hearing, or other proceeding, or in a deposition;
(B) is a writing signed and adopted by the declarant; or
(C) is a verbatim contemporaneous electronic recording of an oral
statement.
Comment
Pa.R.E. 803.1(4) has no counterpart in the Federal Rules of Evidence. The purpose of this hearsay
exception is to protect against the ‘‘turncoat witness’’ who once provided a statement, but now seeks
to deprive the use of this evidence at trial. It is intended to permit the admission of a prior statement
given under demonstrably reliable and trustworthy circumstances, see, e.g., Commonwealth v.
Hanible, 30 A.3d 426, 445 n. 15 (Pa. 2011), when the declarant-witness feigns memory loss about the
subject matter of the statement.
A prior statement made by a declarant-witness having credible memory loss about the subject matter of the statement, but able to testify that the statement accurately reflects his or her knowledge at
the time it was made, may be admissible under Pa.R.E. 803.1(3). Otherwise, when a declarant-witness
has a credible memory loss about the subject matter of the statement, see Pa.R.E. 804(a)(3).

Rule 804. Exceptions to the Rule Against Hearsay—When the Declarant
is Unavailable as a Witness.
(a) Criteria for Being Unavailable. A declarant is considered to be unavailable as a witness if the declarant:
(1) is exempted from testifying about the subject matter of the declarant’s
statement because the court rules that a privilege applies;
(2) refuses to testify about the subject matter despite a court order to do so;
(3) testifies to not remembering the subject matter, except as provided in
Rule 803.1(4);
(4) cannot be present or testify at the trial or hearing because of death or
a then-existing infirmity, physical illness, or mental illness; or
(5) is absent from the trial or hearing and the statement’s proponent has not
been able, by process or other reasonable means, to procure:
(A) the declarant’s attendance, in the case of a hearsay exception under
Rule 804(b)(1) or (6); or
(B) the declarant’s attendance or testimony, in the case of a hearsay
exception under Rule 804(b)(2), (3), or (4).
But this paragraph (a) does not apply if the statement’s proponent procured or
wrongfully caused the declarant’s unavailability as a witness in order to prevent
the declarant from attending or testifying.
Comment
Pa.R.E. 804(a)(3) differs from F.R.E. 804(a)(3) in that it excepts from this rule instances where a
declarant-witness’s claim of an inability to remember the subject matter of a prior statement is not
credible, provided the statement meets the requirements found in Pa.R.E. 803.1(4). This rule is otherwise identical to F.R.E. 804(a). A declarant-witness with credible memory loss about the subject
matter of a prior statement may be subject to this rule.

Rule 804(b). The Exceptions.
(b) The Exceptions. The following are not excluded by the rule against hearsay if the declarant is unavailable as a witness:
(1) Former Testimony. Testimony that:
(A) was given as a witness at a trial, hearing, or lawful deposition,
whether given during the current proceeding or a different one; and
(B) is now offered against a party who had—or, in a civil case, whose
predecessor in interest had—an opportunity and similar motive to develop
it by direct, cross-, or redirect examination.

Comment
Pa.R.E. 804(b)(1) is identical to F.R.E. 804(b)(1).
In criminal cases the Supreme Court has held that former testimony is admissible against the
defendant only if the defendant had a ‘‘full and fair’’ opportunity to examine the witness. See Commonwealth v. Bazemore, 614 A.2d 684 (Pa. 1992).
Depositions
Depositions are the most common form of former testimony that is introduced at a modern trial.
Their use is provided for not only by Pa.R.E. 804(b)(1), but also by statute and rules of procedure
promulgated by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.
The Judicial Code provides for the use of depositions in criminal cases. 42 Pa.C.S. § 5919 provides:
Depositions in criminal matters. The testimony of witnesses taken in accordance with section
5325 (relating to when and how a deposition may be taken outside this Commonwealth) may be
read in evidence upon the trial of any criminal matter unless it shall appear at the trial that the
witness whose deposition has been taken is in attendance, or has been or can be served with a
subpoena to testify, or his attendance otherwise procured, in which case the deposition shall not
be admissible.
42 Pa.C.S. § 5325 sets forth the procedure for taking depositions, by either prosecution or defendant, outside Pennsylvania.
In civil cases, the introduction of depositions, or parts thereof, at trial is provided for by Pa.R.C.P.
No. 4020(a)(3) and (5).
A video deposition of a medical witness, or any expert witness, other than a party to the case, may
be introduced in evidence at trial, regardless of the witness’s availability, pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. No.
4017.1(g).
42 Pa.C.S. § 5936 provides that the testimony of a licensed physician taken by deposition in
accordance with the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure is admissible in a civil case. There is no
requirement that the physician testify as an expert witness.
(2) Statement Under Belief of Imminent Death. A statement that the
declarant, while believing the declarant’s death to be imminent, made about its
cause or circumstances.
Comment
Pa.R.E. 804(b)(2) differs from F.R.E. 804(b)(2) in that the Federal Rule is applicable in criminal
cases only if the defendant is charged with homicide. The Pennsylvania Rule is applicable in all civil
and criminal cases, subject to the defendant’s right to confrontation in criminal cases.
In Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004), the Supreme Court interpreted the Confrontation
Cause in the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution to prohibit the introduction of ‘‘testimonial’’ hearsay from an unavailable witness against a defendant in a criminal case unless the
defendant had an opportunity to confront and cross-examine the declarant, regardless of its exception
from the hearsay rule. However, in footnote 6, the Supreme Court said that there may be an exception, sui generis, for those dying declarations that are testimonial.
(3) Statement Against Interest. A statement that:
(A) a reasonable person in the declarant’s position would have made
only if the person believed it to be true because, when made, it was so
contrary to the declarant’s proprietary or pecuniary interest or had so great
a tendency to invalidate the declarant’s claim against someone else or to
expose the declarant to civil or criminal liability; and
(B) is supported by corroborating circumstances that clearly indicate
its trustworthiness, if it is offered in a criminal case as one that tends to
expose the declarant to criminal liability.

Comment
This rule is identical to F.R.E. 804(b)(3).
(4) Statement of Personal or Family History. A statement made before the
controversy arose about:
(A) the declarant’s own birth, adoption, legitimacy, ancestry, marriage,
divorce, relationship by blood, adoption or marriage, or similar facts of
personal or family history, even though the declarant had no way of acquiring personal knowledge about that fact; or
(B) another person concerning any of these facts, as well as death, if
the declarant was related to the person by blood, adoption, or marriage or
was so intimately associated with the person’s family that the declarant’s
information is likely to be accurate.
Comment
Pa.R.E. 804(b)(4) differs from F.R.E. 804(b)(4) by requiring that the statement be made before the
controversy arose. See In re McClain’s Estate, 392 A.2d 1371 (Pa. 1978). This requirement is not
imposed by the Federal Rule.
(5) Other exceptions (Not Adopted)
Comment
Pennsylvania has not adopted F.R.E. 804(b)(5) (now F.R.E. 807).
(6) Statement Offered Against a Party That Wrongfully Caused the

caused—or acquiesced in wrongfully causing—the declarant’s unavailability as
a witness, and did so intending that result.

Rule 806. Attacking and Supporting the Declarant’s Credibility.
When a hearsay statement has been admitted in evidence, the declarant’s credibility may be attacked, and then supported, by any evidence that would be
admissible for those purposes if the declarant had testified as a witness. The court
may admit evidence of the declarant’s inconsistent statement or conduct, regardless of when it occurred or whether the declarant had an opportunity to explain
or deny it. If the party against whom the statement was admitted calls the
declarant as a witness, the party may examine the declarant on the statement as
if on cross-examination.
HEARSAY 225 Rule 804(b)(3)
8-21
(407873) No. 568 Mar. 22
Comment
Pa.R.E. 806 differs from F.R.E. 806 in that Pa.R.E. 806 makes no reference to Rule 801(d)(2). The
subject matter of F.R.E. 801(d)(2) (an opposing party’s statement) is covered by Pa.R.E. 803(25). The
change is not substantive. Pa.R.E. 806 is consistent with Pennsylvania law. See Commonwealth v.
Davis, 363 Pa. Super. 562, 526 A.2d 1205 (1987).
The requirement that a witness be given an opportunity to explain or deny the making of an inconsistent statement provided by Pa.R.E. 613(b)(2) is not applicable when the prior inconsistent statement
is offered to impeach a statement admitted under an exception to the hearsay rule. In most cases, the

Rule 901. Authenticating or Identifying Evidence.
(a) In General. Unless stipulated, to satisfy the requirement of authenticating
or identifying an item of evidence, the proponent must produce evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what the proponent claims it is.
(b) Examples. The following are examples only—not a complete list—of evidence that satisfies the requirement:
(1) Testimony of a Witness with Knowledge. Testimony that an item is what
it is claimed to be.
(2) Nonexpert Opinion about Handwriting. A nonexpert’s opinion that
handwriting is genuine, based on a familiarity with it that was not acquired for
the current litigation.
(3) Comparison by an Expert Witness or the Trier of Fact. A comparison
with an authenticated specimen by an expert witness or the trier of fact.
(4) Distinctive Characteristics and the Like. The appearance, contents, substance, internal patterns, or other distinctive characteristics of the item, taken
together with all the circumstances.
(5) Opinion About a Voice. An opinion identifying a person’s voice—
whether heard firsthand or through mechanical or electronic transmission or
recording—based on hearing the voice at any time under circumstances that
connect it with the alleged speaker.
(6) Evidence About a Telephone Conversation. For a telephone conversation, evidence that a call was made to the number assigned at the time to:
(A) a particular person, if circumstances, including self-identification,
show that the person answering was the one called; or
(B) a particular business, if the call was made to a business and the call
related to business reasonably transacted over the telephone.
(7) Evidence About Public Records. Evidence that:
(A) a document was recorded or filed in a public office as authorized by
law; or
(B) a purported public record or statement is from the office where
items of this kind are kept.
(8) Evidence About Ancient Documents or Data Compilations. For a document or data compilation, evidence that it:
(A) is in a condition that creates no suspicion about its authenticity;
(B) was in a place where, if authentic, it would likely be; and
(C) is at least 30 years old when offered.

account at the relevant time when corroborated by circumstances indicating authorship.
Comment
Pa.R.E. 901(a) is substantively identical to F.R.E. 901(a) and consistent with Pennsylvania law. The
authentication or identification requirement may be expressed as follows: When a party offers evidence contending either expressly or impliedly that the evidence is connected with a person, place,
thing, or event, the party must provide evidence sufficient to support a finding of the contended connection. See Commonwealth v. Hudson, 414 A.2d 1381 (Pa. 1980); Commonwealth v. Pollock, 606
A.2d 500 (Pa. Super. 1992). The proponent may be relieved of this burden when all parties have
stipulated the authenticity or identification of the evidence. See, e.g., Pa.R.C.P. No. 212.3(a)(3) (PreTrial Conference); Pa.R.C.P. No. 4014 (Request for Admission); Pa.R.Crim.P. 570(A)(2) & (3) (PreTrial Conference).
In some cases, real evidence may not be relevant unless its condition at the time of trial is similar
to its condition at the time of the incident in question. In such cases, the party offering the evidence
must also introduce evidence sufficient to support a finding that the condition is similar. Pennsylvania
law treats this requirement as an aspect of authentication. See Commonwealth v. Hudson, 414 A.2d
1381 (Pa. 1980).
Demonstrative evidence such as photographs, motion pictures, diagrams and models must be
authenticated by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the demonstrative evidence fairly and
accurately represents that which it purports to depict. See Nyce v. Muffley, 119 A.2d 530 (Pa. 1956).
Pa.R.E. 901(b) is identical to F.R.E. 901(b).
Pa.R.E. 901(b)(1) is identical to F.R.E. 901(b)(1). It is consistent with Pennsylvania law in that the
testimony of a witness with personal knowledge may be sufficient to authenticate or identify the evidence. See Commonwealth v. Hudson, 414 A.2d 1381 (Pa. 1980).
Pa.R.E. 901(b)(2) is identical to F.R.E. 901(b)(2). It is consistent with 42 Pa.C.S. § 6111, which
also deals with the admissibility of handwriting.
Pa.R.E. 901(b)(3) is identical to F.R.E. 901(b)(3). It is consistent with Pennsylvania law. When
there is a question as to the authenticity of an exhibit, the trier of fact will have to resolve the issue.
This may be done by comparing the exhibit to authenticated specimens. See Commonwealth v. Gipe,
84 A.2d 366 (Pa. Super. 1951) (comparison of typewritten document with authenticated specimen).
Under this rule, the court must decide whether the specimen used for comparison to the exhibit is
authentic. If the court determines that there is sufficient evidence to support a finding that the specimen is authentic, the trier of fact is then permitted to compare the exhibit to the authenticated specimen. Under Pennsylvania law, lay or expert testimony is admissible to assist the jury in resolving the
question. See, e.g., 42 Pa.C.S. § 6111.

(402202) No. 551 Oct. 20 Copyright  2020 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
Pa.R.E. 901(b)(4) is identical to F.R.E. 901(b)(4). Pennsylvania law has permitted evidence to be
authenticated by circumstantial evidence similar to that discussed in this illustration. The evidence
may take a variety of forms including: evidence establishing chain of custody, see Commonwealth v.
Melendez, 474 A.2d 617 (Pa. Super. 1984); evidence that a letter is in reply to an earlier communication, see Roe v. Dwelling House Ins. Co. of Boston, 23 A. 718 (Pa. 1892); testimony that an item
of evidence was found in a place connected to a party, see Commonwealth v. Bassi, 130 A. 311 (Pa.
1925); a phone call authenticated by evidence of party’s conduct after the call, see Commonwealth v.
Gold, 186 A. 208 (Pa. Super. 1936); and the identity of a speaker established by the content and circumstances of a conversation, see Bonavitacola v. Cluver, 619 A.2d 1363 (Pa. Super. 1993).
Pa.R.E. 901(b)(5) is identical to F.R.E. 901(b)(5). Pennsylvania law has permitted the identification of a voice to be made by a person familiar with the alleged speaker’s voice. See Commonwealth
v. Carpenter, 372 A.2d 806 (Pa. 1977).
Pa.R.E. 901(b)(6) is identical to F.R.E. 901(b)(6). This paragraph appears to be consistent with
Pennsylvania law. See Smithers v. Light, 157 A. 489 (Pa. 1931); Wahl v. State Workmen’s Ins. Fund,
11 A.2d 496 (Pa. Super. 1940).
Pa.R.E. 901(b)(7) is identical to F.R.E. 901(b)(7). This paragraph illustrates that public records and
reports may be authenticated in the same manner as other writings. In addition, public records and
reports may be self-authenticating as provided in Pa.R.E. 902. Public records and reports may also be
authenticated as otherwise provided by statute. See Pa.R.E. 901(b)(10) and its Comment.
Pa.R.E. 901(b)(8) differs from F.R.E. 901(b)(8), in that the Pennsylvania Rule requires thirty years,
while the Federal Rule requires twenty years. This change makes the rule consistent with Pennsylvania law. See Commonwealth ex rel. Ferguson v. Ball, 121 A. 191 (Pa. 1923).
Pa.R.E. 901(b)(9) is identical to F.R.E. 901(b)(9). There is very little authority in Pennsylvania discussing authentication of evidence as provided in this illustration. The paragraph is consistent with
the authority that exists. For example, in Commonwealth v. Visconto, 448 A.2d 41 (Pa. Super. 1982),
a computer print-out was held to be admissible. In Appeal of Chartiers Valley School District, 447
A.2d 317 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1982), computer studies were not admitted as business records, in part,
because it was not established that the mode of preparing the evidence was reliable. The court used
a similar approach in Commonwealth v. Westwood, 188 A. 304 (Pa. 1936) (test for gun powder residue) and in other cases to admit various kinds of scientific evidence. See Commonwealth v. Middleton, 550 A.2d 561 (Pa. Super. 1988) (electrophoretic analysis of dried blood); Commonwealth v. Rodgers, 605 A.2d 1228 (Pa. Super. 1992) (results of DNA/RFLP testing).
Pa.R.E. 901(b)(10) differs from F.R.E. 901(b)(10) to eliminate the reference to Federal law and to
make the paragraph conform to Pennsylvania law.
Pa.R.E. 901(b)(11) has no counterpart in the Federal Rules of Evidence. ‘‘Digital evidence,’’ as
used in this rule, is intended to include a communication, statement, or image existing in an electronic
medium. This includes emails, text messages, social media postings, and images. The rule illustrates
the manner in which digital evidence may be attributed to the author.
The proponent of digital evidence is not required to prove that no one else could be the author.
Rather, the proponent must produce sufficient evidence to support a finding that a particular person
or entity was the author. See Pa.R.E. 901(a).
Direct evidence under Pa.R.E. 901(b)(11)(A) may also include an admission by a party-opponent.
Circumstantial evidence of identifying content under Pa.R.E. 901(b)(11)(B)(i) may include selfidentification or other distinctive characteristics, including a display of knowledge only possessed by
the author. Circumstantial evidence of content may be sufficient to connect the digital evidence to its
author.
Circumstantial evidence of ownership, possession, control, or access to a device or account alone
is insufficient for authentication of authorship of digital evidence under Pa.R.E. 901(b)(11)(B)(ii). See,
AUTHENTICATION AND IDENTIFICATION 225 Rule 901
9-3
(402203) No. 551 Oct. 20
e.g., Commonwealth v. Mangel, 181 A.3d 1154, 1163 (Pa. Super. 2018) (social media account bearing
defendant’s name, hometown, and high school was insufficient to authenticate the online and mobile
device chat messages as having been authored by defendant). However, this evidence is probative in
combination with other evidence of the author’s identity.
Expert testimony may also be used for authentication purposes. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Manivannan, 186 A.3d 472 (Pa. Super. 2018).
There are a number of statutes that provide for authentication or identification of various types of
evidence. See, e.g., 42 Pa.C.S. § 6103 (official records within the Commonwealth); 42 Pa.C.S.
§ 5328 (domestic records outside the Commonwealth and foreign records); 35 P.S. § 450.810 (vital
statistics); 42 Pa.C.S. § 6106 (documents filed in a public office); 42 Pa.C.S. § 6110 (certain registers of marriages, births and burials records); 75 Pa.C.S. § 1547(c) (chemical tests for alcohol and
controlled substances); 75 Pa.C.S. § 3368 (speed timing devices); 75 Pa.C.S. § 1106(c) (certificates
of title); 42 Pa.C.S. § 6151 (certified copies of medical records); 23 Pa.C.S. § 5104 (blood tests to
determine paternity); 23 Pa.C.S. § 4343 (genetic tests to determine paternity).

Rule 902. Evidence That is Self-Authenticating.
The following items of evidence are self-authenticating; they require no extrinsic evidence of authenticity in order to be admitted:
(1) Domestic Public Documents That Are Sealed and Signed. A document
that bears:
(A) a seal purporting to be that of the United States; any state, district,
commonwealth, territory, or insular possession of the United States; the
former Panama Canal Zone; the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands; a
political subdivision of any of these entities; or a department, agency, or
officer of any entity named above; and
(B) a signature purporting to be an execution or attestation.
(2) Domestic Public Documents That Are Not Sealed But Are Signed and
Certified. A document that bears no seal if:
225 Rule 902 RULES OF EVIDENCE
9-4
(402204) No. 551 Oct. 20 Copyright  2020 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
(A) it bears the signature of an officer or employee of an entity named
in Rule 902(1)(A); and
(B) another public officer who has a seal and official duties within that
same entity certifies under seal—or its equivalent—that the signer has the
official capacity and that the signature is genuine.
(3) Foreign Public Documents. A document that purports to be signed or
attested by a person who is authorized by a foreign country’s law to do so. The
document must be accompanied by a final certification that certifies the genuineness of the signature and official position of the signer or attester—or of any
foreign official whose certificate of genuineness relates to the signature or
attestation or is in a chain of certificates of genuineness relating to the signature or attestation. The certification may be made by a secretary of a United
States embassy or legation; by a consul general, vice consul, or consular agent
of the United States; or by a diplomatic or consular official of the foreign
country assigned or accredited to the United States. If all parties have been
given a reasonable opportunity to investigate the document’s authenticity and
accuracy, the court may for good cause, either:
(A) order that it be treated as presumptively authentic without final
certification; or
(B) allow it to be evidenced by an attested summary with or without
final certification.
(4) Certified Copies of Public Records. A copy of an official record—or a
copy of a document that was recorded or filed in a public office as authorized
by law—if the copy is certified as correct by:
(A) the custodian or another person authorized to make the certification; or
(B) a certificate that complies with Rule 902(1), (2), or (3), a statute,
or a rule prescribed by the Supreme Court.

A certificate required by paragraph (4)(B) may include a handwritten signature,
a copy of a handwritten signature, a computer generated signature, or a signature
created, transmitted, received, or stored by electronic means, by the signer or by
someone with the signer’s authorization. A seal may, but need not, be raised.
(5) Official Publications. A book, pamphlet, or other publication purporting to be issued by a public authority.
(6) Newspapers and Periodicals. Material purporting to be a newspaper or
periodical.
(7) Trade Inscriptions and the Like. An inscription, sign, tag, or label purporting to have been affixed in the course of business and indicating origin,
ownership, or control.
(8) Acknowledged Documents. A document accompanied by a certificate of
acknowledgment that is lawfully executed by a notary public or another officer
who is authorized to take acknowledgments.
(9) Commercial Paper and Related Documents. Commercial paper, a signature on it, and related documents, to the extent allowed by general commercial law.
(10) Presumptions Authorized by Statute. A signature, document, or anything else that a statute declares to be presumptively or prima facie genuine or
authentic.
(11) Certified Domestic Records of a Regularly Conducted Activity. The
original or a copy of a domestic record that meets the requirements of Rule
803(6)(A)—(C), as shown by a certification of the custodian or another qualified person that complies with Pa.R.C.P. No. 76. Before the trial or hearing, the
proponent must give an adverse party reasonable written notice of the intent to
offer the record—and must make the record and certification available for
inspection—so that the party has a fair opportunity to challenge them.
(12) Certified Foreign Records of a Regularly Conducted Activity. The
original or a copy of a foreign record that meets the requirements of Rule
902(11), modified as follows: the certification rather than complying with a
statute or Supreme Court rule, must be signed in a manner that, if falsely made,
would subject the maker to a criminal penalty in the country where the certification is signed. The proponent must also meet the notice requirements of Rule
902(11).
(13) Certified Records Generated by an Electronic Process or System. A
record generated by an electronic process or system that produces an accurate
result, as shown by a certification of a qualified person that complies with the
certification requirements of Rule 902(11) or (12). The proponent must also
meet the notice requirements of Rule 902(11).
(14) Certified Data Copied from an Electronic Device, Storage Medium, or
File. Data copied from an electronic device, storage medium, or file, if authenticated by a process of digital identification, as shown by a certification of a

902(11).
(15) Certificate of Non-Existence of a Public Record. A certificate that a
document was not recorded or filed in a public office as authorized by law if
certified by the custodian or another person authorized to make the certificate.
Comment
This rule permits some evidence to be authenticated without extrinsic evidence of authentication or
identification. In other words, the requirement that a proponent must present authentication or identification evidence as a condition precedent to admissibility, as provided by Pa.R.E. 901(a), is inapplicable to the evidence discussed in Pa.R.E. 902. The rationale for the rule is that, for the types of evidence covered by Pa.R.E. 902, the risk of forgery or deception is so small, and the likelihood of
discovery of forgery or deception is so great, that the cost of presenting extrinsic evidence and the
waste of court time is not justified. Of course, this rule does not preclude the opposing party from
contesting the authenticity of the evidence. In that situation, authenticity is to be resolved by the
finder of fact.
Pa.R.E. 902(1), (2), (3), and (4) deal with self-authentication of various kinds of public documents
and records. They are identical to F.R.E. 902(1), (2), (3), and (4), except that Pa.R.E. 901(4) eliminates the reference to Federal law and does not require the certificate to include a pen-and-ink signature or raised seal for the self-authentication of public documents. These paragraphs are consistent
with Pennsylvania statutory law. See, e.g. 42 Pa.C.S. § 6103 (official records within the Commonwealth); 42 Pa.C.S. § 5328 (domestic records outside the Commonwealth and foreign records); 35
P.S. § 450.810 (vital statistics); 42 Pa.C.S. § 6106 (documents filed in a public office).
The admission of a self-authenticating record of a prior conviction also requires sufficient evidence, either direct or circumstantial, to prove that the subject of the record is the same person for
whom the record is offered in a proceeding. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Boyd, 344 A.2d 864 (Pa.
1975).
Pa.R.E. 902(4) differs from F.R.E. 902(4) insofar as the rule does not require the certificate to
include a pen-and-ink signature or raised seal for the self-authentication of public documents.
Pa.R.E. 902(5) is identical to F.R.E. 902(5). There is no corresponding statutory provision in Pennsylvania; however, 45 Pa.C.S. § 506 (judicial notice of the contents of the Pennsylvania Code and
the Pennsylvania Bulletin) is similar to Pa.R.E. 902(5).
Pa.R.E. 902(6) differs from F.R.E. 902(6) insofar as it does not contain ‘‘printed’’ in reference to
newspapers or periodicals. Cf. F.R.E. 101(b)(6) (‘‘[A] reference to any kind of written material or any
other medium includes electronically stored information.’’). A newspaper or periodical should be
available to the public online, digitally, or in print, principally devoted to the dissemination of local
or general news and other editorial content, adherent to journalistic ethics and standards, and updating its content on a regular basis. For online newspapers and periodicals, links to other web content
may be included, but the core content must reside on a server or website.
Pa.R.E. 902(6) permits both printed and digital newspapers and periodicals to be self-authenticated.
Evidence purported to be an article or item from a newspaper or periodical must contain sufficient
indicia of its original publication, including, but not limited to, the publication’s title; the date of publication; page or volume of the article or item, if the content appeared in print; and web address, if
applicable, where the article or item was originally published.
Pa.R.E. 902(7) is identical to F.R.E. 902(7).

Pa.R.E. 902(8) is identical to F.R.E. 902(8). It is consistent with Pennsylvania law. See Sheaffer v.
Baeringer, 29 A.2d 697 (Pa. 1943); Williamson v. Barrett, 24 A.2d 546 (Pa. Super. 1942); 57 Pa.C.S.
§§ 301—331 (Revised Uniform Law on Notarial Acts). An acknowledged document is a type of official record and the treatment of acknowledged documents is consistent with Pa.R.E. 902(1), (2), (3),
and (4).
Pa.R.E. 902(9) is identical to F.R.E. 902(9). Pennsylvania law treats various kinds of commercial
paper and documents as self-authenticating. See, e.g., 13 Pa.C.S. § 3505 (evidence of dishonor of
negotiable instruments).
Pa.R.E. 902(10) differs from F.R.E. 902(10) to eliminate the reference to Federal law and to make
the paragraph conform to Pennsylvania law. In some Pennsylvania statutes, the self-authenticating
nature of a document is expressed by language creating a ‘‘presumption’’ of authenticity. See, e.g., 13
Pa.C.S. § 3505.
Pa.R.E. 902(11) and (12) permit the authentication of domestic and foreign records of regularly
conducted activity by verification or certification. Pa.R.E. 902(11) is similar to F.R.E. 902(11). The
language of Pa.R.E. 902(11) differs from F.R.E. 902(11) in that it refers to Pa.R.C.P. No. 76 rather
than to Federal law. Pa.R.E. 902(12) differs from F.R.E. 902(12) in that it requires compliance with
a Pennsylvania statute rather than a Federal statute.
Pa.R.E. 902(13) is identical to F.R.E. 902(13). This rule establishes a procedure by which parties
can authenticate certain electronic evidence other than through the testimony of a foundation witness.
The rule specifically allows the authenticity foundation that satisfies Rule 901(b)(9) to be established
by a certification rather than the testimony of a live witness. A proponent establishing authenticity
under this rule must present a certification containing information that would be sufficient to establish authenticity were that information provided by a witness at trial. If the certification provides
information that would be insufficient to authenticate the record if the certifying person testified, then
authenticity is not established under this rule.
A certification under this rule can establish only that the proffered item has satisfied the admissibility requirements for authenticity. The opponent remains free to object to admissibility of the proffered item on other grounds—including hearsay, relevance, or in criminal cases the right to confrontation. For example, a certification authenticating a computer output, such as a spreadsheet or a
printout of a webpage, does not preclude an objection that the information produced is unreliable—
the authentication establishes only that the output came from the computer.
The reference to the ‘‘certification requirements of Rule 902(11) or (12)’’ is only to the procedural
requirements for a valid certification. There is no intent to require, or permit, a certification under this
rule to prove the requirements of Rule 803(6). Rule 902(13) is solely limited to authentication of a
record generated by an electronic process or system and any attempt to satisfy a hearsay exception
must be made independently.
A challenge to the authenticity of electronic evidence may require technical information about the
system or process at issue, including possibly retaining a forensic technical expert; such factors will
affect whether the opponent has a fair opportunity to challenge the evidence given the notice provided.
Nothing in Rule 902(13) is intended to limit a party from establishing authenticity of electronic
evidence on any ground provided in these Rules.
Pa.R.E. 902(14) is identical to F.R.E. 902(14). This rule establishes a procedure by which parties
can authenticate data copied from an electronic device, storage medium, or an electronic file, using a
certificate rather than through the testimony of a foundation witness. A proponent establishing authenticity under this rule must present a certification containing information that would be sufficient to
establish authenticity were that information provided by a witness at trial. If the certification provides
AUTHENTICATION AND IDENTIFICATION 225 Rule 902
9-7

information that would be insufficient to authenticate the record if the certifying person testified, then
authenticity is not established under this rule.
Today, data copied from electronic devices, storage media, and electronic files are ordinarily
authenticated by ‘‘hash value.’’ A hash value is a number that is often represented as a sequence of
characters and is produced by an algorithm based upon the digital contents of a drive, medium, or
file. If the hash values for the original and copy are different, then the copy is not identical to the
original. If the hash values for the original and copy are the same, it is highly improbable that the
original and copy are not identical. Thus, identical hash values for the original and copy reliably attest
to the fact that they are exact duplicates. This Rule allows self-authentication by a certification of a
qualified person that she checked the hash value of the proffered item and that it was identical to the
original. The Rule is flexible enough to allow certifications through processes other than comparison
of hash value, including by other reliable means of identification provided by future technology.
A certification under this rule can only establish that the proffered item is authentic. The opponent
remains free to object to admissibility of the proffered item on other grounds—including hearsay, relevance, or in criminal cases the right to confrontation. For example, in a criminal case in which data
copied from a hard drive is proffered, the defendant can still challenge hearsay found in the hard
drive, and can still challenge whether the information on the hard drive was placed there by the
defendant.
The reference to the ‘‘certification requirements of Rule 902(11) or (12)’’ is only to the procedural
requirements for a valid certification. There is no intent to require, or permit, a certification under this
rule to prove the requirements of Rule 803(6). Rule 902(14) is solely limited to authentication, and
any attempt to satisfy a hearsay exception must be made independently.
A challenge to the authenticity of electronic evidence may require technical information about the
system or process at issue, including possibly retaining a forensic technical expert; such factors will
affect whether the opponent has a fair opportunity to challenge the evidence given the notice provided.
Nothing in Rule 902(14) is intended to limit a party from establishing authenticity of electronic
evidence on any ground provided in these Rules.
Pa.R.E. 902 (15) has no counterpart in the Federal Rules. This rule provides for the selfauthentication of a certificate of the non-existence of a public record, as provided in Pa.R.E.
803(10)(A).

Rule 1001. Definitions That Apply to This Article.
In this article:
(a) A ‘‘writing’’ consists of letters, words, numbers, or their equivalent set
down in any form.
(b) A ‘‘recording’’ consists of letters, words, numbers, or their equivalent
recorded in any manner.
(c) A ‘‘photograph’’ means a photographic image or its equivalent stored in
any form.
(d) An ‘‘original’’ of a writing or recording means the writing or recording
itself or any counterpart intended to have the same effect by the person who
executed or issued it. For electronically stored information, ‘‘original’’ means any
printout—or other output readable by sight—if it accurately reflects the information. An ‘‘original’’ of a photograph includes the negative or a print from it.
(e) A ‘‘duplicate’’ means a copy produced by a mechanical, photographic,
chemical, electronic, or other equivalent process or technique that accurately
reproduces the original.
Comment
This rule is identical to F.R.E. 1001, except that the word ‘‘copy’’ in Pa.R.E 1001(e) replaces the
word ‘‘counterpart’’ used in F.R.E. 1001(e).
Paragraph 1001(e) defines the term duplicate. This term is important because of the admissibility
of duplicates under Pa.R.E. 1003. This rule differs from the Federal Rule in that the word ‘‘counterpart’’ has been replaced by the word ‘‘copy.’’ The word ‘‘counterpart’’ is used in paragraph 1001(d)
to refer to a copy intended to have the same effect as the writing or recording itself. The word ‘‘copy’’
is used in paragraph 1003(e) to mean a copy that was not intended to have the same effect as the
original.
Pennsylvania law has permitted the use of duplicates produced by the same impression as the
original, as is the case with carbon copies. See Brenner v. Lesher, 332 Pa. 522, 2 A.2d 731 (1938);
Commonwealth v. Johnson, 373 Pa. Super. 312, 541 A.2d 332 (1988); Pennsylvania Liquor Control
Bd. v. Evolo, 204 Pa. Super. 225, 203 A.2d 332 (1964). Pennsylvania has not treated other duplicates
as admissible unless the original was shown to be unavailable through no fault of the proponent. For
this reason, the definition of duplicates, other than those produced by the same impression as the
original, is new to Pennsylvania law. The justification for adopting the new definition is discussed in
the Comment to Pa.R.E. 1003.

Rule 1002. Requirement of the Original.
An original writing, recording, or photograph is required in order to prove its
content unless these rules, other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court, or a statute provides otherwise.
Comment
Pa.R.E. 1002 differs from F.R.E. 1002 to eliminate the reference to Federal law.
This rule corresponds to the common law ‘‘best evidence rule.’’ See Hera v. McCormick, 425 Pa.
Super. 432, 625 A.2d 682 (1993). The rationale for the rule was not expressed in Pennsylvania cases,
but commentators have mentioned four reasons justifying the rule.
(1) The exact words of many documents, especially operative or dispositive documents, such as
deeds, wills or contracts, are so important in determining a party’s rights accruing under those documents.
(2) Secondary evidence of the contents of documents, whether copies or testimony, is susceptible
to inaccuracy.
(3) The rule inhibits fraud because it allows the parties to examine the original documents to detect
alterations and erroneous testimony about the contents of the document.
(4) The appearance of the original may furnish information as to its authenticity.
5 Weinstein & Berger, Weinstein’s Evidence § 1002(2) (Sandra D. Katz rev. 1994).
The common law formulation of the rule provided that the rule was applicable when the terms of
the document were ‘‘material.’’ The materiality requirement has not been eliminated, but is now dealt
with in Pa.R.E. 1004(d). That rule provides that the original is not required when the writing, recording or photograph is not closely related to a controlling issue.
The case law has not been entirely clear as to when a party is trying ‘‘to prove the content of a
writing, recording, or photograph.’’ However, writings that are viewed as operative or dispositive have
usually been considered to be subject to the operation of the rule. On the other hand, writings are not
usually treated as subject to the rule if they are only evidence of the transaction, thing or event. See
Hamill-Quinlan, Inc. v. Fisher, 404 Pa. Super. 482, 591 A.2d 309 (1991); Noble C. Quandel Co. v.
Slough Flooring, Inc., 384 Pa. Super. 236, 558 A.2d 99 (1989). Thus, testimony as to a person’s age
may be offered; it is not necessary to produce a birth certificate. See Commonwealth ex rel. Park v.
Joyce, 316 Pa. 434, 175 A. 422 (1934). Or, a party’s earnings may be proven by testimony; it is not
necessary to offer business records. See Noble C. Quandel Co., supra.
Traditionally, the best evidence rule applied only to writings, but Pa.R.E. 1002 may be applicable
to recordings or photographs. However, recordings and photographs are usually only evidence of the
transaction, thing or event. It is rare that a recording or photograph would be operative or dispositive,
but in cases involving matters such as infringement of copyright, defamation, pornography and inva225 Rule 1002 RULES OF EVIDENCE

sion of privacy, the requirement for the production of the original should be applicable. There is support for this approach in Pennsylvania law. See Commonwealth v. Lewis, 424 Pa. Super. 531, 623 A.2d
355 (1993) (video tape); Anderson v. Commonwealth, 121 Pa. Cmwlth. 521, 550 A.2d 1049 (1988)

Rule 1003. Admissibility of Duplicates.
A duplicate is admissible to the same extent as the original unless a genuine
question is raised about the original’s authenticity or the circumstances make it
unfair to admit the duplicate.
Comment
This rule is identical to F.R.E. 1003.
Under the traditional best evidence rule, copies of documents were not routinely admissible. This
view dated back to the time when copies were made by hand copying and were therefore subject to
inaccuracy. On the other hand, Pennsylvania courts have admitted copies made by techniques that are
more likely to produce accurate copies. For example, when a writing is produced in duplicate or multiplicate each of the copies is treated as admissible for purposes of the best evidence rule. See Brenner v. Lesher, 332 Pa. 522, 2 A.2d 731 (1938); Pennsylvania Liquor Control Bd. v. Evolo, 204 Pa.
Super. 225, 203 A.2d 332 (1964).
In addition, various Pennsylvania statutes have treated some accurate copies as admissible. See 42
Pa.C.S. § 6104 (governmental records in the Commonwealth); 42 Pa.C.S. § 5328 (domestic records
outside the Commonwealth and foreign records); 42 Pa.C.S. § 6106 (documents recorded or filed in
a public office); 42 Pa.C.S. § 6109 (photographic copies of business and public records); 42 Pa.C.S.
§§ 6151—59 (certified copies of medical records).
The extension of similar treatment to all accurate copies seems justified in light of modern practice. Pleading and discovery rules such as Pa.R.C.P. No. 4009.1 (requiring production of originals of
documents and photographs etc.) and Pa.R.Crim.P. 573(B)(1)(f) and (g) (requiring disclosure of originals of documents, photographs and recordings of electronic surveillance) will usually provide an
adequate opportunity to discover fraudulent copies. As a result, Pa.R.E. 1003 should tend to eliminate
purely technical objections and unnecessary delay. In those cases where the opposing party raises a
genuine question as to authenticity or the fairness of using a duplicate, the trial court may require the
production of the original under this rule.

Rule 1004. Admissibility of Other Evidence of Content.
An original is not required and other evidence of the content of a writing,
recording, or photograph is admissible if:
(a) all the originals are lost or destroyed, and not by the proponent acting in
bad faith;
(b) an original cannot be obtained by any available judicial process;
(c) the party against whom the original would be offered had control of the
original; was at that time put on notice, by pleadings or otherwise, that the original would be a subject of proof at the trial or hearing; and fails to produce it at
the trial or hearing; or
(d) the writing, recording, or photograph is not closely related to a controlling issue.
Comment
This rule is identical to F.R.E. 1004.
When the proponent of the evidence alleges that it is lost, there should be evidence that a sufficient search was made. See Hera v. McCormick, 425 Pa. Super. 432, 625 A.2d 682 (1993).
Under Pa.R.E. 1004, when production of the original is not required, the proffering party need not
offer a duplicate even if that is available; the proffering party may present any evidence including oral
testimony. The normal motivation of a party to produce the most convincing evidence together with
the availability of discovery to uncover fraud seems adequate to control abuse.

Rule 1005. Copies of Public Records to Prove Content.
The proponent may use a copy to prove the content of an official record—or
of a document that was recorded or filed in a public office as authorized by
law—if these conditions are met: the record or document is otherwise admissible;
and the copy is certified as correct in accordance with Rule 902(4) or is testified
to be correct by a witness who has compared it with the original. If no such copy
can be obtained by reasonable diligence, then the proponent may use other evidence to prove the content.

The proponent may use a summary, chart, or calculation to prove the content
of voluminous writings, recordings, or photographs that cannot be conveniently
examined in court. The proponent must make the originals or duplicates available
for examination or copying, or both, by other parties at a reasonable time and

Rule 1007. Testimony or Statement of a Party to Prove Content.
The proponent may prove the content of a writing, recording, or photograph by
the testimony, deposition, or written statement of the party against whom the evidence is offered. The proponent need not account for the original.
Comment
This rule is identical to F.R.E. 1007. There is no precise equivalent to Pa.R.E. 1007 under Pennsylvania law, but the rule is consistent with Pennsylvania practice. For example, Pa.R.C.P. No.
1019(h) requires a party to attach a copy of a writing to a pleading if any claim or defense is based
on the writing. A responsive pleading admitting the accuracy of the writing would preclude an objection based on Rule 1002.
Similarly, Pa.R.C.P. No. 4014(a) permits a party to serve any other party with a request for admission as to the genuineness, authenticity, correctness, execution, signing, delivery, mailing or receipt of
any document described in the request. Pa.R.C.P. No. 4014(d) provides that any matter admitted is
conclusively established.

Rule 1008. Functions of the Court and Jury.
Ordinarily, the court determines whether the proponent has fulfilled the factual
conditions for admitting other evidence of the content of a writing, recording, or
photograph under Rule 1004 or 1005. But in a jury trial, the jury determines—in
accordance with Rule 104(b)—any issue about whether:
(a) an asserted writing, recording, or photograph ever existed;
(b) another one produced at the trial or hearing is the original; or
(c) other evidence of content accurately reflects the content.

Comment
The previous use of ‘‘Pa.R.C.P. No.’’ to cite the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure may not
serve as a basis to invalidate a reference to that authority.
The rules of civil procedure are not applicable in the magisterial district courts. Civil actions and

Rule 205. [Rescinded].
Explanatory Note
Rule 205 provided that the Code of Professional Responsibility of the American Bar Association,
adopted August 12, 1969 and amended February 24, 1970, was the standard of conduct for attorneys
of all courts of the Commonwealth. The Committee has long felt that such a rule was properly a rule
of disciplinary enforcement rather than one of civil procedure.
On June 28, 1976, the Court promulgated the Pennsylvania Rules of Disciplinary Enforcement
which will become effective on October 27, of this year. The Definition of Disciplinary Rules as provided by Rule of Disciplinary Enforcement 102 incorporated the same Code of Professional Responsibility as that specified in Rule of Civil Procedure 205. In view of the duplication of the rules, the
rescission was appropriate.
Rule 205.1. Filing Legal Papers. Mailing. Personal Presentation by Attorney Not Necessary.
Any legal paper not requiring the signature of, or action by, a judge prior to
filing may be delivered or mailed to the prothonotary, sheriff or other appropriate
officer accompanied by the filing fee, if any. Neither the party nor the party’s
attorney need appear personally and present such paper to the officer. The signature of an attorney on a paper constitutes a certification of authorization to file it.
The endorsement of an address where papers may be served in the manner provided by Rule 440(a) shall constitute a sufficient registration of address. The
notation on the paper of the attorney’s current Supreme Court identification number issued by the Court Administrator of Pennsylvania shall constitute proof of
the right to practice in the Commonwealth. A paper sent by mail shall not be
deemed filed until received by the appropriate officer.
Official Note: The address endorsed on the legal paper must be one where the paper may
be handed to or mailed to the attorney. See Rule 440(a)(1).
The filing of legal documents prepared on recycled paper of good quality is encouraged.

Rule 205.2. Filing Legal Papers with the Prothonotary.
No pleading or other legal paper that complies with the Pennsylvania Rules of
Civil Procedure shall be refused for filing by the prothonotary based on a requirement of a local rule of civil procedure or judicial administration, including local
Rules 205.2(a) and 205.2(b).
Official Note: Rule 239.1(a) authorizes each court of common pleas to impose requirements governing the physical characteristics of pleadings and other legal papers. Rule 239.1(a)
requires each court which has imposed requirements to promulgate a local rule, numbered Local
Rule 205.2(a), listing the requirements.
Similarly, Rule 239.1(b) also authorizes each court to require pleadings and other legal papers
to be accompanied by a cover sheet. Rule 239.1(b) requires each court which has imposed the
requirement to promulgate a local rule, numbered Local Rule 205.2(b), stating the requirement
and setting forth the form of the cover sheet.

Rule 205.3. Filing Pleadings and Other Legal Papers with the
Prothonotary. Originals and Copies.
(a) A party may file with the prothonotary an original pleading or other legal
paper, or a copy including a facsimile copy provided that the copy shows that the
original pleading or other legal paper was properly signed and, where applicable,
verified. Except as otherwise provided by law, the copy shall be deemed the
equivalent of the original document.
Official Note: This rule does not authorize the filing of legal papers with the prothonotary
by facsimile transmission, but, rather, authorized the filing of a non-original facsimile or other
copy. See Rule 205.1 governing the manner of filing with the prothonotary.
See Rule 76 for the definition of facsimile copy.
The facsimile copy must be on paper of good quality. See Pa.R.A.P. 124(a)(1).
(b) If a party has filed of record a copy of a pleading or other legal paper, any
other party may require the filing of the original document by filing with the prothonotary and serving upon the party who filed the copy a notice to file the original document with the prothonotary within fourteen days of the filing of the
notice.

Rule 205.4. Electronic Filing and Service of Legal Papers.
(a)(1) A court by local rule may permit or require electronic filing of legal
papers with the prothonotary and shall specify the actions and proceedings and
the legal papers subject to the rule.
Official Note: This rule does not require the implementation of electronic filing by a local
court.
If a court determines that legal papers may be filed electronically with the prothonotary, Rule
239.9(a) requires the court to promulgate Local Rule 205.4 which shall describe the electronic
filing system program and set forth the practice and procedure for the matters required by this
rule.
If a court provides that electronic filing is mandatory, it must also provide the necessary technical assistance to those parties who lack the capability to file legal papers electronically.

meanings:
‘‘electronic filing,’’ the electronic transmission of legal papers by means
other than facsimile transmission,
‘‘filing party,’’ an attorney, party or other person who files a legal paper
by means of electronic filing, and
‘‘legal paper,’’ a pleading or other paper filed in an action, including

the electronic format for presenting legal papers for filing.
(2) A legal paper filed electronically shall be deemed the original document.
(3) The electronic filing of a legal paper constitutes a certification
(i) by the filing party that a hard copy of the legal paper was properly
signed and, where applicable, verified, and
(ii) as provided by Rule 1023.1(c) governing the signature to a legal
paper, the violation of which shall be subject to the sanction provision of
Rule 1023.1(d).
(4) The filing party shall maintain the signed hard copy of the document
filed for two years after the later of
(i) the disposition of the case,
(ii) the entry of an order resolving the issue raised by the legal paper,
or

of the notice. The court upon motion may grant appropriate sanctions for failure to produce the signed hard copy pursuant to the notice.
(c)(1) The prothonotary when authorized to accept filings by electronic transmission shall provide electronic access at all times.
(2) The prothonotary may designate a website for the electronic filing of
legal papers. Access to the website shall be available by the attorney identification number issued by the Court Administrator of Pennsylvania. The court by
local rule shall designate the manner of access to the website for a filing party
who is not an attorney.

the manner of access to the website by a filing party who is not an attorney.
(3) The time and date of filing submission and receipt of the legal paper to
be filed electronically shall be that registered by the electronic filing system.
The prothonotary shall provide, through the electronic filing system’s website,
an acknowledgement that the legal paper has been received, including the date
and time of receipt, in a form which can be printed for retention by the filing
party.
(d)(1) A filing party shall pay the cost of the electronic filing of a legal paper
by approved credit or debit card, or by advance deposit of sufficient funds with
the prothonotary if the court by local rule so provides.
(2) A filing party who presents the legal paper for electronic filing in person at the office of the prothonotary shall pay the cost by a method prescribed
by paragraph (1) or by check or cash.
(3) If a court has designated a third party to operate the electronic filing
system, the filing party shall pay the cost of the electronic filing to the prothonotary or to the third party operator in the manner provided by local rule.
Official Note: Rule 239.9(b)(4) requires that subdivision (d)(1) of Local Rule 205.4 list the
credit and debit cards approved by the court or the prothonotary, and state whether the filing fee
may be paid by depositing, in advance, sufficient funds with the prothonotary.
Rule 239.9(b)(5) provides for subdivision (d)(3) of Local Rule 205.4 to govern the payment
of the filing fee to a third party operator, if applicable.
(e)(1) A filing party shall be responsible for any delay, disruption, interruption of the electronic signals and legibility of the document electronically filed,
except when caused by the failure of the electronic filing system’s website.
Official Note: The filing party accepts the risk that a document filed by means of electronic
filing may not be properly or timely filed with the prothonotary.
(2) No pleading or other legal paper that complies with the Pennsylvania
Rules of Civil Procedure shall be refused for filing by the prothonotary or the
electronic filing system based upon a requirement of a local rule or local
administrative procedure or practice pertaining to the electronic filing of legal
papers.

(3) If a pleading or other legal paper is not accepted upon presentation for

or the electronic filing system, as may be appropriate, shall immediately notify
BUSINESS OF COURTS 231 Rule 205.4
200-7
(331691) No. 399 Feb. 08
the party presenting the legal paper for filing of the date of presentation, the
fact that the document was not accepted or refused for filing by the system, and
the reason therefor.
(4)(i) The court upon motion shall resolve any dispute arising under paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision.
(ii) If a party makes a good faith effort to electronically file a legal
paper but it is not received, accepted or filed by the electronic filing system,
the court may order that the paper be accepted and filed nunc pro tunc upon
a showing that reasonable efforts were made to timely present and file the
paper.
(f) When electronic filing is permitted as set forth in subdivision (a)(1), the
court by local rule shall provide for
(1) a filing status message to the filing party,
(2) the maintenance by the prothonotary of an electronic file only, or of
such electronic and such hard copy files as set forth in the rule,
Official Note: A hard copy file is not required by this rule. If the local rule requires a hard
copy file, the requirement may extend to all cases or only to certain specified cases. For
example, the court may require hard copy files for cases listed for trial or scheduled for argument while maintaining only electronic files for all other cases.
(3) additional procedures, if necessary, to ensure the security of the web
site and the electronic files,
(4) procedures for the payment of prothonotary’s fees and costs, and
(5) such other procedures and matters necessary to the operation of a system of electronic filing.

forth the practice and procedure with respect to the matters required by subdivision (f) of this
rule.
(g)(1) Copies of all legal papers other than original process filed in an action
or served upon any party to an action may be served
(i) as provided by Rule 440 or
(ii) by electronic transmission, other than facsimile transmission, if the
parties agree thereto or an electronic mail address is included on an appearance or prior legal paper filed with the court in the action. A paper served
electronically is subject to the certifications set forth in subdivision (b)(3).
(2) Service by electronic transmission is complete when a legal paper is
sent
(i) to the recipient’s electronic mail address, or
(ii) to an electronic filing system website and an e-mail message is sent
to the recipient by the electronic filing system that the legal paper has been
filed and is available for review on the system’s website.
Official Note: Upon the electronic filing of a legal paper other than original process, the
electronic filing system may automatically send notice of the filing to all parties who have
agreed to service by electronic transmission or whose e-mail address is included on an appearance or prior legal paper filed in connection with the action. If the electronic filing system sends
notice of such filing, the party filing the legal paper only need serve those parties who are not
served by the electronic filing system.

Rule 207.1. Motion to Exclude Expert Testimony Which Relies Upon
Novel Scientific Evidence
(a) If a party moves the court to exclude expert testimony which relies upon
novel scientific evidence, on the basis that it is inadmissible under Pa.R.E. 702
or 703,
(1) the motion shall contain:
(i) the name and credentials of the expert witness whose testimony is
sought to be excluded,
(ii) a summary of the expected testimony of the expert witness, specifying with particularity that portion of the testimony of the witness which the
moving party seeks to exclude,
(iii) the basis, set forth with specificity, for excluding the evidence,
(iv) the evidence upon which the moving party relies, and
(v) copies of all relevant curriculum vitae and expert reports;
(2) any other party need not respond to the motion unless ordered by the
court;
(3) the court shall initially review the motion to determine if, in the interest of justice, the matter should be addressed prior to trial. The court, without
further proceedings, may determine that any issue of admissibility of expert
testimony be deferred until trial; and
(4) the court shall require that a response be filed If it determines that the
matter should be addressed prior to trial.
Official Note: This rule establishes procedures for motions to exclude expert testimony
which relies upon novel scientific evidence. The rule does not address the requirements for the
admission of expert testimony under Pa.R.E. 702 and 703, which are governed by case law. It
also does not address motions under those rules on other grounds.
The court has discretion in the manner in which it determines the motion. While depositions
of expert witnesses and evidentiary hearings are available to the court for this purpose, they
should be utilized in limited circumstances. See the limitations set forth in Rule 4003.5 governing discovery of expert testimony.
In deciding whether to address prior to trial the admissibility of the testimony of an expert
witness, the following factors are among those which the court should consider: the dispositive
nature or significance of the issue to the case, the complexity of the issue involved in the testimony of the expert witness, the degree of novelty of the proposed evidence, the complexity of
the case, the anticipated length of trial, the potential for delay of trial, and the feasibility of the
court evaluating the expert witness’ testimony when offered at trial.
When a ruling on a pre-trial motion to exclude the testimony of an expert witness is deferred
until trial, the trial judge may choose to decide the motion (1) before the expert witness testifies
on the basis of evidence offered outside the presence of the jury or (2) after the expert witness
testifies on the basis of testimony offered at trial, in which event the trial judge will strike the
testimony of the expert witness if it is found to be inadmissible under Pa.R.E. 702 or 703. However, hearings on preliminary matters must be conducted outside the presence of the jury ‘‘when
the interests of justice require.’’ See Pa.R.E. 104.

original process, Rule 1023.1 governing the signing of documents, and Rule 1025 governing the
endorsement of legal papers. Any requirements of a court relating to the format of a motion and
cover sheet must be set forth in local rules numbered Local Rule 205.2(a) and Local Rule
205.2(b).
(b) A motion need not be verified unless verification is required by general
rule governing the particular motion or by order of court.
Official Note: Rule 239.3(a) authorizes a court to require that a motion include a brief
statement of the applicable authority. Rule 239.3(a) requires each court which has imposed this
requirement to promulgate a local rule, numbered Local Rule 208.2(c), stating the requirement.

in any motion relating to discovery to certify that counsel has conferred or attempted to confer
with all interested parties in order to resolve the matter without court action. Rule 239.3(c)
requires each court which has imposed this requirement to promulgate a local rule, numbered

Rule 208.3. Alternative Procedures.
(a) Except as otherwise provided by subdivision (b), the court shall initially
consider a motion without written responses or briefs. For a motion governed by
this subdivision, the court may not enter an order that grants relief to the moving
party unless the motion is presented as uncontested or the other parties to the
proceeding are given an opportunity for an argument.
Official Note: Rule 208.3(a) does not prevent a court from denying the moving party’s
request for relief without the opportunity for an argument where the motion is procedurally
defective, is untimely filed or fails to set forth adequate grounds for relief.
Parties may choose to submit responses and briefs at the time of the presentation, provided
that copies have been served on every other party. However, parties are not required to do so.
Rule 239.3(d) requires every court to promulgate Local Rule 208.3(a) describing the local
court procedure governing motions under this rule.

(b) A court, by local rule, numbered Local Rule 208.3(b), may impose
requirements with respect to motions listed in the rule for the filing of a response,
a brief or both. Where a response is required, any party opposing a motion governed by Local Rule 208.3(b) shall file the response within twenty days after service of the motion, unless the time for filing the response is modified by court
order or enlarged by local rule.
Official Note: Motions are governed by the procedure in subdivision (a) unless the court
by local rule designates particular types of motions to be governed by the procedure in subdivision (b).
The twenty-day response period may be extended or reduced by special order of court. A
local rule may only extend the time period.
A response shall be filed by any party opposing a motion governed by subdivision (b) even
if there are no contested issues of fact because the response is the opposing party’s method of
indicating its opposition.
Rule 208.3(b) authorizes each court of common pleas to impose requirements of responses
and briefs with respect to designated motions. Rule 239.3(e) requires each court which has
imposed such requirements to promulgate a local rule, numbered Local Rule 208.3(b), listing the
motions and the requirements.
Rule 239.3(e) also provides that Local Rule 208.3(b) must describe the local court procedure

party including the moving party, may enter an order in the form set forth in
paragraph (2) providing for the issuance of a rule to show cause. The procedure
following issuance of the rule to show cause shall be in accordance with Rule
206.7.
Official Note: A court will not necessarily utilize the rule to show cause procedure of subdivision (b) because other methods for developing the record, such as the filing of affidavits,

(e) A cause of action for the wrongful death of a decedent and a cause of
action for the injuries of the decedant which survives his or her death may be
enforced in one action, but if independent actions are commenced they shall be
consolidated for trial.
(1) If independent actions are commenced or are pending in the same
court, the court, on its own motion or the motion of any party, shall order the
actions consolidated for trial.
(2) If independent actions are commenced in different courts, the court in
which the second action was commenced, on its own motion or the motion of
any party, shall order the action transferred to the court in which the first action
was commenced.
(3) If an action is commenced to enforce one cause of action, the court, on

is commenced to enforce the other cause of action and is consolidated therewith or until the commencement of such second action is barred by the applicable statute of limitation.
(f) When an action is commenced in a court which has no jurisdiction over
the subject matter of the action it shall not be dismissed if there is another court
of appropriate jurisdiction within the Commonwealth in which the action could
originally have been brought but the court shall transfer the action at the cost of
the plaintiff to the court of appropriate jurisdiction. It shall be the duty of the
prothonotary or clerk of the court in which the action is commenced to transfer
the record together with a certified copy of the docket entries to the prothonotary
or clerk of the court to which the action is transferred.

Explanatory Note
Prior to 1969, two county courts existed in Pennsylvania. The Municipal Court of Philadelphia was
created by the Act of July 12, 1913, P. L. 711, § 1, 17 P. S. § 681, and subsequently renamed the
County Court of Philadelphia by the Act of July 17, 1961, P. L. 781, § 1, 17 P. S. § 705. The County
Court of Allegheny County was created by the Act of May 5, 1911, P. L. 198, § 1, 17 P. S. § 621.
Both of these courts were abolished by the Constitution of 1968.
Business of the Court Rules 213(c) and (d) refer to transfers between county courts and common
pleas courts. Joinder of Parties Rule 2231(b) is predicated on the jurisdiction of the county courts.
These sub-divisions are obsolete.
Trespass Rule 1044(c) refers to county courts. This reference is also obsolete.
Rules 213(c) and (d) and 2231(b) have been rescinded and the reference to a county court in Rule
1044(c) has been deleted. Appropriate notes have been added to each Rule.

Rule 213.1. Coordination of Actions in Different Counties.
(a) In actions pending in different counties which involve a common question
of law or fact or which arise from the same transaction or occurrence, any party,
with notice to all other parties, may file a motion requesting the court in which
a complaint was first filed to order coordination of the actions. Any party may
file an answer to the motion and the court may hold a hearing.
(b) The court in which the complaint was first filed may stay the proceedings
in any action which is the subject of the motion.
(c) In determining whether to order coordination and which location is appropriate for the coordinated proceedings, the court shall consider, among other matters:
(1) whether the common question of fact or law is predominating and significant to the litigation;
(2) the convenience of the parties, witnesses and counsel;
(3) whether coordination will result in unreasonable delay or expense to a
party or otherwise prejudice a party in an action which would be subject to
coordination;
(4) the efficient utilization of judicial facilities and personnel and the just
and efficient conduct of the actions;
(5) the disadvantages of duplicative and inconsistent rulings, orders or
judgments;
(6) the likelihood of settlement of the actions without further litigation
should coordination be denied.
(d) If the court orders that actions shall be coordinated, it may
(1) stay any or all of the proceedings in any action subject to the order, or
(2) transfer any or all further proceedings in the actions to the court or
courts in which any of the action is pending, or
(3) make any other appropriate order.
(e) In the order of coordination, the court shall include the manner of giving
notice of the order to all parties in all actions subject thereto and direct that
specified parties pay the costs, if any, of coordination. The court shall also order
that a certified copy of the order of coordination be sent to the courts in which
the actions subject to the order are pending, whereupon whose courts shall take
such action as may be appropriate to carry out the coordination order.
(f) The final order disposing of a coordinated action or proceeding shall be
certified and sent to the court in which the action was originally commenced to
be filed of record.

Rule 216. Grounds for Continuance.
(a) The following are grounds for continuance:
(1) Agreement of all parties or their attorneys, if approved by the Court;
(2) Illness of counsel of record, a material witness, or a party. If requested
a certificate of a physician shall be furnished, stating that such illness will
probably be of sufficient duration to prevent the ill person from participating in
the trial;
(3) Inability to subpoena or to take testimony by deposition, commission,
or letters rogatory, of any material witness, shown by affidavit which shall
state:
(i) The facts to which the witness would testify if present or if deposed;
(ii) The grounds for believing that the absent witness would so testify;
(iii) The efforts made to procure the attendance or deposition of such
absent witness; and
(iv) The reasons for believing that the witness will attend the trial at a
subsequent date, or that the deposition of the witness can and will be
obtained.
(4) Such special ground as may be allowed in the discretion of the court;
(5) The scheduling of counsel to appear at any proceeding under the Pennsylvania Rules of Disciplinary Enforcement, whether:
(i) as counsel for a respondent-attorney before a hearing committee,
hearing officer, the Disciplinary Board or the Supreme Court;
(ii) as a hearing officer or member of a hearing committee; or
(iii) as a member of the Disciplinary Board;
BUSINESS OF COURTS 231 Rule 215
200-15
(415445) No. 588 Nov. 23
(6) The scheduling of counsel to appear at any proceeding involving the
discipline of a justice, judge or magisterial district judge under Section 18 of
Article V of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, whether:
(i) as counsel for a justice, judge, or magisterial district judge before
the special tribunal provided for in 42 Pa.C.S. § 727, the Court of Judicial
Discipline, the Judicial Conduct Board or any hearing committee or other
arm of the Judicial Conduct Board; or
(ii) as a member of the Court of Judicial Discipline, the Judicial Conduct Board or any hearing committee or other arm of the Judicial Conduct
Board.
(b) Except for cause shown in special cases, no reason above enumerated for
the continuance of a case shall be of effect beyond one application made in behalf
of one party or group of parties having similar interests.
(c) No application for a continuance shall be granted if based on a cause
existing and known at the time of publication or prior call of the trial list unless
the same is presented to the court at a time fixed by the court, which shall be at
least one week before the first day of the trial period. Applications for continuances shall be made to the court, or filed in writing with the officer in charge of
the trial list, after giving notice of such application by mail, or otherwise, to all
parties or their attorneys. Each court may, by local rule, designate the time of
publication of the trial list for the purposes of this rule.
(d) No continuance shall be granted due to the absence from court of a witness duly subpoenaed, unless:
(1) Such witness will be absent because of facts arising subsequent to the
service of the subpoena and which would be a proper ground for continuance
under the provisions of Rule 216(a); or
(2) On the day when the presence of such witness is required a prompt
application is made for the attachment of such absent witness; or
(3) The witness, having attended at court has departed without leave, and
an application for attachment is made promptly after the discovery of the
absence of such witness; or the court is satisfied that the witness has left court
for reasons which would be a proper ground for continuance under Rule
216(a).
(e) Each Court may adopt local rules providing for the temporary passing of
cases or governing applications for continuance because of the absence of a witness, not a party, who has not been served with a subpoena.
(f) Rule 216(b)—(e) and Rule 217 shall not be applicable to a continuance
granted for any of the reasons set forth in Rule 216(a)(5) or (6).

Rule 217. Costs on Continuance.
When a continuance is granted upon application made subsequent to the preliminary call of the trial list, the court may impose on the party making the application the reasonable costs actually incurred by the opposing party which would
not have been incurred if the application had been made at or prior to such preliminary call.
Where a continuance has been so granted and costs imposed, the party upon
whom such costs have been imposed, may not, so long as such costs remain
unpaid, take any further step in such suit without prior leave of court.
A party upon whom such costs are so imposed and who was at fault in delaying the application for continuance may not recover such costs, if ultimately successful in the action; otherwise such costs shall follow the judgment in the action.

Rule 218. Party not Ready when Case is Called for Trial.
(a) Where a case is called for trial, if without satisfactory excuse a plaintiff
is not ready the court may enter a nonsuit on motion of the defendant or a non
pros on the court’s own motion.
(b) If without satisfactory excuse a defendant is not ready, the plaintiff may
(1) proceed to trial, or,
(2) if the case called for trial is an appeal from compulsory arbitration,
either proceed to trial or request the court to dismiss the appeal and reinstate
the arbitration award.
Official Note: See Rule 1007.1(c)(2) for withdrawal of demand for trial by jury when a
party who has filed a demand therefor fails to appear or is not ready.
(c) A party who fails to appear for trial shall be deemed to be not ready without satisfactory excuse.
Official Note: The mere failure to appear for trial is a ground for the entry of a nonsuit or
a judgment of nonpros or the reinstatement of a compulsory arbitration award.
A nonsuit is subject to the filing of a motion under Rule 227.1(a)(3) for post-trial relief to
remove the nonsuit and a judgment of non pros is subject to the filing of a petition under Rule
3051 for relief from a judgment of non pros.
A decision of the court following a trial at which the defendant failed to appear is subject to
the filing of a motion for post-trial relief which may include a request for a new trial on the
ground of a satisfactory excuse for the defendant’s failure to appear.

bar during the actual trial of the case. In all such cases, the allowance of the
application shall be within the discretion of the court, which may impose upon

Rule 220.1. Preliminary Instructions to Prospective and Selected Jurors.
(a) For purposes of this rule, ‘‘prospective jurors’’ means those persons who
have been chosen to be part of the panel from which the trial jurors and alternate
jurors will be selected. ‘‘Selected jurors’’ means those members of the panel who

(422069) No. 605 Apr. 25
(c) Juror Information. Voir dire shall be conducted to provide the opportunity
to obtain, at a minimum, a full description of the following information, where
relevant, concerning the prospective jurors and their households:
(1) name;
(2) year and place of birth;
(3) residential neighborhood and zip code (not street address);
(4) marital status;
(5) nature and extent of education;
(6) number and ages of children;
(7) name, age, and relationship of members of prospective juror’s household;
(8) occupation and employment history of the prospective juror, the juror’s
spouse and children, and members of the juror’s household;
(9) involvement as a party or a witness in a civil lawsuit or a criminal case;
(10) relationship, friendship, or association with a law enforcement officer,
a lawyer, or any person affiliated with the courts of any judicial district;
(11) relationship of the prospective juror or any member of the prospective
juror’s immediate family to the insurance industry, including employee, claims
adjustor, investigator, agent, or stockholder in an insurance company;
(12) motor vehicle operation and licensure;
(13) physical or mental condition affecting ability to serve on a jury;
(14) reasons the prospective juror believes the prospective juror cannot or
should not serve as a juror;
(15) relationship, friendship, or association with the parties, the attorneys,
and prospective witnesses of the particular case to be heard;
(16) ability to refrain from using a computer, cellular telephone, or other
electronic device with communication capabilities in violation of the provisions
of Rule 220.1; and
(17) such other pertinent information as may be appropriate to the particular
case to achieve a competent, fair, and impartial jury.
(d) Voir Dire by Written Questionnaire Permitted. The court may provide for
voir dire to include the use of a written questionnaire. The use of a written questionnaire without the opportunity for oral examination by the court or counsel is
not a sufficient voir dire.
(e) Individual Voir Dire Permitted. The court may permit all or part of the
examination of a juror out of the presence of other jurors.
(f) Recording of Voir Dire. Voir dire, including all rulings by a judge, shall be
recorded in full unless the recording is waived by all parties. The recording shall
be transcribed only upon written request of a party or order of court.
Comment:
Subdivision (a)—The permitted waiver is a waiver only of the judge’s physical presence during
voir dire. It is not a waiver of a party’s opportunity to create a record or to have the judge make decisions based upon that record. This subdivision is also intended to provide flexibility to permit another
judge, or a senior judge, in the judicial district to preside over voir dire, as circumstances warrant.
Subdivision (c)(17)—See Capoferri v. Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, 893 A.2d 133 (Pa.
Super. 2006) (en banc) (voir dire should have been allowed with respect to the effect of pre-trial pub231 Rule 220.3 GENERAL
200-20
(422070) No. 605 Apr. 25 Copyright  2025 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
licity on prospective jurors’ ‘‘attitudes regarding medical malpractice and tort reform’’), as an example
of the type of information that may be sought from potential jurors to achieve a competent, fair, and
impartial jury in a particular case.
Subdivision (d)—The parties or their attorneys may conduct voir dire of the prospective jurors
unless the court itself conducts voir dire or otherwise directs that voir dire be conducted by a court
employee. Any dispute shall be resolved by the court.
A written questionnaire may be used to facilitate and expedite voir dire by providing the trial judge
and attorneys with basic background information about the jurors, thereby eliminating the need for
many commonly asked questions.
Historical Commentary
The following commentary is historical in nature and represents statements of the Committee at the
time of rulemaking:
Explanatory Comment—1997
New Rule 220.1 governing voir dire, the examination of prospective jurors, furthers the goal of
establishing a uniform civil practice throughout the Commonwealth with respect to the information
which the parties may obtain concerning prospective jurors.
The rule specifies the information which the parties should be able to obtain through voir dire but
does not require a particular manner of voir dire. Subdivision (a) is devoted to listing the information
to which the parties are entitled.
The rule does not dictate the mechanics of voir dire, but leaves the method of voir dire to the local
courts of common pleas. Subdivision (b) does give some guidance, however. Voir dire may include
the use of a written questionnaire, but no form of questionnaire is mandated or suggested. The note
observes that a written questionnaire may ‘‘facilitate and expedite’’ voir dire by providing basic background information. The rule provides that ‘‘the use of a written questionnaire without the opportunity for oral examination is not a sufficient voir dire.’’ The parties are entitled to both hear prospective jurors and observe their demeanor.
The rule recognizes that service upon a jury may be a new and disquieting experience to citizens
called as prospective jurors. Information may be sought which a prospective juror feels uncomfortable revealing in open court. Thus, subdivision (c) provides that the ‘‘court may permit all or part of
the examination of a juror out of the presence of other jurors.’’
Explanatory Comment—2008
Rule 220.1 governing voir dire has been amended with the addition of a note to subdivision (a)(16).
Subdivision (a) lists the information to which parties are entitled to obtain during voir dire, concluding with a catch-all provision in subparagraph (16). The note cites Capoferri v. Children’s Hospital of
Philadelphia, 893 A.2d 133 (Pa. Super. 2006) (en banc), as an example of the type of information that
may be sought from potential jurors pursuant to subparagraph (16) to achieve a competent, fair and
impartial jury in a particular case.
Explanatory Comment—2015
The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has adopted new Rules 220.1 and 220.2 and the amendment
of current Rules 220.1 and 223.1. The changes are intended to provide guidance to the bench and bar
regarding the use of electronic devices by jurors in civil cases.
The new rules and amendments provide for jurors to be instructed that the use of electronic devices
is restricted during their tenure as a prospective juror, i.e. a member of the jury pool, and as a selected
juror. The new provisions require the trial court to instruct jurors that they may not conduct independent research on the Internet about the case, communicate about the case electronically, e.g. ‘‘tweet’’
or ‘‘blog,’’ or use such devices during juror service. A trial court is required to instruct jurors at the
earliest opportunity of interaction between the juror and the trial court, and then repeat those instructions as often as practicable. The new rules and amendments provide for sanctions against any person
who violates the provisions of these rules. It should also be noted that a note to new Rule 220.1
cross-references Section 1.180 of the Pennsylvania Suggested Civil Jury Instructions, Pa. SSJI (Civ),
§ 1.180. These instructions specifically address the use of electronic devices by jurors.

While the proposal focuses on the use of electronic devices by jurors, it remains silent as to their
use in the courtroom by the public and media. Rule of Judicial Administration 1910 outlines the
responsibility of a trial court regarding the broadcasting, televising, or taking of photographs in the
courtroom in civil proceedings.

Rule 223.2. Conduct of the Jury Trial. Juror Note Taking.
(a)(1) Jurors shall be permitted to take notes during the presentation of evidence, opening statements, and closing arguments and use their notes during
deliberations.
(2) Jurors shall not be permitted to take notes when the judge is instructing
the jury as to the law that will govern the case.
(b) The court shall give an appropriate cautionary instruction to the jury prior
to opening statements. The instruction shall include:
(1) Jurors are not required to take notes and those who take notes are not
required to take extensive notes;
(2) Note taking should not divert jurors from paying full attention to the
evidence and evaluating witness credibility, the opening statements, or the
closing arguments;
(3) Notes are merely memory aids and are not evidence or the official
record;
(4) Jurors who take few or no notes should not permit their independent
recollection of the evidence to be influenced by the fact that other jurors have
taken notes;
(5) Notes are confidential and will not be reviewed by the court or anyone
else;
(6) A juror may not show his or her notes or disclose their contents to other
jurors until deliberations begin, but may show the notes or disclose the contents
during deliberations;
(7) Jurors shall not take their notes out of the courtroom except to use their
notes during deliberations; and
(8) All juror notes will be collected after the trial is over and immediately
destroyed.
Official Note: It is recommended that the trial judge instruct the jurors along the following
lines:
We will distribute notepads and pens to each of you in the event you wish to take notes during the trial. You are under no obligation to take notes and those who take notes are not required
to take extensive notes.
Remember that one of your responsibilities as a juror is to observe the demeanor of witnesses
to help you assess their credibility. If you do take notes, do not become so involved with note
taking that it interferes with your ability to observe a witness or distracts you from hearing other
answers being given by the witness.
You may also take notes while the attorneys’ present their opening statements and when they
will make their closing arguments about the evidence at the end of the trial. Again, if you do
take notes, do not become so involved with note taking that it distracts from paying attention to
the remainder of the opening statement or hearing all of the closing argument.
Your notes may help you refresh your recollection of the evidence as well as the attorneys’
opening statements or their closing arguments. Your notes should be treated as a supplement to,
rather than a substitute for, your memory. Your notes are only to be used by you as memory aids
and are not evidence or the official record.
Those of you who do not take notes should not permit your independent recollection of the
evidence to be influenced by the fact that other jurors have taken notes. It is just as easy to write
something down incorrectly as it is to remember it incorrectly and your fellow jurors’ notes are
entitled to no greater weight than each juror’s independent memory. Although you may refer to
231 Rule 223.2 GENERAL
200-20.4
(422074) No. 605 Apr. 25 Copyright  2025 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
your notes during deliberations, give no more or no less weight to the view of a fellow juror
just because that juror did or did not take notes.
Each time that we adjourn, your notes will be collected and secured by court staff. Jurors
shall not take their notes out of the courtroom except to use their notes during deliberations.
A juror may not show his or her notes or disclose their contents to other jurors until deliberations begin, but may show the notes or disclose their contents during deliberations. The only
notes you may use during the deliberations are the notes you write in the courtroom during the
proceedings on the materials distributed by the court staff.
Your notes are completely confidential and will not be reviewed by the court or anyone else.
After the trial is over, your notes will be collected by court personnel and immediately
destroyed.
(c) The court shall
(1) provide materials suitable for note taking,
Official Note: The materials provided by the court are the only materials that jurors may
use for note taking.
(2) safeguard all juror notes at each recess and at the end of each trial day,
and
(3) collect all juror notes as soon as the jury is dismissed and, without
inspection, immediately destroy them.
(d)(1) Neither the court nor counsel may (i) request or suggest that jurors take
notes, (ii) comment on their note taking, or (iii) attempt to read any notes.
(2) Juror notes may not be used by any party to the litigation as a basis for
a request for a new trial.
Official Note: A court shall immediately deny a litigant’s request that juror notes be placed
under seal until they are reviewed in connection with a request for a new trial on any ground,
including juror misconduct. The notes shall be destroyed without inspection as soon as the jury
is dismissed.

Rule 223.3. Conduct of the Trial. Actions for Bodily Injury or Death. Jury
Instructions on Noneconomic Loss.
In any action for bodily injury or death in which a plaintiff has raised a claim
for a damage award for noneconomic loss that is viable under applicable substantive law, the court shall give the following instructions to the jury.
The plaintiff has made a claim for a damage award for past and for future noneconomic loss. There are four items that make up a damage award for nonecoBUSINESS OF COURTS 231 Rule 223.3

nomic loss, both past and future: (1) pain and suffering; (2) embarrassment and humiliation; (3)
loss of ability to enjoy the pleasures of life; and (4) disfigurement.
The first item to be considered in the plaintiff’s claims for damage awards
for past noneconomic loss and for future noneconomic loss is pain and suffering.
You are instructed that plaintiff is entitled to be fairly and adequately compensated for all physical pain, mental anguish, discomfort, inconvenience, and distress that you find (he) (she) has endured from the time of the injury until today
and that plaintiff is also entitled to be fairly and adequately compensated for all
physical pain, mental anguish, discomfort, inconvenience, and distress you find
(he) (she) will endure in the future as a result of (his) (her) injuries.
The second item that goes to make up noneconomic loss is embarrassment
and humiliation. Plaintiff is entitled to be fairly and adequately compensated for
such embarrassment and humiliation as you believe (he) (she) has endured and
will continue to endure in the future as a result of (his) (her) injuries.
The third item is loss of enjoyment of life. Plaintiff is entitled to be fairly
and adequately compensated for the loss of (his) (her) ability to enjoy any of the
pleasures of life as a result of the injuries from the time of the injuries until today
and to be fairly and adequately compensated for the loss of (his) (her) ability to
enjoy any of the pleasures of life in the future as a result of (his) (her) injuries.
The fourth and final item is disfigurement. The disfigurement that plaintiff
has sustained is a separate item of damages recognized by the law. Therefore, in
addition to any sums you award for pain and suffering, for embarrassment and
humiliation, and for loss of enjoyment of life, the plaintiff is entitled to be fairly
and adequately compensated for the disfigurement (he) (she) has suffered from
the time of the injury to the present and that (he) (she) will continue to suffer
during the future duration of (his) (her) life.
In considering plaintiff’s claims for damage awards for past and future noneconomic loss, you will consider the following factors: (1) the age of the plaintiff; (2) the severity of the injuries; (3) whether the injuries are temporary or permanent; (4) the extent to which the injuries affect the ability of the plaintiff to
perform basic activities of daily living and other activities in which the plaintiff
previously engaged; (5) the duration and nature of medical treatment; (6) the
duration and extent of the physical pain and mental anguish which the plaintiff
has experienced in the past and will experience in the future; (7) the health and
physical condition of the plaintiff prior to the injuries; and (8) in case of disfigurement, the nature of the disfigurement and the consequences for the plaintiff.
Official Note: These instructions may be modified by agreement of the parties or by the
court, based on circumstances of the case.

judge and to the opposing attorneys before the closing addresses to the jury are
begun. A requested point for charge that was presented to the trial judge becomes

requested point for charge.
Official Note: An appellate court will not review an objection to a ruling of a trial court
regarding a point for charge unless the point for charge was (1) presented to the court and (2)
made a part of the record by either reading the point into the record or filing it in the office of
the prothonotary prior to filing a motion for post-trial relief.
(b) At the close of all the evidence, the trial judge may direct a verdict upon

Rule 227.1. Post-Trial Relief.
(a) After trial and upon the written Motion for Post-Trial Relief filed by any
party, the court may
(1) order a new trial as to all or any of the issues; or
(2) direct the entry of judgment in favor of any party; or
(3) remove a nonsuit; or
(4) affirm, modify or change the decision; or
(5) enter any other appropriate order.
(b) Except as otherwise provided by Pa.R.E. 103(a), post-trial relief may not
be granted unless the grounds therefor,
(1) if then available, were raised in pre-trial proceedings or by motion,
objection, point for charge, request for findings of fact or conclusions of law,
offer of proof or other appropriate method at trial; and
(2) are specified in the motion. The motion shall state how the grounds
were asserted in pre-trial proceedings or at trial. Grounds not specified are
deemed waived unless leave is granted upon cause shown to specify additional
grounds.
(c) Post-trial motions shall be filed within ten days after
(1) verdict, discharge of the jury because of inability to agree, or nonsuit
in the case of a jury trial; or
(2) notice of nonsuit or the filing of the decision in the case of a trial without jury.
If a party has filed a timely post-trial motion, any other party may file a
post-trial motion within ten days after the filing of the first post-trial motion.
(d) A motion for post-trial relief shall specify the relief requested and may
request relief in the alternative. Separate reasons shall be set forth for each type
of relief sought.
(e) If a new trial and the entry of judgment are sought in the alternative, the
court shall dispose of both requests. If the court directs the entry of judgment, it
shall also rule on the request for a new trial by determining whether it should be
granted if the judgment is thereafter vacated or reversed, and shall specify the
grounds for granting or denying the request for a new trial.
(f) The party filing a post-trial motion shall serve a copy promptly upon
every other party to the action and deliver a copy to the trial judge.
(g) A motion for post-trial relief may not be filed in an appeal from the final
adjudication or determination of a local agency or a Commonwealth agency as to
which jurisdiction is vested in the courts of common pleas.
BUSINESS OF COURTS 231 Rule 227.1
200-23
(415449) No. 588 Nov. 23
(h) A motion for post-trial relief shall be filed following a trial upon an
appeal from the decision of viewers pursuant to the Eminent Domain Code.
(i) When an appellate court has remanded a case for further proceedings, a
motion for post-trial relief relating to subsequent rulings in the trial court shall
not be required unless
(1) the appellate court has specified that the remand is for a complete or
partial new trial, or
(2) the trial court indicates in its order resolving the remand issues that a
motion for post-trial relief is required pursuant to this rule.
Comment:
Subdivision (a). The motion for post-trial relief replaces the following motions and exceptions:
motion for new trial, motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, motion upon the whole record
after disagreement of a jury, motion in arrest of judgment, motion to remove a nonsuit and exceptions
following the decision of the judge in a trial without jury.
The following rules provide for the filing of exceptions, e.g., Rule 1534 (exceptions to a fiduciary’s account), Rule 1569 (exceptions to a hearing officer’s report in partition), Rule 1920.55-2 (exceptions to a hearing officer’s report in an action for divorce), Rule 1910.12(e) (exceptions to a hearing
officer’s report in an action for support), and Rule 3136(d) (exceptions to sheriff’s schedule of proposed distribution).
Subdivision (b) states two requirements for the granting of post-trial relief. First, the grounds for
the relief requested must have been raised in pre-trial proceedings or at trial and, second, they must
be stated in the motion. Under subdivision (b)(1), if no objection is made, error which could have
been corrected in pre-trial proceedings, i.e., a ground for a new trial or a judgment notwithstanding
the verdict, or during trial by timely objection, may not constitute a ground for post-trial relief. It must
be raised timely in pre-trial proceedings or during the trial, thus affording the court the opportunity
to correct the error.
Pa.R.E. 103(a) provides that the specific ground for an overruled objection, or the substance of
excluded evidence, need not be stated at or prior to trial, or without having made an offer of proof,
if the ground of the objection, or the substance of the evidence sought to be introduced, was apparent
from the context.
Under subdivision (b)(2), motions which set forth mere ‘‘boilerplate’’ language are specifically
disapproved. Rather, the motion must state ‘‘the specific grounds therefor.’’ A post-trial motion must
set forth the theories in support thereof ‘‘so that the lower court will know what it is being asked to
decide.’’ Frank v. Peckich, 391 A.2d 624, 632-633 (Pa. Super. 1978).
Subdivision (c). A motion for post-trial relief may be filed following a trial by jury or a trial by a
judge without a jury pursuant to Rule 1038. A motion for post-trial relief may not be filed to orders
disposing of preliminary objections, motions for judgment on the pleadings, motions for summary
judgment, or motions relating to discovery or other proceedings, which do not constitute a trial. See
U.S. National Bank in Johnstown v. Johnson, 487 A.2d 809 (Pa. 1985).
A motion for post-trial relief may not be filed to matters governed exclusively by the rules of petition practice.
The filing of a motion for post-trial relief is prohibited by the following rules: Rule 1557 (order
directing partition) and Rule 1930.2 (no post-trial practice in domestic relations matters).
Subdivision (g). See 2 Pa.C.S. § 101 for the definition of ‘‘local agency.’’
See 42 Pa.C.S. § 933(a)(1) providing for jurisdiction of appeals from determinations of particular
Commonwealth agencies to be in the courts of common pleas.
Subdivision (h). Any distinction with respect to the filing of a motion for post-trial relief between
jury and non-jury trials following an appeal from the decision of viewers in eminent domain proceedings is eliminated.

Historical Commentary
The following commentary is historical in nature and represents statements of the Committee at the
time of rulemaking:
EXPLANATORY COMMENT—1983
Introduction
The Judicial Code and the Judiciary Act Repealer Act (JARA) have repealed Acts of Assembly
which formed the basis for the entry of compulsory nonsuits and post-trial practice. The Code and
JARA contemplate that the subject matter of the repealed statutes shall be governed by general rules.
These amendments to the Rules of Civil Procedure supply the necessary procedure.
The amendments abolish the distinctions which have existed heretofore in post-trial practice. A
party who seeks post-trial relief will do so by filing a Motion for Post-Trial Relief irrespective of
whether the action is at law or in equity or whether the action is tried with or without a jury. New
Rules 227.1 to 227.4 inclusive apply to all such actions.
A detailed analysis of the changes in practice effected by the amendments follows each rule.
Conforming Amendments
In view of the new consolidated post-trial practice under Rule 227.1, a number of conforming
amendments are made to rules governing the actions in equity and for partition, the family law actions
of support and divorce and actions involving minors and incompetents.
The amendment to Rule 1557 governing partition reverses the current practice of filing exceptions
to an order directing partition. The amended rule specifically provides that exceptions to such an order
shall not be filed. Rather, relief may be sought through an appeal in accordance with Rule of Appellate Procedure 311(a)(6), as indicated in the note to Rule 1557.
The term ‘‘exceptions’’ is used in the rules in contexts other than post-trial practice. No amendment is made to rules using the term in such other contexts. Thus under Rule 227, a party need not
take ‘‘exception’’ to any ruling of the trial judge. A party must still file ‘‘exceptions’’ to an auditor’s
report under Rule 1530, a master’s report under Partition Rule 1569, a hearing officer’s report under
Support Rule 1910.12, a master’s report under Divorce Rule 1920.55 and a schedule of distribution
under Execution Rule 3136.
Rule 227.1
Rule 227.1 is entirely new. It includes several subjects not previously covered by the Rules of Civil
Procedure.
Subdivision (a) authorizes the court to grant post-trial relief upon motion. This provision is necessary because JARA has repealed the statutes which formerly provided that authorization. The rule
specifies the relief which may be granted and does not alter the prior practice.
Subdivision (a) prescribes the filing of a ‘‘written Motion for Post-Trial Relief’’. Motions for New
Trial, for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict, and for Judgment Upon the Whole Record will no
longer be filed following a trial by jury. Exceptions will no longer be filed following a trial by a judge
without a jury or an equity trial. The relief heretofore available through these motions and exceptions
remains available through the new Motion for Post-Trial Relief.
Subdivision (b) states two requirements for the granting of post-trial relief. First, the grounds for
the relief requested must have been raised in pre-trial proceedings or at trial and, second, they must
be stated in the motion.
Subdivision (b)(1) incorporates into the rule the principle of Dilliplaine v. Lehigh Valley Trust Co.,
457 Pa. 255, 322 A.2d 114 (1974), that basic and fundamental error is not a ground for a new trial
in the absence of a timely objection at the trial. The rule extends the principle to all post-trial relief.
A ground for a new trial or a judgment notwithstanding the verdict may not be raised for the first time
in the Motion for Post-Trial Relief. It must be raised timely in pre-trial proceedings or during the trial,
thus affording the court the opportunity to correct the error.
In Yudacufski v. Commonwealth, Department of Transportation, 499 Pa. 605, 454 A.2d 923 (1982),
the Supreme Court noted that the Rules of Civil Procedure governing post-trial practice ‘‘do not specifically include a requirement that pre-trial rulings must be raised in post-trial motions in order to be
preserved.’’ Subdivision (b) now contains such a provision.
BUSINESS OF COURTS 231 Rule 227.1
200-24.1
(415451) No. 588 Nov. 23
Subdivision (b)(2) specifies the requisites of the motion for post-trial relief. It must state the specific grounds for the relief sought and ‘‘how the grounds were asserted in pre-trial proceedings or at
trial.’’
In requiring the motion to state the specific grounds therefor, motions which set forth mere ‘‘boilerplate’’ language are specifically disapproved. A post-trial motion must set forth the theories in support thereof ‘‘so that the lower court will know what it is being asked to decide.’’ Frank v. Peckich,
257 Pa.Super. 561, 391 A.2d 624, 632-633 (1978).
The requirement that the motion state how the grounds were raised at trial indicates compliance
with the requirements of Dilliplaine, supra, and subdivision (b)(1) that there be a timely objection in
pre-trial proceedings or at the trial.
Under subdivision (c), the time for filing the post-trial motion remains unchanged at ten days.
However, the rule also provides an instance in which the time for filing a post-trial motion may be
extended beyond the initial ten day period. There are occasions when a party is displeased with the
result of a trial but refrains from filing a post-trial motion unless a post-trial motion is filed by an
opposing party. This strategy necessitates a close watch over the dockets, since the party will be foreclosed from filing a motion if the opposing party files its motion on the tenth day. To facilitate practice in this area, subdivision (c) provides that where a post-trial motion has been timely filed by one
party, any other party has ten days following the filing of the first post-trial motion in which to file
its own motion. As with the other provisions of Rule 227.1, this concept applies to jury, nonjury and
equity trials.
Subdivision (d) continues the practice of permitting a party to request post-trial relief in the alternative. When a party elects to so proceed, separate reasons should be set forth in support of each type
of relief requested. Again, the document should make the trial judge aware of each request for relief
and the grounds in support thereof.
Subdivision (e) provides a rule of judicial economy when both a new trial and judgment are sought
in an action. Subdivision (e) provides that the court shall dispose of both requests. Thereafter, if the
action is appealed, the appellate court may make a final disposition of the matter. This provision
avoids the procedural situation where a trial court grants judgment but fails to rule on the request for
a new trial. The action is thereafter appealed and the appellate court must then remand for disposition
of the request for new trial. Under subdivision (e), the appellate court would be able to remand the
matter directly for a new trial or affirm the ruling of the lower court.
New subdivision (f) provides for the prompt service of copies of the post-trial motion upon every
other party to the action and the delivery of a copy to the trial judge.
EXPLANATORY COMMENT—1985
The amendment of Rule 227.1(c)(2) to provide for the filing of a motion for post-trial relief within
ten days after nonsuit in a non-jury or an equity trial clarifies, but does not change, existing practice.
Although subdivision (c)(2) did not refer to the filing of a motion for post-trial relief after a nonsuit
in those instances, subdivision (a)(3) clearly provides for the court upon a written motion to remove
a nonsuit without reference to the nature of the trial. The addition of the reference to a nonsuit in subdivision (c)(2) removes any ambiguity that might arise with respect to the time in which a motion for
post-trial relief must be filed following a nonsuit in a non-jury or equity trial.
EXPLANATORY COMMENT—1989
The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has promulgated an amendment to Rule of Civil Procedure
227.1 governing post-trial relief clarifying practice under the rule in two respects. First, notes have
been added to subdivisions (a) and (c) explaining the scope of the motion for post-trial relief and the
range of actions and proceedings to which the motion applies. The text of these subdivisions is not
changed so that practice and procedure under them remain unaffected.
Second, new subdivision (g) is added to the rule specifying the procedure in appeals from final
determinations of certain government agencies. The Commonwealth Court has stated that there are no
post-trial proceedings in ‘‘statutory appeal’’ proceedings unless mandated by local rule. This practice
has caused confusion in several respects. In many cases, post-trial motions have been filed unneces231 Rule 227.1 GENERAL
200-24.2
(415452) No. 588 Nov. 23 Copyright  2023 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
sarily and have resulted in the loss of the right to appeal. In other cases, attorneys have filed motions
for post-trial relief and appeals simultaneously because they were unable to discern the proper procedure.
New subdivision (g) prohibits post-trial proceedings in a statutory appeal. The decision of the court
in all such cases will be a final, appealable order.
EXPLANATORY COMMENT—1995
Amendments to the Rules of Civil Procedure relating to post-trial practice have been promulgated,
allowing parties to minimize post-trial delay and clarifying the procedure with regard to proceedings
in eminent domain and the actions of mandamus and partition of real property.
I. Entry of Judgment upon Praecipe
a. Post-Trial Delay
Prior to the present amendment, parties to an action had no recourse when a motion for post-trial
relief remained pending and undecided. The amendment to Rule 227.4 permits any party to an action
to file a praecipe for judgment when a timely motion has been filed and remains undecided for more
than one hundred twenty days after filing.
The rule is optional with the parties. If settlement negotiations are continuing, they may have little
interest in a prompt appeal. If time is not of the essence, they may await the decision of the trial court.
However, the rule provides the parties with the ability to ‘‘move the case along.’’
If a motion remains undecided and a praecipe for judgment is entered at the earliest permissible
time, the maximum post-trial delay is one hundred thirty days, i.e., ten days in which to file the
motion and one hundred twenty days in which to decide it. The potential delay inherent in Rule of
Appellate Procedure 1701(b)(3) providing for reconsideration of an order is avoided by prohibiting
reconsideration of the judgment. The judgment entered is effective as to all parties and all issues so
that the case in its entirety is ready for the appellate process.
The rule does not provide an automatic limit upon the time in which the court may make its ruling.
However, it does provide a time standard by which the parties and the court may proceed.
There is a rule which may operate to prevent the entry of judgment upon the expiration of the one
hundred twenty day period. Rule 238(c)(3)(i) provides that if ‘‘a motion for post-trial relief has been
filed under Rule 227.1 and a motion for delay damages is opposed, a judgment may not be entered
until all motions filed under Rule 227.1 and this rule [Rule 238] have been decided.’’ A note has been
added to call attention to the rule.
b. Waiver of Post-Trial Practice
A second amendment to Rule 227.4 has deleted the provision for entry of judgment upon filing a
‘‘waiver in writing of the right to file post-trial motions signed by all parties’’. Present Pennsylvania
policy is to require the parties to give the trial court the opportunity to correct error through post-trial
practice. It follows that post-trial practice should not be subject to waiver.
II. Eminent Domain
Case law had developed an inconsistent practice with respect to the filing of a post-trial motion
following trial upon an appeal from the decision of viewers in eminent domain proceedings. Post-trial
practice was required following a trial by jury but not after a trial by a judge without a jury. New
subdivision (h) has been added to Rule 227.1 eliminating this distinction and requiring post-trial
practice whether the trial be by jury or by judge.
EXPLANATORY COMMENT—1996
The note to Rule 227.1(c) has been amended by deleting the second paragraph referring to a case
stated. This amendment was required by the abolition of the case stated by Rule 1038.2.
The amendment is technical in nature and does not affect practice or procedure.
EXPLANATORY COMMENT—2004
Prior to the present amendment, Rule of Civil Procedure 227.1(b) was inconsistent with Pennsylvania Rule of Evidence 103(a). Civil Rule 227.1(b) required without exception that grounds for posttrial relief be raised in pre-trial proceedings or at trial. Evidence Rule 103(a), however, did not require
that the specific ground for an erroneous evidentiary ruling be raised prior to or at trial if the ground
BUSINESS OF COURTS 231 Rule 227.1
200-24.3
(415453) No. 588 Nov. 23
was apparent from the context. The present amendment to Civil Rule 227.1 carves out an exception
for matters within the scope of Evidence Rule 103(a), thereby eliminating the inconsistency between
the two rules.
EXPLANATORY COMMENT—2015
In Newman Development Group of Pottstown, LLC v. Genuardi’s Family Markets, Inc. and Safeway, Inc., 52 A.3d 1233 (Pa. 2012), the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania examined the provisions of
Rule 227.1 to determine whether a party must file a motion for post-trial relief following the resolution by the trial court of matters remanded by an appellate court. While it concluded in that case that
a motion for post-trial relief was not required because the remand proceeding, which relied on an
existing record, was not a trial, even though the trial court drew a different conclusion from that
record to comport with the appellate court’s directive, the Court held that Rule 227.1 is silent as to
any procedure for post-trial relief when a matter has been remanded for further consideration by the
trial court. Id. at 1251.
To close this gap, the Supreme Court has amended Rule 227.1 by adding new subdivision (i). Specifically addressing the remand context, the amendment would not require the filing of a motion for
post-trial relief following the resolution of matters remanded by an appellate court except under the
following circumstances: (1) the appellate court has specified that the remand is for a complete or
partial new trial, or (2) the trial court states in its order resolving the issue remanded that a motion
for post-trial relief is required in order to preserve those issues for appellate review.
The amendment is intended to give the practitioner certainty as to when a motion for post-trial
relief is required in the remand context, and thus, to prevent waiver of those issues upon further
appellate review. It is also intended to facilitate the underlying purpose of the rule, which is to allow
the trial court to reconsider its determination and to make any corrections before it is appealed without inundating it with unnecessary motions.

Rule 227.4. Entry of Judgment upon Praecipe of a Party.
In addition to the provisions of any Rule of Civil Procedure or Act of Assembly authorizing the prothonotary to enter judgment upon praecipe of a party and
except as otherwise provided by Rule 1042.72(e)(3), the prothonotary shall, upon
praecipe of a party:
(1) enter judgment upon a nonsuit by the court, the verdict of a jury or the
decision of a judge following a trial without jury, if
(a) no timely post-trial motion is filed; or
(b) one or more timely post-trial motions are filed and the court does
not enter an order disposing of all motions within one hundred twenty days
after the filing of the first motion. A judgment entered pursuant to this subparagraph shall be final as to all parties and all issues and shall not be subject to reconsideration;
Official Note: If a motion for delay damages has been filed, judgment may not be entered
until that motion is decided or otherwise resolved. See Rule 238(c)(3)(i).
Rule 1042.72(e)(3) prohibits the entry of judgment in a medical professional liability action
if a motion for post-trial relief under Rule 227.1 is pending with respect to the ground that a
damage award for noneconomic loss is excessive.
(2) enter judgment when a court grants or denies relief but does not itself
enter judgment or order the prothonotary to do so.
Official Note: See Rule 236 requiring the prothonotary to give notice of the entry of an
order or judgment and Rule 237 requiring notice of filing of praecipe for judgment. For illustrative Rules of Civil Procedure specifically authorizing entry of judgment by the prothonotary

of all parties or leave of court upon motion of any plaintiff or any defendant for
whom plaintiff has stipulated in writing to the discontinuance.
(2) In an action governed by Rule 1042.3, a plaintiff may enter a discontinuance as to a defendant if a certificate of merit as to that defendant has not

Rule 229.1. Settlement Funds. Failure to Deliver. Sanctions.
(a) As used in this rule,
‘‘defendant’’ means a party released from a claim of liability pursuant to an
agreement of settlement;
‘‘plaintiff’’ means a party who, by execution of a release pursuant to an
agreement of settlement, has agreed to forego a claim of liability against a
defendant. The term includes a defendant who asserts a counterclaim;
‘‘settlement funds’’ means any form of monetary exchange to a plaintiff pursuant to an agreement of settlement, but not including the annuity or future
installment portion of a structured settlement.
(b) The parties may agree in writing to modify or waive any of the provisions
of this rule.
(c) If a plaintiff and a defendant have entered into an agreement of settlement, the defendant shall deliver the settlement funds to the attorney for the
plaintiff, or to the plaintiff if unrepresented, within twenty calendar days from
receipt of an executed release.
Official Note: If court approval of the settlement is required, Rule 229.1 is not operative
until the settlement is so approved.
Upon receipt of the settlement funds, the plaintiff shall file a discontinuance or deliver a discontinuance to the defendant.
(d) If settlement funds are not delivered to the plaintiff within the time
required by subdivision (c), the plaintiff may seek to
(1) invalidate the agreement of settlement as permitted by law, or

(2) impose sanctions on the defendant as provided in subdivision (e) of this
rule.
(e) A plaintiff seeking to impose sanctions on the defendant shall file an affidavit with the court attesting to non-payment. The affidavit shall be executed by
the plaintiff’s attorney and be accompanied by
(1) a copy of any document evidencing the terms of the settlement agreement,
(2) a copy of the executed release,
(3) a copy of a receipt reflecting delivery of the executed release more than
twenty days prior to the date of filing of the affidavit,
(4) a certification by the attorney of the applicable interest rate,
(5) the form of order prescribed by subdivision (h), and
(6) a certification by the attorney that the affidavit and accompanying
documents have been served on the attorneys for all interested parties.
(f) Upon receipt of the affidavit and supporting documentation required by
subdivision (e), the defendant shall have twenty days to file a response.
(g) If the court finds that the defendant violated subdivision (c) of this rule
and that there is no material dispute as to the terms of the settlement or the terms
of the release, the court shall impose sanctions in the form of interest calculated
at the rate equal to the prime rate as listed in the first edition of the Wall Street
Journal published for each calendar year for which the interest is awarded, plus
one percent, not compounded, running from the twenty-first day to the date of
delivery of the settlement funds, together with reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred
in the preparation of the affidavit.
(h) The affidavit shall be accompanied by an order in substantially the following form:

Rule 229.2. Petition to Transfer Structured Settlement Payment Rights.
(a) Words used in this rule, which are defined by the Structured Settlement
Protection Act, shall have the meaning set forth in the Act.
Official Note: See Section 2 of the Act, 40 P. S. § 4002, which defines numerous terms
including ‘‘best interests,’’ ‘‘dependents,’’ ‘‘payee,’’ ‘‘structured settlement obligor,’’ and ‘‘structured settlement payment rights.’’
(b) A petition to transfer structured settlement payment rights shall be filed
in the county in which the payee is domiciled.
Official Note: See Section 4 of the Act, 40 P. S. § 4004, providing that the court of common pleas of the judicial district in which the payee is domiciled shall have jurisdiction over the
petition.
(c) The parties to the petition shall be the payee and the transferee.
(d) The petition shall be verified by the transferee and shall contain:
(1) a statement setting forth the payment provisions of the structured settlement agreement and the payment rights that the payee seeks to transfer,
(2) separate paragraphs which in bold type set forth
(i) the net amount payable to the payee after deduction of all commissions, fees, costs, expenses, and charges, and
(ii) the following statement setting forth the interest rate:
‘‘Based on the net amount that the payee will receive from this transaction
($ ) and the amounts and timing of the structured settlement
payments that would be assigned, the payee is, in effect, paying interest at a
rate of % per year.’’
(3) four attachments:
(i) a Payee’s Affidavit in Support of Petition, in the form prescribed by
subdivision (f) as Attachment 1,
(ii) an initial order of court scheduling the hearing, in the form prescribed by subdivision (g),
(iii) a certification by an attorney for the transferee representing to the
best of his or her knowledge, information and belief, formed after reasonable
inquiry, that the transfer will comply with the requirements of the Act and
will not contravene any other applicable federal or state statute or regulation
or the order of any court or administrative authority, and
(iv) a final order of court granting the petition, in the form prescribed by
subdivision (i).
Official Note: These four attachments are in addition to any other documents which are
required to support the findings set forth in Section 3 of the Act, 40 P. S. § 4003.
Subdivision (d) requires that two documents be verified. As the two documents contain different information, each must be verified by a different person. The petition to transfer structured settlement payment rights must be verified by the transferee. The Payee’s Affidavit in
Support of Petition must be verified by the payee. The transferee is not required to verify the
information set forth in the Payee’s Affidavit.
(e)(1) If the petition and Payee’s Affidavit in Support of Petition meet the
requirements of this rule and contain factual allegations which, if established, will

support the findings set forth in Section 3 of the Act, the court shall promptly
enter an order scheduling a hearing date. The transferee shall give notice of the
hearing, in the form prescribed by subdivision (h), to the payee, the structured
settlement obligor, the annuity issuer, the payee’s spouse and any person who
receives child support, alimony or alimony pendente lite from the payee.
(2) If the petition is denied without a hearing for failure to meet the
requirements of this rule or to contain necessary factual allegations, which will
support the findings set forth in Section 3 of the Act, the court shall state reasons for the denial and the payee may file an amended petition as of course.

Comment:
This rule provides an administrative method for the termination of inactive cases.
Subdivision (b). If the notice mailed to an attorney is returned by the postal service, the prothonotary should check the website of the Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania,
www.padisciplinaryboard.org, for a current address.
Subdivision (c). The prothonotary may not enter an order terminating the action until more than 30
days after service of the notice of proposed termination. A court officer may certify to the prothonotary those matters which have been inactive and in which no statement of intention to proceed has
been filed.
Subdivision (d). The provision under subdivision (d)(2) for filing a petition within 60 days of the
entry of the order of termination on the docket is not a standard of timeliness. Rather, the filing of the
petition during that time period eliminates the need to make the showing otherwise required by subdivision (d)(3). In addition, the standard in subdivision (d)(2) is not intended to set a standard for
timeliness in proceedings outside this rule.
Historical Commentary
The following commentary is historical in nature and represents statements of the Committee at the
time of rulemaking:
EXPLANATORY COMMENT—2003
The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has promulgated new Rule of Civil Procedure 230.2 governing the termination of inactive cases and amended Rule of Judicial Administration 1901. Two aspects
of the recommendation merit comment.
I. Rule of Civil Procedure
New Rule of Civil Procedure 230.2 has been promulgated to govern the termination of inactive
cases within the scope of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure. The termination of these cases
for inactivity was previously governed by Rule of Judicial Administration 1901 and local rules promulgated pursuant to it. New Rule 230.2 is tailored to the needs of civil actions. It provides a complete procedure and a uniform statewide practice, preempting local rules.
This rule was promulgated in response to the decision of the Supreme Court in Shope v. Eagle, 551
Pa. 360, 710 A.2d 1104 (1998) in which the court held that ‘‘prejudice to the defendant as a result of
delay in prosecution is required before a case may be dismissed pursuant to local rules implementing
Rule of Judicial Administration 1901.’’
Rule of Judicial Administration 1901(b) has been amended to accommodate the new rule of civil
procedure. The general policy of the prompt disposition of matters set forth in subdivision (a) of that
rule continues to be applicable.
II. Inactive Cases
The purpose of Rule 230.2 is to eliminate inactive cases from the judicial system. The process is
initiated by the court. After giving notice of intent to terminate an action for inactivity, the course of
the procedure is with the parties. If the parties do not wish to pursue the case, they will take no action
and ‘‘the prothonotary shall enter an order as of course terminating the matter with prejudice for failure to prosecute.’’ If a party wishes to pursue the matter, he or she will file a notice of intention to
proceed and the action shall continue.
231 Rule 230.2 GENERAL
200-30.2
(415460) No. 588 Nov. 23 Copyright  2023 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
a. Where the action has been terminated
If the action is terminated when a party believes that it should not have been terminated, that party
may proceed under Rule 230(d) for relief from the order of termination. An example of such an
occurrence might be the termination of a viable action when the aggrieved party did not receive the
notice of intent to terminate and thus did not timely file the notice of intention to proceed.
The timing of the filing of the petition to reinstate the action is important. If the petition is filed
within thirty days of the entry of the order of termination on the docket, subdivision (d)(2) provides
that the court must grant the petition and reinstate the action. If the petition is filed later than the
thirty-day period, subdivision (d)(3) requires that the plaintiff must make a showing to the court that
the petition was promptly filed and that there is a reasonable explanation or legitimate excuse both
for the failure to file the notice of intention to proceed prior to the entry of the order of termination
on the docket and for the failure to file the petition within the thirty-day period under subdivision
(d)(2).
b. Where the action has not been terminated
An action which has not been terminated but which continues upon the filing of a notice of intention to proceed may have been the subject of inordinate delay. In such an instance, the aggrieved party
may pursue the remedy of a common law non pros which exists independently of termination under
Rule 230.2.
EXPLANATORY COMMENT—2015
In 2014, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania made efforts to reduce the inventory of civil cases on
the dockets of the Courts of Common Pleas. To expedite that process, it suspended Rule 230.2 governing the termination of inactive cases. Originally adopted in 2003, Rule 230.2 implemented the
general policy provisions of Rule of Judicial Administration 1901(a) governing the prompt disposition of matters and the termination of inactive cases. While Pa.R.J.A. No. 1901(a) provided general
guidelines for conducting an administrative purge, Rule 230.2 set forth a procedural mechanism for
a court to perform an administrative purge of cases that had remained on the civil docket for two or
more years with no evidence of any activity.
The Court has amended and reinstated Rule 230.2. The amendments have streamlined the procedure for the trial court to conduct an administrative purge of inactive cases, and are intended to ensure
that the civil dockets reflect the current inventory of active cases, while encouraging attorneys to
expeditiously litigate their cases.
Several concerns with the suspended Rule 230.2 were identified. The suspended rule did not
specify how often a court should conduct an administrative purge; it only provided a procedure should
a court decide to conduct an administrative purge. In order to ensure that the civil case inventory is
accurate, the amendment of subdivision (a) requires a court to conduct an administrative purge at least
once a year. The court is also required to report such information to the Court Administrator of Pennsylvania with a form supplied by the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts.
A second problem identified with suspended Rule 230.2 was the provision for service of the notice
of proposed termination in subdivision (b). In subdivision (b)(1), the suspended rule required service
of the notice of proposed termination on counsel of record or unrepresented parties at least sixty days
prior to the date of termination. To expedite the process, the amendment of subdivision (b)(1) shortens that time frame and require the notice to be served to at least thirty days prior to the date of termination.
The suspended rule did not provide for modern, efficient methods for giving notice to counsel or
unrepresented parties that cases were identified as having no activity on the docket for the previous
two years. Subdivision (b)(2) of the suspended rule provided for the notice to be served by mail pursuant to Rule 440 at the last address of record. In the event that the notice was returned, publication
was required in the legal publication designated by the court for such notices. In conjunction with the
BUSINESS OF COURTS 231 Rule 230.2
200-30.3
(415461) No. 588 Nov. 23
shortened time frame in subdivision (b)(1), the amendment of subdivision (b)(2) updates the method
for giving notice by allowing the notice to be served electronically pursuant to Rule 205.4 governing
electronic filing. The ability to serve notice by mail pursuant to Rule 440 has been retained, but publication in the legal journal when a notice has been returned has been eliminated.
A third problem identified with suspended Rule 230.2 was the filing of statements of intention to
proceed in order to keep a case active, but then not requiring any further obligation on counsel or an
unrepresented party to move the case forward to resolution. Subdivision (c) of the suspended rule
required an attorney or unrepresented party to file a statement of intention to proceed before the termination date stated in the notice in order to prevent the purging of the case from the docket. If no
statement of intention to proceed was filed, the prothonotary was directed to enter an order terminating the matter for failure to prosecute. In the newly amended rule, this provision has been retained.
However, new subdivision (h) encourages the trial court to manage its cases by scheduling a status
conference and establishing appropriate timelines to insure a timely and efficient disposition of the
case.
Importantly, the amendment of Rule 230.2 retains the post-termination procedure set forth in subdivision (d) of the suspended rule, which allows a party to petition the court to reinstate the action.
The suspended rule provided certain requirements for reinstatement depending whether the petition is
filed within thirty days or beyond thirty days. While the requirements remain unchanged, subdivision
(d) has been amended to provide for sixty days rather than thirty days. New subdivision (e), however,
limits reinstatements of a case. If any case, previously reinstated, is terminated pursuant to this rule,
then it is terminated with prejudice. No additional reinstatements will be granted. This provision is
intended to encourage the efficient litigation of cases and to not let them languish on the docket.

Rule 234.1. Subpoena to Attend and Testify.
(a) A subpoena is an order of the court commanding a person to attend and

court.
(c) A subpoena may not be used to compel a person to appear or to produce
documents or things ex parte before an attorney, a party or a representative of the
party.

documents.
(c) Failure to give the notice or when a judgment by confession is entered to

notice of other matters by facsimile transmission or other electronic means if the
party to whom the notice is to be given or the party’s attorney has filed a written
request for such method of notification or has included a facsimile or other electronic address on a prior legal paper filed in the action.

by confession, Rule 236 does not prescribe a particular method of giving notice. Methods of
notice properly used by the prothonotary include, but are not limited to, service via United States
mail and courthouse mail. Subdivision (d) governs facsimile transmission and other electronic
means if the prothonotary chooses to use such a method.
A facsimile or other electronic address set forth on letterhead is not a sufficient basis under
this rule to authorize the prothonotary to give notice electronically.
Notice by facsimile transmission or other electronic means is applicable not only to orders
and judgments under subdivision (a) but also to ‘‘other matters’’ such as the scheduling of a
conference, hearing or trial or other administrative matters. Where the technology involved provides an acknowledgment for the mailing or the receipt of the notice, the prothonotary should
retain that acknowledgment as part of his or her file.

facsimile transmission.

Rule 237.1. Notice of Praecipe for Entry of Judgment of Non Pros for
Failure to File Complaint or by Default for Failure to Plead.
(a) As used in this rule,
‘‘judgment of non pros’’ means a judgment entered by praecipe pursuant to
Rules 1037(a) and 1659;
Official Note: When a defendant appeals from a judgment entered in a magisterial district
court, Pa.R.C.P.M.D.J. 1004(b) authorizes the appellant to file a praecipe for a rule as of course
upon the appellee to file a complaint or suffer entry of a judgment of non pros. The entry of the
judgment of non pros is governed by Pa.R.C.P. No. 1037(a) and is subject to this rule.
‘‘judgment by default’’ means a judgment entered by praecipe pursuant to
Rules 1037(b), 1511(a), 3031(a) and 3146(a).
(2) No judgment of non pros for failure to file a complaint or by default
for failure to plead shall be entered by the prothonotary unless the praecipe for
entry includes a certification that a written notice of intention to file the praecipe was mailed or delivered:
(i) in the case of a judgment of non pros, after the failure to file a complaint and at least ten days prior to the date of the filing of the praecipe to
the party’s attorney of record or to the party if unrepresented, or
(ii) in the case of a judgment by default, after the failure to plead to a
complaint and at least ten days prior to the date of the filing of the praecipe
to the party against whom judgment is to be entered and to the party’s attorney of record, if any.
The ten-day notice period in subdivision (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(ii) shall be calculated forward from the date of the mailing or delivery, in accordance with
Pa.R.J.A. 107.
Official Note: The final sentence of Rule 237.1(a)(2) alters the practice described in the
decision of Williams v. Wade, 704 A.2d 132 (Pa. Super. 1997).
(3) A copy of the notice shall be attached to the praecipe.
(4) The notice and certification required by this rule may not be waived.
Official Note: A certification of notice is a prerequisite in all cases to the entry by praecipe
of a judgment of non pros for failure to file a complaint or by default for failure to plead to a
complaint. Once the ten-day notice has been given, no further notice is required by the rule even
if the time to file the complaint or to plead to the complaint has been extended by agreement.
See Rule 237.4 for the form of the notice of intention to enter a judgment of non pros and
Rule 237.5 for the form of the notice of intention to enter a judgment by default.
(b) This rule does not apply to a judgment entered
(1) by an order of court,
(2) upon praecipe pursuant to an order of court, or
(3) pursuant to a rule to show cause.
Official Note: See Rule 3284 which requires that in proceedings to fix fair market value of

complaint, an answer or preliminary objections. The agreement shall be in the
form prescribed by Rule 237.6 and shall be signed on behalf of both parties. If

grounds for relief shall be raised in a single petition.

(2) If the petition is filed within ten days after the entry of a default judgment on the docket, the court shall open the judgment if one or more of the
proposed preliminary objections has merit or the proposed answer states a
meritorious defense.
Official Note: Rule 236 requires the prothonotary to give notice of the entry of any judgment and to note in the docket the giving of the notice.
The petitioner must act with reasonable diligence to see that the petition is promptly presented to the court if required by local practice.
See Schultz v. Erie Insurance Exchange, 477 A.2d 471 (Pa. 1984) for the requirements for
opening a judgment by default and Rule 3051 as to a judgment of non pros. Rule 237.3 does
not change the law of opening judgments. Rather, the rule supplies two of the three requisites
for opening such judgments by presupposing that a petition filed as provided by the rule is
timely and with reasonable explanation or legitimate excuse for the inactivity or delay resulting
in the entry of the judgment. The requirement of this rule for proceeding within ten days is not
intended to set a standard for timeliness in circumstances outside this rule.
See Rules 206.1 through 206.7 governing petition practice.
Explanatory Comment—1994
Rule 237.3 governs relief from a judgment by default or of non pros. Subdivision (a) requires that
a copy of the complaint, preliminary objections, or answer sought to be filed be attached to the petition for relief from the judgment. This enables the court to determine from the actual complaint, preliminary objections, or answer to be filed whether the complaint alleges a meritorious cause of action,
one or more of the preliminary objections has merit, or the answer alleges a meritorious defense.
Subdivision (b) eases the burden of a party against whom judgment has been entered and who

ment of non pros within ten days after entry of the judgment on the docket, the rule requires the court
to open the judgment if the proposed complaint states a meritorious cause of action. If the petitioner
files a petition for relief from a default judgment within ten days after entry of the judgment on the
docket, the rule requires the court to open the judgment if one or more of the proposed preliminary
objections has merit or the proposed answer states a meritorious defense. The rule provides a date
certain from which to measure the ten-day period and the language establishing the beginning of that
period is derived from Rule 1308 governing appeals in compulsory arbitration.
Case law has imposed three requirements for opening a judgment by default: a petition timely filed,
a reasonable explanation or legitimate excuse for the inactivity or delay and a showing of a meritorious defense. Rule of Civil Procedure 3051 similarly states these three requisites for opening a judgment of non pros, substituting the showing of a meritorious cause of action rather than a meritorious
defense. Rule 237.3(b) presumes that a petition filed within the required ten-day period is both timely
and with reasonable explanation or legitimate excuse for the inactivity or delay. In this context, subdivision (b) requires that the judgment be opened if the petitioner attaches to the petition a complaint
which states a meritorious cause of action, one or more preliminary objections which has merit, or an
answer which states a meritorious defense. A note to the rule cautions that the rule is not intended to
change the law relating to the opening of judgments in any way or to impose a new standard of timeliness in cases outside the limited circumstances set forth in the rule.moves promptly for relief from
that judgment. If the petitioner files a petition for relief from a judge
Illustrations
In illustrations 1 through 3, the defendant has failed to plead within the required time to a complaint containing a notice to plead.
1. Prior to receiving a notice of intention to enter a default judgment, defendant seeks an agreement with the plaintiff for an extension of time in which to plead. The parties may certainly agree to
an extension of time and proceed in accordance with their agreement. However, such an agreement is
really unnecessary since the plaintiff cannot enter judgment without giving the ten-day notice required
by the rule and the ten-day notice cannot be waived. Defendant may plead within the time up to the
date of mailing or delivery of the notice plus ten days. This period of time may be more than might
be provided by any agreement. In addition, there is no danger of a judgment being entered as the
required notice has not been given.
2. Defendant has received the ten-day notice but cannot file the pleading within the ten-day period.
Now, as provided by Rule 237.2, it is appropriate to seek an agreement to extend the time in which
to plead since the plaintiff has given the notice which is prerequisite to the entry of judgment and
actual entry of the judgment is imminent.
3. Defendant has received the ten-day notice and obtained an agreement extending the time to
plead. However, defendant does not plead within the agreed time. Plaintiff may enter judgment by
default without further notice as provided by Rule 237.2 and the form of agreement set forth in Rule
237.6.
In illustrations 4 and 5, the plaintiff has entered a valid judgment by default against the defendant
and the prothonotary has entered the judgment in the docket and noted the date thereof. Thereafter,
the defendant files a petition to open the judgment.
4. The defendant files the petition to open the judgment within ten days of the date on which the
prothonotary entered the judgment on the docket and seeks leave to file the answer attached to the
petition. The defendant is entitled to the benefit of Rule 237.3(b)(2) by timely filing the petition and
attaching an answer. Rule 237.3(b)(2) requires the court to open the judgment upon the defendant
demonstrating to the court that the filing of the petition was within the ten-day period and that the
answer attached to the petition states a meritorious defense.
5. The defendant files a petition to open the judgment more than ten days after the date of entry
of the judgment on the docket. The petition to open is not within the scope of Rule 237.3(b) which
requires that the petition be ‘‘filed within ten days after the entry of the judgment on the docket’’.
The defendant must proceed pursuant to case law and meet the standards of Schultz v. Erie Insurance
Exchange, 477 A.2d 471 (Pa. 1984).
Although these illustrations use the example of the entry of a judgment by default and a petition
to open the judgment, they are adaptable and thus equally applicable to the entry of a judgment of
non pros for failure to file a complaint and a petition to open such a judgment.

Explanatory Comment—2010
The 1994 Explanatory Comment to Rule 237.3 provides several illustrations of the application of
the rule. A discrepancy exists between Illustration 1 and Rule 237.1(a)(2)(ii) governing notice of
praecipe to enter judgment of non pros or by default. The 1994 Explanatory Comment provides that
the defendant may plead within the time of receiving the notice of praecipe plus ten days. Rule
237.1(a)(2)(ii) states that the ten-day period shall be calculated forward from the date of the mailing
or delivery of the notice. The 1994 Explanatory Comment has been amended to conform with the text
of Rule 237.1(a)(2)(ii).
Explanatory Comment—2019
In 2016, Rule 237.3 was amended by adding preliminary objections as a type of pleading that may
be attached to a petition for relief from a default judgment. By allowing the use of preliminary objections, the 2016 amendment was intended to give a defendant the same right to file a responsive
pleading after the entry of a default judgment that is afforded to him or her prior to entry of a default
judgment. In practice, however, litigants have interpreted this provision to permit the filing of a petition for relief with proposed preliminary objections attached, and then, when that petition is denied,
to then file an additional petition for relief by attaching the proposed answer, notwithstanding the
requirement that a petition for relief must be filed within 10 days of the entry of a default judgment.
To promote procedural efficiency, Rule 237.3 has been amended to require a litigant to raise all
grounds for relief in a single petition.

Rule 238. Damages for Delay in an Action for Bodily Injury, Death or
Property Damage.
(a)(1) At the request of the plaintiff in a civil action seeking monetary relief
for bodily injury, death or property damage, damages for delay shall be added to
the amount of compensatory damages awarded against each defendant or additional defendant found to be liable to the plaintiff in the verdict of a jury, in the
decision of the court in a nonjury trial or in the award of arbitrators appointed
under section 7361 of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. § 7361, and shall become
part of the verdict, decision or award.
(2) Damages for delay shall be awarded for the period of time from a date
one year after the date original process was first served in the action up to the
date of the award, verdict or decision.
(3) Damages for delay shall be calculated at the rate equal to the prime rate
as listed in the first edition of the Wall Street Journal published for each calendar year for which the damages are awarded, plus one percent, not compounded.
(b)(1) The period of time for which damages for delay shall be calculated
under subdivision (a)(2) shall exclude the period of time, if any,
(i) after the defendant made a written offer which complied with the
requirements of subdivision (b)(2), provided that the plaintiff obtained a
recovery which did not exceed the amount described in subdivision (b)(3), or
(ii) during which the plaintiff caused delay of the trial.
Official Note: This rule does not preclude the suspension of damages for delay as a pretrial sanction under Discovery Rule 4019.
Rule 238
200-37
(377621) No. 490 Sep. 15
In additional defendant proceedings, the additional defendant will be considered the defendant, for purposes of this subdivision, and the plaintiff will be considered either the original
defendant if liability over is claimed, or the original plaintiff if direct liability is claimed, or both
if both forms of liability are claimed.
(2) The written offer of settlement required by subdivision (b)(1)(i) shall
contain an express clause continuing the offer in effect for at least ninety days
or until commencement of trial, whichever occurs first, and shall either
(i) be in a specified sum with prompt cash payment, or
(ii) contain a structured settlement plus any cash payment. An offer that
includes a structured settlement shall disclose the terms of payment underwritten by a financially responsible entity, the identity of the underwriter and
the cost.
Official Note: The offer of the cost of the structured settlement and any cash payment must
remain open for ninety days. The cost of the entire structured settlement must remain the same
while the terms of the payment may vary and have to be recalculated at the time of acceptance
due to market fluctuation over the ninety-day period during which the offer must remain open.
(3) The plaintiff’s recovery required by subdivision (b)(1)(i), whether by
award, verdict or decision, exclusive of damages for delay, shall not be more
than 125 percent of either the specified sum or the cost of the structured settlement plus any cash payment to the plaintiff.
(c) Not later than ten days after the verdict or notice of the decision, the
plaintiff may file a written motion requesting damages for delay and setting forth
the computation. The motion shall begin with the following notice:
NOTICE
You are hereby notified to file a written answer to the attached
motion for delay damages within twenty days from the filing of the
motion or the delay damages sought in the motion may be added to
the verdict or decision against you.
(1) Within twenty days after the motion is filed, the defendant may answer
specifying the grounds for opposing the plaintiff’s motion. The averments of
the answer shall be deemed denied. If an issue of fact is raised, the court may,
in its discretion, hold a hearing before entering an appropriate order.
Official Note: An order of the court on the motion for delay damages shall not be subject
to a motion for post-trial relief.
(2) If the defendant does not file an answer and oppose the motion, the
prothonotary upon praecipe shall add the damages for delay to the verdict or
decision in the amount set forth in the motion.
(3)(i) If a motion for post-trial relief has been filed under Rule 227.1 and
a motion for delay damages is pending, a judgment may not be entered until
disposition has been made of all motions filed under Rule 227.1 and this rule.
(ii) If no motion for post-trial relief is filed within the ten-day period
under Rule 227.1 but the defendant opposes the motion for delay damages,
the plaintiff may enter judgment on the verdict or decision. Thereafter, upon
deciding the motion for damages for delay, the court shall enter judgment for
the amount of the delay damages, if any.
Rule 238
200-38
(377622) No. 490 Sep. 15 Copyright  2015 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
(d)(1) In an action heard by a board of arbitrators on which damages for
delay are requested, at least twenty days prior to the hearing the plaintiff shall
notify the defendant of the intention to request delay damages and the date from
which they are to be calculated. A defendant who objects to the request shall submit to the plaintiff within ten days prior to the hearing a statement setting forth
the objections and whether
(i) the defendant made an offer in writing and, if so, the amount and
the date of the offer; and
(ii) there was a period of time during which delay of the arbitration
hearing was attributable to the plaintiff. Each party shall submit to the board
at the hearing a sealed envelope containing the plaintiff’s request and the
defendant’s statement. Immediately upon making an award, the board of
arbitrators shall review the contents of the envelopes and add damages for
delay, if any, to the award. If the defendant opposes the request, the board
may hold a hearing on the issue of damages for delay and shall immediately
thereafter determine the amount of damages for delay, if any. Damages for
delay shall be separately stated in the report and award of the arbitrators.
Official Note: This rule contemplates that the board of arbitrators will make its award
immediately upon conclusion of the hearing and that it will then proceed to consider the issue
of damages for delay.
(2) The damages for delay shall not be included in determining whether the
amount in controversy is within the jurisdiction of the arbitrators.
(e) This rule shall not apply to
(1) eminent domain proceedings;
Official Note: See Article VI, section 611 of the Eminent Domain Code of 1964, Special
Session, June 23, P.L. 84, 26 P.S. § 1-611, governing compensation for delay in payment.
(2) actions in which damages for delay are allowable in absence of this
rule.
Official Note: See Marrazzo v. Scranton Nehi Bottling Co., Inc., 438 Pa. 72, 263 A.2d 336
(1970), for instances in which compensation for delay may be allowed in actions for destruction
or involuntary conversion of property where the compensation can be measured by market value
or other definite standards.
(f) This rule shall apply to actions pending on or after the effective date of
this rule in which damages for delay have not been determined.

Rule 401. Time for Service. Reissuance, Reinstatement, and Substitution
of Original Process.
(a) Original process shall be served within the Commonwealth within
30 days after the issuance of the writ or the filing of the complaint.
Note: See Rule 404 for the time for service outside the Commonwealth.
(b)(1) If service within the Commonwealth is not made within the time prescribed by subdivision (a) of this rule or outside the Commonwealth within the
time prescribed by Rule 404, the prothonotary upon praecipe and upon presentation of the original process, or a copy thereof, shall continue its validity by designating the writ as reissued or the complaint as reinstated.
(2) A writ may be reissued or a complaint reinstated at any time and any
number of times. A new party defendant may be named in a reissued writ or a
reinstated complaint only if the writ or complaint has not been served on any
defendant.
Note: A new party defendant cannot be added to a reissued writ or reinstated complaint if
service has been completed on a defendant already named in the writ or complaint. For cases
involving multiple defendants, a new party defendant cannot be added to a reissued writ or reinstated complaint if service has been completed on any defendant already named in the writ or
complaint.
If a new party defendant cannot be added pursuant to this rule, other procedures are available. See Rule 229 to discontinue the action and to start a new action; Rule 1033 to amend the
caption of a pleading by agreement of the party or by leave of court; and Rule 2232 to seek
leave of court for an order joining a defendant.

within the applicable time prescribed by subdivision (a) of this rule or by Rule
404 after reissuance, reinstatement, or substitution.
(5) If an action is commenced by writ of summons and a complaint is
thereafter filed, the plaintiff, instead of reissuing the writ, may treat the complaint as alternative original process and as the equivalent for all purposes of a
reissued writ, reissued as of the date of the filing of the complaint. Thereafter
the writ may be reissued, or the complaint may be reinstated as the equivalent
of a reissuance of the writ, and the plaintiff may use either the reissued writ or
the reinstated complaint as alternative original process.

complaint, the writ must be reissued or the complaint reinstated to be effective as process. Filing or reinstatement or substitution of a complaint, which is used as alternative process under
this subdivision, has been held effective in tolling the statute of limitations as the reissuance or

The provisions of this Rule 1901 adopted March 9, 1977, effective April 10, 1977, 7 Pa.B. 839;
amended March 30, 1994, effective July 1, 1994, 24 Pa.B. 1943; amended March 9, 1998, effective

October 19, 2021, effective January 1, 2022, 51 Pa.B. 6764. Immediately preceding text appears at
serial pages (390067) to (390068).
Rule 1901.1. Venue.
(a) Except as provided in subdivision (b), an action for protection from abuse
may be brought in a county in which
(1) the plaintiff resides, either temporarily or permanently, or is employed,
or
(2) the defendant may be served, or
(3) the abuse occurred.
PROTECTION FROM ABUSE ACT 231 Rule 1901
1900-1
(407023) No. 566 Jan. 22
(b) If the relief sought includes possession of the residence or household to
the exclusion of the defendant, the action shall be brought only in the county in
which the residence or household is located.
(c) An action for indirect criminal contempt may be filed in, and heard by,
the court in the county in which the order was issued or where the violation
occurred.
Explanatory Comment—1991
The statute and rules governing actions for protection from abuse formerly contained no provision
for venue. Recommendation No. 84 of the Civil Procedural Rules Committee proposed a new rule to
fill that void and the rule has been adopted as Rule 1901.1.
Subdivision (a) provides for venue in the following counties: (1) the county in which the abuse
occurred, (2) the county in which the defendant may be served, (3) the county in which the plaintiff
resides, either permanently or temporarily, and (4) the county in which the plaintiff is employed.
These are the counties with which the plaintiff has the most significant contacts and the greatest
interest in remaining free from abuse. The county of temporary residence is included because an
abused person may have to flee the county of permanent residence to escape further abuse.
The rule imposes limited venue when the relief sought includes the sole possession of the residence
or household. In that instance, the action must be brought in the county in which the residence or
household is located.
Explanatory Comment—2006
The 2005 amendments to the Protection From Abuse Act grant jurisdiction over indirect criminal
contempt complaints in either the county in which the order was issued or the county where the violation occurred. This rule allows for flexible and immediate enforcement of protection from abuse
orders. With this amendment, indirect criminal contempt jurisdiction is parallel to prosecution for
stalking and harassment. 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 6114 (a.1).

Rule 1901.3. Commencement of Action.
(a) Except as provided in subdivision (b), a plaintiff shall commence an
action by presenting to the court or filing with the prothonotary a petition setting
forth the alleged abuse by the defendant. The petition shall be substantially in the
form set forth in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1905(b) and shall have as its first page the Notice
of Hearing and Order set forth in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1905(a).

1900-2
(407024) No. 566 Jan. 22 Copyright  2022 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
(b) An action may be commenced by filing with the prothonotary a certified
copy of an emergency order entered pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S. § 6110, including
orders issued by a hearing officer.
(c) Any fees associated with this action shall not be charged to the plaintiff.
(d) The hearing officer shall follow the procedures set forth in the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure Governing Actions and Proceedings Before Magisterial District Judges for emergency relief under the Protection From Abuse Act.
Official Note: See Pa.R.C.P. No. 1930.1(b). This rule may require attorneys or unrepresented parties to file confidential documents and documents containing confidential information

Rule 1901.4. Service and Registration of Order.
(a) Service of the petition and temporary order shall be in accordance with
Rule 1930.4.
(b) An Affidavit of Service substantially in the form set forth in Rule 1905(d)
shall be filed with the prothonotary.
(c) Upon the filing of a protection order with the prothonotary, the prothonotary shall transmit a copy of the order to the State Police PFA Registry in the
manner prescribed by the Pennsylvania State Police.
Official Note: This provision also applies to an order denying a plaintiff’s request for a
final protection order.
(d) No fee shall be charged to the plaintiff or petitioner for service of any
protection from abuse order or pleading or for the registration, filing or service
of any foreign protection order.
Explanatory Comment—1997
Subdivision (c) reflects the prothonotary’s role in ensuring that all protection orders reach the new
statewide PFA Registry. Pursuant to the 1994 amendments to the Protection From Abuse Act, the
Pennsylvania State Police Department is mandated to establish this registry for all protection orders
issued or registered in the Commonwealth. Once it becomes fully operational, it will be available at
all times to inform law enforcement officers, dispatchers and courts of the existence and terms of protection orders. The Registry represents a major improvement in the manner in which protection orders
are registered and verified by not only eliminating the need to register the order in every county where
the victim believes enforcement is necessary, but also enabling the police to immediately verify the
order for purposes of enforcement. In order to ensure that the information in the Registry remains
current, subdivision (c) requires the prothonotary to transmit all protection orders issued or registered
PROTECTION FROM ABUSE ACT 231 Rule 1901.4
1900-3
(407025) No. 566 Jan. 22
in the Commonwealth, including temporary, final, modified and consent orders as well as any orders
withdrawing, extending or denying the plaintiff’s request for a protection order.
Explanatory Comment—2006
New subdivision (d) reflects the prohibition against charging fees to the plaintiff, even those related
to foreign protection orders, as set forth in the 2005 amendments to the Protection From Abuse Act.

Rule 1901.5. Enforcement.
(a) When an arrest is made for violation of an order, a complaint for indirect
criminal contempt shall be completed and signed by either a police officer, the
sheriff or the plaintiff. When the complaint is filed by a police officer or sheriff,
neither the plaintiff’s presence nor signature is required.

Explanatory Comment—2006
The 2005 amendments to the Protection From Abuse Act authorize the sheriff to arrest the defendant for violations of a protection from abuse order. In addition, the sheriff is authorized to exercise
a search and seizure of any firearm, other weapon and ammunition subsequent to arrest. 23 Pa.C.S.A.

Rule 1901.7. Decision. Post-trial Relief.
(a) The decision of the court may consist of only general findings of abuse
but shall dispose of all claims for relief. The court’s final order shall be rendered
substantially in the form set forth in Rule 1905(e).
(b) No motion for post-trial relief may be filed to the final order.
Official Note: The procedure relating to Motions for Reconsideration is set forth in Rule
1930.2.
(c) If a final protection from abuse order directs the defendant to pay support
to the plaintiff for the benefit of the plaintiff and/or a child, the plaintiff must file
a complaint for support with the domestic relations section within two weeks of
the date of the order or the support provisions of the order shall lapse automatically. If the plaintiff timely files with the domestic relations section, the support
provisions of the final protection from abuse order shall remain in effect until a
support order is entered.
(d) The custody provisions of a Protection From Abuse order are temporary.
Either party may initiate custody proceedings pursuant to the custody statute at
23 Pa.C.S. § 5321 et seq. Any valid custody order entered after the final Protection From Abuse order supersedes the custody provisions in paragraph 5 of the
Protection From Abuse order.
Explanatory Comment—1977
New Rules 1901, et seq. promulgated March 9, 1977 and effective 15 days after publication in the
Pennsylvania Bulletin implement the Protection From Abuse Act No. 218 of 1976 which became
effective December 6, 1976.
The Act introduces a new civil remedy authorizing protective orders to bring about cessation of
abuse of the plaintiff or minor children, which relief includes, inter alia, exclusion of the errant spouse
from the household, the award of temporary custody and visitation rights with regard to minor children and support.
The Act also authorizes temporary ex parte orders when the exigency of the situation requires
immediate relief before process can be served on a defendant.
Jurisdiction is also conferred on the magisterial district judges over the weekend if and when a
judge of the court of common pleas is not available, but any temporary order of a magisterial district
judge expires at the resumption of business of the common pleas court at the beginning of the week
or within seventy-two (72) hours, whichever occurs first. The magisterial district judge is required
immediately to certify his or her order to the common pleas court and the certification under the Act
has the effect of commencing a proceeding in the common pleas court and invoking the other provisions of the Act.
Section 9 of the Act provides that all proceedings shall be in accordance with Rules of Civil Procedure and shall be in addition to any other available civil or criminal remedies.
Explanatory Comment—2005
Act 207-2004 amended numerous titles of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes changing the
title of ‘‘district justice’’ to ‘‘magisterial district judge.’’ The amendments to Rule 1901.7’s Explanatory Comment—1977 reflect the change in title, make the comment gender-neutral and delete outdated material.

Rule 1901.8. Modification or Discontinuance.
(a) In cases in which a temporary protection order has not yet been granted
or has been denied, a plaintiff in a protection from abuse action who wishes to
discontinue the action may file a praecipe to discontinue, pursuant to Pa.R.C.P.
229, prior to the final order hearing. The party may also request the discontinuance by oral motion at a hearing.
(b) In cases in which a temporary protection order has been granted, a plaintiff in a protection from abuse action who wishes to vacate the temporary order
and discontinue the action shall either file a petition with the court prior to the
final order hearing or make the request by oral motion at the final order hearing.
(c) If either party seeks a modification after a final judgment has been entered
in a protection from abuse action, the party shall petition the court to modify the
final order. The court shall enter an order granting or denying the petition following an appearance by the petitioner before the court.
Explanatory Comment—2013
Jurisdictions across the commonwealth have adopted varying procedures and processes for the
withdrawal, discontinuance and modification of protection from abuse actions. This rule provides a
uniform process that comports with the requirements of 23 Pa.C.S. §§ 6107(b)(2) (related to hearings), 6117 (related to procedure and other remedies) and Commonwealth v. Charnik, 921 A.2d 1214
(Pa. Super. 2007). These requirements, when read together, require a different procedure for withdrawal, discontinuance and modification at various stages in a protection from abuse proceeding.
After a final protection order is entered, and no motion to reconsider or appeal is filed, the court
no longer retains jurisdiction to vacate that order. Charnik, 921 A.2d at 1217. The court does, however, have jurisdiction to modify a protection from abuse order at any time after the filing of a petition for modification, service of the petition and a hearing on the petition. 23 Pa.C.S. § 6117. Thus,
a party may request that the court modify the order to expire at an earlier date if the party does not
want the order to remain in effect.

you must provide an affidavit to the sheriff or the appropriate law enforcement
agency listing the firearms, other weapons, or ammunition and their current location no later than 24 hours after service of the order. Failure to timely relinquish
any firearm, other weapon, ammunition, or any firearm license shall result in a

Firearms Act, 18 Pa.C.S. § 6105.
NOTICE: Even if this order does not direct you to relinquish firearms, you
may be subject to federal firearms prohibitions and federal criminal penalties
under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(8) or state firearms prohibitions and state criminal
penalties under 18 Pa.C.S. § 6105.

agency or transferred to a licensed firearm dealer or a qualified third party, who

PROTECTION FROM ABUSE ACT 231 Rule 1905
1900-27
(396071) No. 535 Jun. 19
Explanatory Comment—1997
The use of standardized forms provides uniformity and is also critical to the enforcement of protection orders both inside and outside of the commonwealth. These forms are substantially based on
those proposed by members of the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence and have been
further refined to accommodate the litigants’ need for simplicity, the court’s need for flexibility and
law enforcements’ need for certain identifying information necessary to enforce the protection order.
The forms must be used so that all protection orders can be properly registered with the statewide
PFA Registry and the federal Protection Order File (POF) established by the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) for the collection of information that is necessary for nationwide enforcement of
protection orders. Entering a protection order into the Registry and NCIC file enables law enforcement to immediately verify the existence and terms of the order. It is important, therefore, that all
protection orders be registered with these two files. To this end, the forms capture all of the information that is required for data entry and the form orders are further structured to present that information in the order and sequence that is most helpful to the various law enforcement agencies responsible for entering the information into the files. Once the information reaches the Registry and is
accepted by the NCIC file, it becomes immediately accessible to law enforcement agencies, dispatchers and courts throughout the country.
The provisions in the form petition and orders reflect the most common forms of relief available
under the Protection From Abuse Act. Plenty of space, however, is provided for the plaintiff to request
additional relief, and for courts to fashion appropriate relief, based on the individual circumstances of
the litigants. Since all of the provisions will not necessarily apply in every case, the forms adopt a
checkbox method that requires the user to affirmatively check only those provisions which are applicable to his or her situation.
In cases where a provision is generally applicable but its terms do not correspond precisely to the
relief being requested or granted, the user should not check the standard provision but instead should
use the blank spaces provided in the forms to specify the relief. For example, while the final order
contains a standard provision permitting the defendant to retrieve personal belongings only in the
company of a police officer, there may be more suitable methods of retrieval available in some cases.
If so, then the plaintiff or court should use the blank spaces provided in the form petition or order
(rather than the standard provision) to specify the alternative manner of retrieval.
Explanatory Comment—2000
Paragraph 2 of the final order has been amended to enable courts to include additional conditions
for the retrieval of personalty by the defendant in a section of the final order which permits arrest
without a warrant if the conditions are violated. Paragraph 9 of the final order has been amended to
require the filing of a support complaint within two weeks, rather than fifteen days, of the entry of a
final order under the Protection From Abuse Act to prevent the automatic lapse of any temporary support provisions included in the order. This change is consistent with the statutory provisions at 23
Pa.C.S.A. § 6108(a)(5).
Explanatory Comment—2006
The Notice to Defend in subdivision (a) was amended to include three notice requirements of the
2005 Protection From Abuse Act amendments, Act 66 of 2005. 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 6107 (a). The amendments provide that sheriffs may arrest defendants for violations of protective orders. The notice also
advises the defendant that if firearms, other weapons or ammunition cannot reasonably be retrieved
within the required time, the defendant must provide the sheriff with an affidavit listing the firearms,
other weapons and ammunition and their current location within 24 hours. Pa.C.S.A.
§ 6108(a)(7)(i)(B). In addition, defendants have the option to turn firearms, other weapons and
ammunition over to a qualified third party instead of the sheriff, and federal firearms prohibitions and
penalties are more clearly stated.
231 Rule 1905 GENERAL
1900-28
(396072) No. 535 Jun. 19 Copyright  2019 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
The 2005 amendments to the Protection From Abuse Act require several changes to the form petition at subdivision (b). The plaintiff is required to inform the court if the defendant works in a job
that requires the handling of firearms. This provision was included to allow courts to exercise appropriate discretion when a defendant is exempt from federal firearm prohibitions and penalties. It also
directs the court to ‘‘make a reasonable effort to preserve the financial assets of the defendant’s business while fulfilling the goals’’ of the Protection From Abuse Act. 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 6108(a)(7.1). Federal law prohibits possession of firearms and penalizes defendants who possess them if they are subject to an order prohibiting abuse, stalking or harassment. However, certain law enforcement officials
are exempt from this prohibition and penalty. Under 18 U.S.C. § 925(a)(1), a person performing an
official duty on behalf of the federal, state or local law enforcement agency may possess a firearm as
long as the officer is required to possess the firearm in his or her official capacity. The Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms requires the official possession of the firearm to be authorized by
statute, regulation or official department policy. The new notice requirement is found in 23 Pa.C.S.A.
§ 6106 (a.2).
Paragraph 14 of the form petition was amended to address the manner in which the firearms and
other weapons were used against the plaintiff or minor children and to remove the listing of firearms
in the petition itself. The amended statute prohibits public access to any list or inventory of the defendant’s firearms, other weapons or ammunition. Thus, a separate Attachment A is included at the end
of the petition for purposes of listing the firearms, other weapons and ammunition at issue. This will
allow the prothonotary to more easily redact the list from public access, while at the same time permitting the court, the parties and law enforcement agencies to enforce the order. 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 6108
(a)(7)(v). Section 6108(a)(7) of the Protection From Abuse Act provides for relinquishment of other
weapons and ammunition only if they have been used or threatened to be used in an act of abuse.
Paragraph 14 and Attachment A to Petition balance the court’s need to be advised of firearms, other
weapons and ammunition used or threatened to be used in an act of abuse or available to the defendant with the plaintiff’s right to decline to seek relinquishment of some or all of those firearms, other
weapons and ammunition.
The form petition also was amended to address the court’s authority to order the defendant to
relinquish any and all firearms, whether they were used or threatened to be used in an act of abuse
or not. Any one of several circumstances authorizes the court to grant this relief, including, but not
limited to, abuse involving a firearm or weapon or an immediate and present danger of abuse. The
amended statute provides the court with multiple examples of what may constitute proof of immediate and present danger for the purposes of ordering the relinquishment of any or all of the defendant’s
firearms. 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 6107(b)(3). Finally, the form addresses the court’s authority to order the
defendant to relinquish other weapons and ammunition which were used or threatened to be used in
an act of abuse.
The form temporary order retains a space for the defendant’s Social Security number. Pursuant to
23 Pa.C.S.A. § 6108(b), ‘‘[a]ny order issued under this section shall, where furnished by either party,
specify the Social Security number and date of birth of the defendant.’’
In subdivisions (c) and (e), paragraph three in the form temporary and final orders is amended to
clarify that even indirect contact with a protected person may be prohibited. This clarification reflects
the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s holding in Commonwealth v. Baker, 564 Pa. 192, 766 A.2d 328
(2001), that the order must be ‘‘definite, clear, specific and leave no doubt or uncertainty in the mind
of the person to whom it was addressed of the prohibited conduct.’’
The amendments to paragraph five of the form temporary and final orders are consistent with the
statutory provisions of the Protection From Abuse Act relating to custody. See 23 Pa.C.S.A
§ 6108(a)(4).
The 2005 amendments to the Protection From Abuse Act provide that the court may order the
defendant to relinquish ammunition and firearm licenses, in addition to firearms and other weapons.
PROTECTION FROM ABUSE ACT 231 Rule 1905
1900-29
(396073) No. 535 Jun. 19
23 Pa.C.S.A. § 6108(a)(7) and 7.1. These items were added to paragraph six of the temporary and
final order forms, the notices to the defendant and the notices to the sheriff, police and law enforcement.
The amendments to paragraph six of the form orders also provide the court with discretion to place
certain restrictions on firearms possession or to completely proscribe firearms possession. The
amended paragraphs and the notices to the defendant inform the parties that if the defendant is ordered
to relinquish firearms, weapons or ammunition, they must be relinquished to the sheriff or, in the
alternative, they may be relinquished to a third party who complies with the substantive and procedural requirements for a third party safekeeping permit. 23 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 6107(a), 6108.3. Upon entry
of a final order, the defendant may also relinquish firearms, other weapons or ammunition to a
licensed firearms dealer. No matter which option Defendant chooses, if firearms and weapons are
ordered to be relinquished, any firearm license ordered to be relinquished must be relinquished to the
sheriff. The aforementioned items may be relinquished at the time of service, but no later than 24
hours after service unless, with regard to firearms, other weapons or ammunition, they cannot reasonably be retrieved due to their location. 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 6108 (a)(7)(i). The notice to the defendant in
the final order was expanded to advise the defendant that violation of the order may result in the
revocation of the third-party safekeeping permit.
Paragraph seven of the final order form was amended to reflect 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 6108.1(a) and other
statutory provisions concerning the return of firearms.
Paragraph ten of the final order form was amended to reflect the statute’s prohibition against
charging the plaintiff fees or costs related to filing, service, registration or appeal in any Protection
From Abuse matter. A new subparagraph (b) in paragraph ten of the final order reflects the 2005
amendments to the Protection From Abuse Act which increased the surcharge a court may order a
defendant to pay when an action is contested and directs the disbursement of the collected surcharges.
23 Pa.C.S.A. § 6106(d).
Paragraph fourteen of the final order form was amended to reflect the increased period of protection the court may grant. The maximum period of protection was increased from eighteen months to
three years.
The amended notice to the sheriff, police and law enforcement in the final order clarifies that the
defendant may be arrested anywhere a violation occurs, and that the court has jurisdiction to hear the
issue of indirect criminal contempt either where the order was issued or where the violation occurred.
With this amendment, jurisdiction for indirect criminal contempt is parallel to prosecution for stalking and harassment. 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 6114(a.1). The notice also makes it clear that a search and seizure of firearms may occur without a warrant when incident to arrest. 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 6113(b) and
6121.
Other amendments to the order forms reflect that the sheriff is authorized to arrest for violations of
the order under the Protection From Abuse Act. 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 6113. The references to a protective
order superseding provisions of a prior custody order were moved to paragraph five, which deals with
custody, in both the temporary and final orders.
Explanatory Comment—2008
The Protection From Abuse petition form, temporary order form and final order form are being
modified to conform to the model template used in Project Passport. Project Passport was designed
to improve recognition and enforcement of protection orders within and between states and tribes by
encouraging states and tribes to adopt a recognizable first page for protection orders. Use of the model
template is supported by the National Center for State Courts and the National American Indian Court
Judges Association.
The critical aspects of the model template for the first page are common data elements jointly
identified by multi-disciplinary teams. Using a recognizable first page for protection orders with this
231 Rule 1905 GENERAL
1900-30
(396074) No. 535 Jun. 19 Copyright  2019 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
essential data readily available and easily recognizable on a protection order, particularly on ‘‘foreign
protection orders,’’ helps strengthen the safety net for domestic violence survivors and their children
by offering greater consistency in the issuance and enforcement of protection orders.
Implementation of the model first page for Project Passport requires several changes to the Pennsylvania Protection From Abuse petition, temporary order and final order forms. The petition form
caption, as well as the plaintiff’s or filer’s name, relationship to the plaintiff, names and dates of birth
of the protected persons, plaintiff’s address, defendant’s address, social security number, place of
employment, and age, were moved to the Project Passport first page. The petition paragraphs are also
renumbered. On the temporary order and final order forms, the captions and the defendant’s name,
date of birth and social security number, as well as the names of the plaintiff and protected persons
and dates of birth, were moved to the Project Passport first page. The Project Passport first page for
the petition and temporary and final orders all include physical identifiers for the defendant and an
indication if weapons were involved, present on the property or relinquished. The first page of the
final order also includes the effective and expiration dates of the protection order and the notice to
the defendant.

Official Note: A duty of support is imposed by the following statutes: 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 4321
and Section 3 of the Support Law of June 24, 1937, P. L. 2045, 62 P. S. § 1973 (repealed) now
Act 43-2005, July 7, 2005, P. L. 196. The procedure under the rules of this chapter implements
Chapter 43 of Part V of the Domestic Relations Code, Title 23 of the Consolidated Statutes, 23
Pa.C.S.A. § 4301 et seq., relating to support proceedings. The procedure under these rules provides an alternative to the intrastate and interstate procedures under Parts VIII and VIII-A of the
Domestic Relations Code, 23 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 7101 et seq. and 8101 et seq. For alimony and alimony pendente lite, see Sections 3701 and 3702 of the Divorce Code, 23 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 3701,
3702.
Official Note: Long arm jurisdiction is available in support actions brought pursuant to
these rules per 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 4342(c).
(b) The rules of this chapter shall not govern
(1) an action or proceeding for support based upon a contract or agreement
which provides that it may not be enforced by an action in accordance with
these rules,
(2) an application for a temporary order of support and other relief pursuant to the Protection from Abuse Act of December 19, 1990, P. L. 1240, No.
206, 23 Pa.C.S. § 6101 et seq. or
(3) an action for support of an indigent brought pursuant to Chapter 46 of
the Domestic Relations Code, 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 4601 et seq.

1910-2
(407028) No. 566 Jan. 22 Copyright  2022 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
Official Note: Where a contract or agreement provides that it cannot be enforced in accordance with the rules, actions upon a contract or agreement for support are to be heard by the
court and not a conference officer or hearing officer under Rules 1910.11 or 1910.12. However,
such actions should be expedited and given preference in court listings.
(c) As used in this chapter, unless the context of a rule indicates otherwise,
the following terms shall have the following meanings:
‘‘Conference officer,’’ the person who conducts an office conference pursuant to Rule 1910.11.
‘‘Hearing officer,’’ the person who conducts a hearing on the record and
makes recommendations to the court pursuant to Rule 1910.12.
‘‘Overdue support,’’ the amount of delinquent support equal to or greater
than one month’s support obligation which accrues after entry or modification
of a support order as the result of obligor’s nonpayment of that order.
‘‘Past due support,’’ the amount of support which accrues prior to entry or
modification of a support order as the result of retroactivity of that order. When
nonpayment of the order causes overdue support to accrue, any and all amounts
of past due support owing under the order shall convert immediately to overdue support and remain as such until paid in full.
‘‘Suspend,’’ eliminate the effect of a support order for a period of time.
‘‘Terminate,’’ end not only the support order, but the support obligation as
well.
‘‘Trier-of-fact,’’ the judge, hearing officer, or conference officer who makes
factual determinations.
‘‘Vacate,’’ declare a particular support order null and void, as if it were never
entered.
Explanatory Comment—1994
Nothing in this rule should be interpreted to eliminate the distinctions between spousal support and
alimony pendente lite which are established by case law.
Alimony pendente lite must be distinguished from permanent alimony for purposes of this rule.
The rule applies only to alimony pendente lite. The procedure for obtaining permanent alimony is
governed by Section 3702 of the Divorce Code, 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 3702, and Rules of Civil Procedure
1920.1 et seq. Agreements for alimony approved by the court in connection with actions for divorce
under Section 3701 of the Divorce Code are deemed to be court orders enforceable under Section
3703 of the Code.
Section 3105(a) of the Divorce Code provides that all agreements relating to matters under the
code, whether or not merged or incorporated into the decree, are to be treated as orders for purposes
of enforcement unless the agreement provides otherwise. Subdivision (b)(1) is amended to conform
to the statute.
There is considerable diversity in the terminology used throughout the rules, and in the various
counties, to describe the individuals who conduct conferences and hearings pursuant to the support
rules. The addition of subdivision (c) to the rules standardizes terminology and eliminates the confusion which results from individual counties using inconsistent terms to refer to persons performing
the same function. All references in the rules to conference or hearing officers have been amended to
conform to the terminology set forth in subdivision (c).
In an effort to further standardize the terminology used in support matters, the additional terms are
defined.
ACTIONS FOR SUPPORT 231 Rule 1910.1
1910-3
(407029) No. 566 Jan. 22
Explanatory Comment—2000
Act 1998-127 technically amended Act 1997-58 to define and differentiate between past due and
overdue support to clarify that only overdue support constitutes a lien by operation of law against the
obligor’s real or personal property. 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 4302 now defines overdue support as ‘‘support
which is delinquent under a payment schedule established by the court.’’ Past due support is defined
as ‘‘support included in an order of support which has not been paid.’’
The definitions of past due and overdue support in this rule do not substantively change the legislative definitions. They merely elaborate on them in terms which are more familiar and helpful to the
bench and bar. Specifically, past due support consists of the purely retroactive arrearages which accumulate between the date of the filing of the complaint or petition for modification and the date of the
hearing and entry of the initial or modified support order. Overdue support refers to the delinquent
arrearages which accrue after entry of the order due to the obligor’s failure to pay support pursuant
to the order.
These definitions are important for determining the remedies available for collecting support arrearages. Pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 4352(d), only overdue support (delinquent arrearages) constitutes a
lien by operation of law against the obligor’s property. Conversely, past due support (retroactive
arrears) does not operate as a lien against this property as long as the obligor remains current on the
support order.
Rule 1910.20 extends this legislative distinction between overdue and past due support to the following remedies available to collect support: (1) consumer agency reporting under 23 Pa.C.S.A.
§ 4303; (2) suspension of licenses under 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 4355; and (3) the full range of new collection remedies under 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 4305(b)(10). Accordingly, these remedies are available only to
collect overdue support. They are not available to collect past due support as long as the obligor
remains current on the order. If, however, the obligor subsequently defaults on the support order, Rule
1910.20(c) provides that any past due support still owing under the order immediately becomes overdue support subject to the full range of collection remedies. It remains overdue support until collected
in full.
Pursuant to Rule 1910.20(c), all overdue support, including past due support which has converted
to overdue support, remains subject to Act 58 remedies until paid in full. Any repayment plan subsequently agreed to by the parties, or ordered by the court pursuant to a contempt proceeding (including
any arrearage component), does not preclude the use of these remedies for collecting overdue support
more quickly, whenever feasible.
In cases involving past due support only, the obligee is not entirely without remedy in the event
that additional income or assets of the obligor are discovered after the hearing which would enable
collection of past due support more quickly. In these cases, identification of those income sources or
assets provides a basis for modification pursuant to Rule 1910.19. Modification includes increasing
the rate of repayment on past due support and, if appropriate, ordering that the past due support be
paid in full. In these cases, the obligee may also petition the court for special relief pursuant to Rule
1910.26 to have the income or assets frozen and seized pending the petition for modification in order
to secure payment of past due support.
Explanatory Comment—2007
Act 43-2005, July 7, 2005, P. L. 196, repealed the Act of June 24, 1937 (P. L. 2045, No. 397),
known as The Support Law and added Chapter 46 to the Domestic Relations Code, 23 Pa.C.S.A.
§ 4601 et seq. Section 4 of Act 43-2005 states that the addition of Chapter 46 is a continuation of the
Act of June 24, 1937 (P. L. 2045, No. 397). Chapter 46 addresses the responsibility of certain family
members to maintain indigent relatives, whether or not the indigent person is a public charge. New
subdivision (b)(3) clarifies that the support rules and guidelines do not apply to actions brought under
Chapter 46 of the Domestic Relations Code.

Rule 1910.2. Venue. Transfer of Action.
(a) An action may be brought in
(1) the county in which the defendant resides, or
(2) the county in which the defendant is regularly employed, or
(3) the county in which the plaintiff resides and that county is the county
in which the last marital domicile was located and in which the plaintiff has
continued to reside.
(4) the county in which the child resides if the relief sought includes child
support.
Official Note: If an action for support is brought in the county in which the plaintiff resides
but that county is not the county in which the last family domicile was located and in which the
plaintiff has continued to reside, the action shall proceed in accordance with the Revised Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (1968), 23 Pa.C.S. § 4501 et seq. if the defendant
is outside the Commonwealth, or in accordance with 23 Pa.C.S. § 4533 which provides for
intrastate application of RURESA if the defendant is within the Commonwealth, and not in
accordance with these Rules.
(b) Where jurisdiction is acquired over the defendant pursuant to the long
arm statute, 23 Pa.C.S. § 4342(c), the action may be brought in the county where
the plaintiff resides.
Official Note: 23 Pa.C.S. § 7201 sets forth the specific bases for long arm jurisdiction over
a non-resident defendant.
(c) If, at the time of the filing of the action, there is a divorce or custody
action pending between the parties in an appropriate court in another county, the
court upon good cause shown may transfer the support action to that county.
(d) For the convenience of the parties and witnesses the court may transfer
an action to the appropriate court of any other county where the action could have
been brought at the time of transfer.
Official Note: The standards for transfer of an action for the convenience of parties and
witnesses are the same as the standards under Rule 1006(d).
(e) A support order may be enforced in accordance with the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act, 23 Pa.C.S. § 7101 et seq., if the defendant resides outside the Commonwealth, or in accordance with the Intrastate Family Support Act,
23 Pa.C.S. § 8101 et seq., if the defendant resides in another county within the
Commonwealth.

1910-5
(407031) No. 565 Jan. 22
Rule 1910.2-1. Procedures Pursuant to the Intrastate Family Support
Act.
(a) The court in the county in which the complaint for support is filed shall
retain and process the case for so long as all of the following conditions are met:
(1) there is proper venue pursuant to Rule 1910.2;
(2) the defendant-obligor’s mailing address is known;
(3) sufficient information is known about the defendant-obligor’s employment to enable the court to issue an earnings subpoena; and
(4) the obligee consents.
Official Note: A support action should be maintained in the county in which the obligee
and/or the child(ren) reside and should not involve a second county unless the county of residence is unable to obtain service on the defendant-obligor or obtain information regarding the
defendant-obligor’s employment. However, the obligee is permitted to request that the case proceed under the Intrastate Family Support Act (IFSA) in accordance with 23 Pa.C.S. § 8103.
If the venue requirements are met, the court in the obligee’s county of residence should
attempt to retain the case if there already is an order in that county against the same defendantobligor in this or another child/spousal support case or if the defendant-obligor is incarcerated.
(b) If courts in two or more counties must be involved in the establishment
and enforcement of an obligation for support:
(1) the case must proceed pursuant to the Intrastate Family Support Act;
and
(2) venue shall follow the defendant-obligor in order to maintain the availability of statutory enforcement remedies.
(c) A support order shall not be registered in another county unless:
(1) requested by the obligee, or
(2) necessary to maintain an order for support, to obtain payment of the
support obligation or to consolidate multiple cases involving the same
defendant-obligor.
(d) Only one support order shall be charging against a defendant-obligor for
the same spouse and/or child(ren) at one time.

(a) An action may be brought
(1) by a person, including a minor parent or a minor spouse, to whom a
duty of support is owing, or
(2) on behalf of a minor child by a person having custody of the child,
without appointment as guardian ad litem, or
(3) on behalf of a minor child by a person caring for the child regardless
of whether a court order has been issued granting that person custody of the
child, or
(4) by a public body or private agency having an interest in the case,
maintenance or assistance of a person to whom a duty of support is owing, or
231 Rule 1910.2-1 GENERAL

(5) by a parent, guardian or public or private agency on behalf of an
unemancipated child over eighteen years of age to whom a duty of support is
owing, or.
(6) by any person who may owe a duty of support to a child or spouse. If
the person to whom a duty of support may be owed does not appear, the action
may be dismissed without prejudice for the petitioner to seek further relief from
the court.
(b) The trier of fact shall enter an appropriate order based upon the evidence
presented, without regard to which party initiated the support action, filed a
modification petition or filed a petition for recovery of support overpayment. The
determination of which party will be the obligee and which will be the obligor
will be made by the trier of fact based upon the respective incomes of the parties,
consistent with the support guidelines and existing law, and the custodial arrangements at the time of the initial or subsequent conference, hearing or trial. If supported by the evidence, the party named as the defendant in the initial pleading
may be deemed to be the obligee, even if that party did not file a complaint for
support. The provisions of this subdivision do not apply to parties seeking spousal support or alimony pendente lite. Parties seeking spousal support or alimony
pendente lite must assert a claim in an appropriate pleading with proper notice
served upon the other party.
(1) In general, the party who has primary custody of the children shall be
the obligee of a child support order.
(2) When the parties share custody of the children equally, the party with
the higher income shall be the obligor as provided in Rule 1910.16-4(c)(2).
Explanatory Comment—1999
New subdivision (c) incorporates 23 Pa.C.S. § 4341(b) to confer standing on any person who is
caring for a child to seek support on behalf of that child even though there is no court order granting
legal or physical custody to that person. The statutory provision effectively overrules Larson v.
Diveglia, 549 Pa. 118, 700 A.2d 931 (1997), which held to the contrary.
Subdivision (e) is amended to eliminate the requirement of consent when the child is over 18 years
of age. This requirement was originally intended only for applicable child support actions for higher
educational support, which actions were abolished by Curtis v. Kline, 542 Pa. 249, 666 A.2d 265
(1995). This rule also is intended to apply to children who are unemancipated by reason of physical
or mental disability, consistent with 23 Pa.C.S. § 4321(3) as interpreted by case law.
Explanatory Comment—2011
A new category has been added in subdivision (a) to allow a party who may not have primary custody of the parties’ child or who may owe a duty of support to a spouse to initiate a support action
in which an appropriate order may be entered. In some cases, the obligor may want to start paying
spousal support or alimony pendente lite to the obligee as soon as possible to avoid the accumulation
of retroactive arrears, but § 71 of the Internal Revenue Code provides that payments to a spouse or
ex-spouse must be pursuant to an order or a divorce or separation instrument to receive alimony tax
treatment. Thus, any payments made prior to the entry of a support order will not be deductible by
the obligor. This provision is intended to allow an obligor to commence the process by which he or
she may pay support earlier.
A new subdivision (b) has been added to clarify that in all initial and subsequent child support
actions, the trier of fact may enter a support order against either party, without regard to which party
filed the complaint or petition for modification. This facilitates judicial economy, and relieves the
parties from incurring additional filing fees, losing time from work or family, losing retroactivity and
having to wait for a new proceeding to be scheduled. It enables the trier of fact to base the order on
the facts and circumstances at the time of the proceeding, which may be different than at the time of
filing.

Explanatory Comment
In accordance with Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.10, a judicial district may opt for one of two procedures for
support matters; the procedure selected is then certified by the president judge or administrative judge
to the Domestic Relations Procedural Rules Committee as prescribed in subdivision (b). Subdivision
(b) was added in response to requests from appellate court judges who find that it is often difficult to
determine the rule with which the actual support procedure is intended to comply. Subsequently, a
judicial district may, at any time, change its support procedure by filing a new certification with the
staff of the Domestic Relations Procedural Rules Committee indicating the rule according to which
support matters will proceed. However, a judicial district may, by local rule, permit interstate actions
to proceed directly to a hearing officer or judge without a conference.
The procedure set forth in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.11 provides for a conference before a conference
officer, a conference summary and entry of an interim order for support calculated in accordance with
the guidelines, and a right to demand a hearing de novo before a judge. The hearing must be held and
the final order entered within 60 days of the written demand for hearing.
The alternate procedure, as set forth in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.12, provides for a conference before a
conference officer, a record hearing before a hearing officer, and issuance of a report and recommendation to which exceptions may be filed within ten days. The court must hear argument and enter a
final order within 60 days of the filing of exceptions.
In lieu of continuing the practice of including in the Note a 67-county list identifying the hearing
procedure selected by the local county court, the list can now be found on the Domestic Relations
Procedural Rules Committee website.

Explanatory Comment—1994
The domestic relations office conference provided by Rule 1910.11 constitutes the heart of the
support procedure. There are two primary advantages to the inclusion of a conference. First, in many
cases the parties will agree upon an amount of support and a final order will be prepared, to be entered
by the court, thus dispensing with a judicial hearing. Second, those cases which do go to hearing can
proceed more quickly because the necessary factual information has already been gathered by the
conference officer.
Subdivision (a)(2) prohibits certain officers of the court from practicing family law before fellow
officers of the same court. These officers are the conference officer who is an attorney (Rule 1910.11),
the hearing officer (Rule 1910.12), and the standing or permanent master who is employed by the
court (Rule 1920.51). The amendments are not intended to apply to the attorney who is appointed
occasionally to act as a master in a divorce action.
Subdivision (e)(3) makes clear that even if the parties agree on an amount of support, the conference officer is still empowered to recommend to the court that the agreement be disapproved. This
provision is intended to protect the destitute spouse who might out of desperation agree to an amount
of support that is unreasonably low or which would in effect bargain away the rights of the children.
The officer’s disapproval of the agreement serves to prevent an inadequate order being entered unwittingly by the court.
The provision for an interim order in subdivision (f) serves two purposes. First, it ensures that the
obligee will receive needed support for the period during which the judicial determination is sought.
Second, it eliminates the motive of delay in seeking a judicial determination.
Because the guidelines are income driven, the trier of fact has little need for the expense information required in the Income and Expense Statement. Therefore in guideline cases, the rule no longer
requires that expense information be provided. If a party feels that there are expenses so extraordinary that they merit consideration by the trier of fact, that party is free to provide the information. In
cases decided according to Melzer v. Witsberger, 505 Pa. 462, 480 A.2d 991 (1984), living expenses
are properly considered, and therefore must be presented on the Income and Expense Statement.
ACTIONS FOR SUPPORT 231 Rule 1910.11
1910-13
(407035) No. 566 Jan. 22
Explanatory Comment—1995
Rule 1910.11(e) is amended to eliminate the need for a party to request a copy of the conference
summary.
Because the court is required to enter a guideline order on the basis of the conference officer’s recommendation, there is no need for (g)(2), which provided for a hearing before the court where an
order was not entered within five days of the conference. It is eliminated accordingly.
Pursuant to subdivision (g), support payments are due and owing under the interim order which
continues in effect until the court enters a final order after the hearing de novo. The provision for an
interim order serves two purposes. First, it ensures that the obligee will receive needed support for
the period during which the judicial determination is sought. Second, it eliminates the motive of delay
in seeking a judicial determination. Therefore, the plaintiff and the dependent children are not prejudiced by allowing the court sixty days, rather than the original forty-five, in which to enter its final
order.
Explanatory Comment—2006
The time for filing a written demand for a hearing before the court has been expanded from ten to
twenty days. The purpose of this amendment is to provide ample opportunity for litigants and counsel
to receive notice of the entry of the order, to assure commonwealth-wide consistency in calculation
of time for filing and to conform to applicable general civil procedural rules.
The amendments reflect the separated Income Statement and Expense Statements in Rule
1910.27(c).
Explanatory Comment—2010
When the parties’ combined net income exceeds $30,000 per month, calculation of child support,
spousal support and alimony pendente lite shall be pursuant to Rule 1910.16-3.1. Rule 1910.16-2(e)
has been amended to eliminate the application of Melzer v. Witsberger, 505 Pa. 462, 480 A.2d 991
(1984), in high income child support cases.
Explanatory Comment—2011
The rule has been amended to require that income information be provided in all cases, unless both
parties are represented in reaching an agreement, so that a guidelines calculation can be performed.
The guidelines create a rebuttable presumption that the amount calculated pursuant to them is the correct amount, so there should be a calculation in every case. If parties agree to receive or to pay an
order other than the guideline amount, they should know what that amount is so that they can enter
an agreement knowingly. If both parties are represented by counsel, it is assumed that their entry into
the agreement for an amount other than a guidelines amount is knowing as it is counsels’ responsibility to advise the parties. In addition, part of the mandatory quadrennial review of the support
guidelines mandates a study of the number of cases in which the support amount ordered varies from
the amount that would result from a guidelines calculation. Federal regulations presume that if a large
percentage of cases vary from the guideline amount, then the guidelines are not uniform statewide.

Rule 1910.12. Office Conference. Hearing. Record. Exceptions. Order.
(a) Office Conference. There shall be an office conference as provided by
Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.11(a) through (d). The provisions of Pa.R.C.P. No.

pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.12.
(b) Conference Conclusion.
(1) At the conclusion of a conference attended by both parties, if an agreement for support has not been reached, and the conference and hearing are not
scheduled on the same day, the court, without hearing the parties, shall enter
an interim order calculated in accordance with the guidelines and substantially
in the form set forth in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.27(e), and the parties shall be given
notice of the date, time and place of a hearing. A record hearing shall be conducted by a hearing officer who must be a lawyer.
(2) If either party, having been properly served, fails to attend the conference, the court may enter an interim order calculated in accordance with the
guidelines and substantially in the form set forth in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.27(e).
Within 20 days after the date of receipt or the date of mailing of the interim
order, whichever occurs first, either party may demand a hearing before a hearing officer. If no hearing is requested, the order shall become final.
(3) Any lawyer serving as a hearing officer employed by, or under contract
with, a judicial district or appointed by the court shall not practice family law
before a conference officer, hearing officer, or judge of the same judicial district.
Official Note: Conference officers preside at office conferences under Pa.R.C.P. No.
1910.11. Hearing officers preside at hearings under Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.12. The appointment of

(c) Separate Listing.
(1) Except as provided in subdivision (c)(2), promptly after the conference’s conclusion, a party may move the court for a separate listing of the

(iii) the orderly administration of justice requires that the hearing be
listed separately.
(2) When the conference and hearing are scheduled on the same day, all
requests for separate listing shall be presented to the court at least seven days
prior to the scheduled court date.
(3) If the motion for separate listing is granted, discovery shall be available
in accordance with Pa.R.C.P. No. 4001 et seq.

(d) The hearing officer shall receive evidence, hear argument and, not later
than 20 days after the close of the record, file with the court a report containing
a recommendation with respect to the entry of an order of support. The report
may be in narrative form stating the reasons for the recommendation and shall
include a proposed order substantially in the form set forth in Rule 1910.27(e)
stating:
(1) the amount of support calculated in accordance with the guidelines;
(2) by and for whom it shall be paid; and
(3) the effective date of the order.
(e) The court, without hearing the parties, shall enter an interim order consistent with the proposed order of the hearing officer. Each party shall be provided,
either in person at the time of the hearing or by mail, with a copy of the interim
order and written notice that any party may, within twenty days after the date of
receipt or the date of mailing of the order, whichever occurs first, file with the
domestic relations section written exceptions to the report of the hearing officer
and interim order.
Official Note: Objections to the entry of an interim order consistent with the proposed
order may be addressed pursuant to Rule 1910.26.
(f) Within twenty days after the date of receipt or the date of mailing of the
report by the hearing officer, whichever occurs first, any party may file exceptions to the report or any part thereof, to rulings on objections to evidence, to
statements or findings of facts, to conclusions of law, or to any other matters
occurring during the hearing. Each exception shall set forth a separate objection
precisely and without discussion. Matters not covered by exceptions are deemed
waived unless, prior to entry of the final order, leave is granted to file exceptions
raising those matters. If exceptions are filed, any other party may file exceptions
within twenty days of the date of service of the original exceptions.
(g) If no exceptions are filed within the twenty-day period, the interim order
shall constitute a final order.
(h) If exceptions are filed, the interim order shall continue in effect. The court
shall hear argument on the exceptions and enter an appropriate final order substantially in the form set forth in Rule 1910.27(e) within sixty days from the date
of the filing of exceptions to the interim order. No motion for post-trial relief may
be filed to the final order.
Explanatory Comment—1995
Language is added to subdivision (b) to acknowledge that the conference and hearing can be held
on the same day, and to provide for the immediate entry of an interim order in judicial districts where
the hearing occurs at a later date. New subdivision (b)(2) permits entry of a guideline order after a
conference which the defendant, though properly served, fails to attend. New subdivision (c)(2) is
intended to prevent delays in the hearing of complex cases by requiring that requests for separate listing be made at least seven days in advance where the conference and hearing are scheduled on the
same day.
231 Rule 1910.12 GENERAL
1910-16
(407038) No. 566 Jan. 22 Copyright  2022 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
In addition, the phrase ‘‘record hearing’’ in subdivision (a) replaces the reference to a ‘‘stenographic record’’ in recognition of the variety of means available to create a reliable record of support
proceedings.
Amended subdivision (e) allows an interim order to be entered and served on the parties at the
conclusion of the hearing, rather than after the expiration of the exceptions period as was true under
the old rule. In addition, the amended subdivision requires that the interim order include language
advising the parties of their right to file exceptions within ten days of the date of the order.
Support payments are due and owing under the interim order which continues in effect until the
court enters a final order after considering the parties’ exceptions. Therefore, extension of the deadline for entering the final order by fifteen days does not prejudice the persons dependent upon payment of the support.
Explanatory Comment—2006
The time for filing exceptions has been expanded from ten to twenty days. The purpose of this
amendment is to provide ample opportunity for litigants and counsel to receive notice of the entry of
the order, to assure commonwealth-wide consistency in calculation of time for filing and to conform
to applicable general civil procedural rules.

order of court, the court may issue a bench warrant for the arrest of the party if
it finds
(1) following a hearing on the record that the party had actual notice that
the party was ordered to attend the conference and/or hearing, or
(2) upon the affidavit of a hearing officer or conference officer that

(i) the order of court scheduling the conference and/or hearing was
served by ordinary mail with the return address of the domestic relations
section appearing thereon, that the mail was not returned to the domestic
relations section within fifteen days after mailing, and that, at a date after the
order of court was mailed, the domestic relations section has verified through
the U.S. Postal Service or by electronic means that mail for the party was
being delivered at the address to which the court order was mailed; or
(ii) the party signed a receipt indicating acceptance of a copy of the
court order; or
(iii) an employee of the court handed a copy of the order to the party; or
(iv) a competent adult handed a copy of the court order to the party, and
filed an affidavit of service.
Official Note: See Rule 76 for the definition of ‘‘competent adult.’’
The support statute, at 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 4353(a), requires parties to a support proceeding to
notify the domestic relations section within seven days of a change of personal address. Pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 4353(a.1), the court may deem due process service requirements to have
been met upon delivery of written notice to the most recent address the party filed with the
domestic relations section.
(b) The request for a bench warrant shall be made by the domestic relations
office within sixty days following the party’s failure to appear. The request shall
be in the form provided by Rule 1910.13-2(b), and shall include the hearing officer or conference officer’s certification that the party has not appeared for any
domestic relations matter involving the same parties since the date the party
failed to appear.
(c) Upon appearance in court by a party on the matter underlying the bench
warrant, the bench warrant shall be vacated forthwith and the notice shall be
given to all computer networks into which the bench warrant has been entered.
(d) When a bench warrant is executed, the case is to proceed in accordance
with the following procedures.
(1) When an individual is arrested pursuant to a bench warrant, he or she
shall be taken without unnecessary delay for a hearing on the bench warrant.
The hearing shall be conducted by the judicial officer who issued the bench
warrant, or, another judicial officer designated by the president judge or by the
president judge’s designee to conduct bench warrant hearings. As used in this
rule, ‘‘judicial officer’’ is limited to the common pleas court judge who issued
the bench warrant, or common pleas court judge designated by the president
judge or by the president judge’s designee to conduct bench warrant hearings.
(2) In the discretion of the judicial officer, the bench warrant hearing may
be conducted using two-way simultaneous audio-visual communication.
(3) When the individual is arrested in the county of issuance, and the bench
warrant hearing cannot be conducted promptly after the arrest, the individual
shall be lodged in the county jail pending the hearing. The authority in charge

of the county jail promptly shall notify the sheriff’s office and the director of
the domestic relations section that the individual is being held pursuant to the
bench warrant.
(4) When the individual is arrested outside the county of issuance, the
authority in charge of the county jail in the arresting county promptly shall
notify the proper authorities in the county of issuance that the individual is
being held pursuant to the bench warrant.
(5) The bench warrant hearing shall be conducted without unnecessary
delay after the individual is lodged in the jail of the county of issuance of that
bench warrant. The individual shall not be detained without a hearing on the
bench warrant longer than 72 hours, or the close of the next business day if the
72 hours expires on a non-business day.
(6) At the conclusion of the bench warrant hearing following the disposition of the matter, the judicial officer immediately shall vacate the bench warrant.
(7) If a bench warrant hearing is not held within the time limits in paragraph (d)(5), the bench warrant shall expire by operation of law.
Explanatory Comment—1994
In 1988, Section 4342 of the Domestic Relations Code, 23 Pa.C.S. § 4342, was amended to require
establishment of procedures for expedited contempt in support. Those procedures are set forth in new
Rules 1910.13-1, 1910.13-2, and 1910.21-1 through 1910.21-7.
Former Rule 1910.13 provided for the issuance of a bench warrant for failure of a person to obey
a court order other than an order for support. It is replaced with new Rule 1910.13-1 which sets forth
detailed procedures for the issuance of a bench warrant, and new Rule 1910.13-2 which provides the
associated forms. The new rules apply only to a party who fails to appear at a support conference or
hearing as directed by an order of court.
An individual arrested pursuant to a bench warrant can be incarcerated for a period not to exceed
seventy-two hours prior to hearing as set forth in new Rule 1910.13-1(d). Under the old rules, if the
court was unavailable at the time of arrest, the individual could not be held. Therefore, law enforcement officials were unable to execute bench warrants in the evenings or on weekends, when their
efforts were most likely to be successful. By limiting the possible period of incarceration to seventytwo hours, new Rule 1910.13-1(d) balances the need to bring parties before the court with the desire
to avoid lengthy pre-hearing detention. Bail can be set by the court where appropriate, providing
additional protection for the respondent.
Explanatory Comment—1999
The rules of civil procedure governing service of original process and other legal papers have used
the term ‘‘competent adult.’’ In certain circumstances, the term has been used with the restrictive language ‘‘who is not a party to the action.’’
The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has amended Definition Rule 76 by adding the following
definition: ‘‘‘competent adult’ means an individual eighteen years of age or older who is neither a
party to the action nor an employee or a relative of a party.’’ In view of this new definition, the rules
of civil procedure which used the term ‘‘competent adult who is not a party to the action’’ have been
amended by deleting as unnecessary the restrictive language ‘‘who is not a party to the action.’’ These
rules using the term ‘‘competent adult’’ will be governed by the new definition. The rules which used
ACTIONS FOR SUPPORT 231 Rule 1910.13-1

(390093) No. 521 Apr. 18
the term ‘‘competent adult’’ without the restrictive language have been amended by deleting the word
‘‘competent,’’ thus continuing to permit service by an adult without further restriction.
Explanatory Comment—2006
Beginning in 2006, bench warrants issued for failure to obey a court order to appear in a support
matter will be available through the Judicial Network (‘‘JNET’’) system. JNET expands the capacity
of law enforcement officers throughout the commonwealth to be informed of outstanding bench warrants issued by both the criminal and civil courts. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has promulgated new Pa.R.Crim.P. 150, effective August 1, 2006, which sets forth the procedure related to
criminal bench warrants. The amendments to Rules 1910.13-1 and 1910.13-2 track the new criminal
procedural rule so that bench warrant procedures will be uniform throughout the commonwealth. For
additional information see the Criminal Procedural Rules Committee’s Final Report explaining new
Pa.R.Crim.P. 150, published with the promulgation order at 36 Pa.B. 184 (January 14, 2006).

Rule 1910.14. Defendant Leaving Jurisdiction. Security.
At any stage of the proceeding, upon affidavit that the defendant is about to
leave the jurisdiction, the court may issue appropriate process directing that the
defendant be brought before the court at such time as the court may direct. At that
time the court may direct that the defendant give security, with one or more sureties, to appear when directed by the court or to comply with any order of court.
Rule 1910.15. Paternity.
(a) Acknowledgment of Paternity. If the action seeks support for a child born
out of wedlock and the alleged father is named as defendant, the defendant may
acknowledge paternity in a verified writing. The conference officer shall advise
the parties that pursuant to Section 5103(d) of Title 23 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes an acknowledgment constitutes conclusive evidence of defendant’s paternity without further judicial ratification in any action to establish support. Upon defendant’s execution of the written acknowledgment, the action shall
proceed as in other actions for support.
(b) Genetic Testing. If the defendant appears but does not execute an acknowledgment of paternity at the conference:
231 Rule 1910.14 GENERAL
1910-16.6
(390096) No. 521 Apr. 18 Copyright  2018 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
(1) The court shall enter an order directing the parties to appear for genetic
testing. The order must advise the defendant that his failure to appear for the
testing will result in entry of an order finding that he is the father of the child.
The order must also advise the plaintiff that her failure to appear for testing
may result in sanctions, including entry of an order dismissing the paternity
action without prejudice.
(2) The conference officer shall advise and provide written notice to the
parties that they may enter into a written stipulation whereby both agree to
submit to genetic testing for the purpose of resolving finally the issue of paternity. If the test results indicate a 99% or higher probability of paternity, the
defendant shall be stipulated to be the biological father of the child and the case
referred for a child support conference. If the test results indicate an exclusion,
the action shall be dismissed. The written stipulation constitutes a waiver of the
right to a hearing on the genetic testing or trial on the issue of paternity.
(3) The conference officer shall advise and provide written notice to the
parties that if they do not enter into a written stipulation and the test results do
not indicate an exclusion, there will be a hearing regarding genetic testing or
trial before a judge without a jury on the issue of paternity in accordance with
the procedures set forth in subdivision (d) of this Rule.
(c) Estoppel and Presumption of Paternity. If either party or the court raises
the issue of estoppel or the issue of whether the presumption of paternity is
applicable, the court shall dispose promptly of the issue and may stay the order
for genetic testing until the issue is resolved.
(d) Post-Testing Procedures.
(1) The results of the genetic tests shall be provided in writing to counsel
for the parties or, if unrepresented, to the parties themselves.

(2) If the results of the genetic tests resolve the issue of paternity pursuant
to the stipulation of the parties, a paternity order shall be entered and served on
the parties. If the defendant is excluded, the action shall be dismissed. If the
defendant is stipulated to be the biological father, the action shall proceed as in
other actions for support.
(3) If the results of the genetic tests do not resolve the issue of paternity
pursuant to the stipulation of the parties, but the test results indicate a 99% or
more probability of paternity, the court shall issue a rule against the defendant
to show cause why an order should not be entered finding him to be the father.
The rule shall advise the defendant that pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S. § 4343 his
defense is limited to a showing by clear and convincing evidence that the
results of the genetic tests are not reliable. The rule shall direct that an answer
be filed within 20 days after service of the rule on the defendant. The answer
shall state the material facts which constitute this defense. Any allegation of
fact which does not appear of record must be verified.
If an answer is not timely filed, the court shall enter an order finding paternity
and refer the action to conference and hearing as in other actions for support. If
an answer is filed raising a disputed issue of material fact relating to the reliability of the genetic testing, the case shall be listed promptly for expedited hearing
before a judge. The burden of proof at the hearing is on the defendant and is limited to proof by clear and convincing evidence that the results of the genetic tests
are not reliable.
(4) If the results of the genetic tests do not resolve the issue of paternity
and the test results indicate less than a 99% probability of paternity, the case
shall be promptly listed for expedited trial before a judge.
(5) If, after a hearing or trial, the decision is for the defendant on the issue
of paternity, a final order shall be entered by the court dismissing the action as
to the child. If the decision is against the defendant on the issue of paternity,
an interlocutory order shall be entered by the court finding paternity. The court
may enter an interim order for child support at that time and shall refer the
action to conference and hearing as in other actions for support.
(e) Failure to Appear. If defendant fails to appear as ordered for a conference, hearing or trial, or for genetic tests, the court shall, upon proof of service
on the defendant, enter an order establishing paternity. The court may also enter
an interim order for child support at that time and shall refer the action to conference and hearing as in other actions for support.
(f) Appeal of Paternity Order. An order establishing paternity is not an
appealable order. The issue of paternity may be included in an appeal from the
final order of child support.

Rule 1910.16-1. Support Obligation. Support Guidelines.
(a) Applicability of the Support Guidelines.
(1) Except as provided in subdivision (a)(3), the support guidelines determine a spouse’s or parent’s support obligation based on the parties’ combined
monthly net income, as defined in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-2, and the number of
persons being supported.
(2) If a person caring for or having custody of a minor child, who does not
have a duty of support to the minor child, initiates a child support action as
provided in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.3:
(i) the complaint shall name the parents as defendants;
(ii) in determining the basic child support obligation, the monthly net
income for the individual initiating the action shall not be considered in the
support calculation by the trier-of-fact;
(iii) the parents’ monthly net incomes shall be combined to determine
the basic child support obligation, which shall be apportioned based on the
parents’ respective monthly net incomes consistent with Pa.R.C.P. No.
1910.16-4. The parents shall pay the obligee their proportionate share of the
basic child support obligation as a separate obligor; and
(iv) as with other support actions, the trier-of-fact may adjust or deviate
the basic child support, spousal support, or alimony pendente lite obligation
consistent with the support guidelines based on the evidence presented by the
parties.
Example 1. The parents have one child, who is in the custody
of the maternal grandmother. Maternal grandmother initiates a
support action against the parents. Mother’s monthly net
income is $3,000 and Father’s monthly net income is $2,000 for
a combined monthly net income of $5,000. For purposes of the
child support calculation, maternal grandmother’s income is
irrelevant and not part of the calculation. The basic child support obligation for one child at a combined monthly net income
of $5,000 is $993 per month. Mother’s percentage share of the
combined monthly net income is 60% ($3,000/$5,000) and
Father’s percentage share of the combined monthly net income
is 40% ($2,000/$5,000). Mother’s preliminary monthly share of
the child support obligation is $596 ($993 × 60%) and Father’s
preliminary monthly share of the child support obligation is
$397 ($993 × 40%). Maternal grandmother is the obligee with
Mother and Father as separate obligors owing $596 and $397,
respectively, to the maternal grandmother.
(3) In an action in which the plaintiff is a public body or private agency
pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.3, the basic child support obligation shall be
231 Rule 1910.16 GENERAL
1910-18
(407042) No. 566 Jan. 22 Copyright  2022 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
calculated under the guidelines based upon the parent’s monthly net income
with the public or private entity’s monthly net income as zero. In such cases,
each parent shall be treated as a separate obligor, and the parent’s obligation
will be based upon the parent’s monthly net income without regard to the other
parent’s monthly net income.
(i) The basic child support obligation owed to a child not in placement
shall be deducted from each parent’s monthly net income before calculating
support for the child in placement, including the direct support the support
guidelines assume the custodial parent will provide.
Example 2. The parents have three children and do not live in
the same household. Mother has primary custody of two children and monthly net income of $2,500 per month. Father’s
monthly net income is $4,000. The parties’ third child is in foster care placement. Pursuant to the schedule in Pa.R.C.P. No.
1910.16-3, the basic child support obligation for the two children with Mother is $1,733. As Father’s income is 62% of the
parties’ combined monthly net income, Father’s basic child support obligation to Mother is $1,074 per month. The guidelines
assume that Mother will provide $659 per month in direct
expenditures to the two children. The agency/obligee brings an
action against each parent for the support of the child in placement. Father/obligor’s monthly net income will be $2,926 for
purposes of this calculation ($4,000 less $1,074 in support for
the children with Mother). As the agency/obligee’s income is
zero, Father’s support for the child in placement will be 100%
of the basic child support obligation for one child at the $2,926
income level, or $674 per month. Mother/obligor’s net income
will be $1,841 for purposes of this calculation ($2,500 less
$659 in direct support to the children in Mother’s custody).
Mother’s support obligation will be 100% of the basic child
support obligation for one child at that income level, or $423
per month.
Example 3. The parents have two children in placement. Father
owes child support of $500 per month for two children of a
former marriage. At the same income levels as in Example 2,
Father’s monthly net income for determining his obligation to
the children in placement would be $3,500 ($4,000 less $500
support for two children of prior marriage). Father’s obligation
to the agency would be $1,205 per month (100% of the basic
child support obligation for two children at the $3,500 per
month income level). Mother’s monthly net income would not
be diminished as she owes no other child support. Mother
would owe $877 for the children in placement (100% of the
basic child support obligation for two children at the $2,500
income level).
(ii) If the parents reside in the same household, each parent’s respective
basic child support obligation to a child that remains in the household and is
not in placement shall be calculated according to the guidelines, with the
parent having the higher income as the obligor, and the calculated basic child
ACTIONS FOR SUPPORT 231 Rule 1910.16-1
1910-19
(407043) No. 566 Jan. 22
support obligation shall be deducted from the parents’ monthly net incomes
for purposes of calculating support for a child in placement.
Example 4. The parents have four children, two of whom are in
placement. Mother’s monthly net income is $4,000 and Father’s
is $3,000. The basic child support obligation for the two children in the home is $1,841, according to the schedule in
Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3. As Mother’s monthly net income is
57% of the parties’ combined monthly net income, her share
would be $1,049, and Father’s 43% share would be $792.
Mother’s monthly net income for purposes of calculating support for the two children in placement would be $2,951 ($4,000
less $1,049). She would pay 100% of the basic child support
obligation at that income level, or $1,026, for the children in
placement. Father’s monthly net income would be $2,208
($3,000 less $792), and his obligation to the children in placement would be $772.
(iii) If the basic child support obligation exceeds the placement’s cost,
the trier-of-fact shall:
(A) deviate the basic child support obligation downward; and
(B) apply the parent’s percentage of the combined monthly net income
to the reduced basic child support obligation.
(4) The support of a spouse or child is a priority obligation so that a party
is expected to meet this obligation by adjusting the party’s other expenditures.
(b) Support Obligation. The support obligation (child support, spousal support, or alimony pendente lite) awarded pursuant to the Pa.R.C.P. Nos. 1910.11
and 1910.12 procedures shall be determined in accordance with the support
guidelines, which consist of the guidelines expressed as the basic child support
schedule in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3, the Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-4 formulas, and
the operation of the support guidelines as set forth in these rules.
(c) Spousal Support and Alimony Pendente Lite.
(1) Spousal support and alimony pendente lite orders shall not be in effect
simultaneously.
(2) In determining a spousal support or alimony pendente lite obligation’s
duration, the trier-of-fact shall consider the marriage’s duration, i.e., the date of
marriage to the date of final separation.
(d) Rebuttable Presumption. If the trier-of-fact determines that a party has a
duty to pay support, there is a rebuttable presumption that the guidelinecalculated support obligation is the correct support obligation.
(1) The presumption is rebutted if the trier-of-fact concludes in a written
finding or states on the record that the guideline support obligation is unjust or
inappropriate.
(2) The trier-of-fact shall consider the child’s and parties’ special needs and
obligations, and apply the Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-5 deviation factors, as appropriate.
(e) Support Guidelines Review. The support guidelines shall be reviewed at
least every four years to ensure that their application determines the appropriate
support obligation.

Explanatory Comment—2010
Introduction. Pennsylvania law requires that child and spousal support be awarded pursuant to a
statewide guideline. 23 Pa.C.S. § 4322(a). That statute further provides that the guideline shall be
‘‘established by general rule by the Supreme Court, so that persons similarly situated shall be treated
similarly.’’ Id.
Pursuant to federal law, The Family Support Act of 1988 (P. L. 100-485, 102 Stat. 2343 (1988), all
states are required to have statewide child support guidelines. Federal regulations, 45 CFR 302.56,
further require that the guidelines be reviewed at least once every four years and that such reviews
include an assessment of the most recent economic data on child-rearing costs and a review of data
from case files to assure that deviations from the guidelines are limited. The Pennsylvania statute also
requires a review of the support guidelines every four years. 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 4322(a).
The Domestic Relations Procedural Rules Committee of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania began
the mandated review process in early 2007. The committee was assisted in its work by Jane Venohr,
Ph.D., an economist with the Center for Policy Research, under contract between the Pennsylvania
Department of Public Welfare and Policy Studies, Inc. As a result of the review, the committee recommended to the Supreme Court several amendments to the statewide guidelines.
A. Income Shares Model. Pennsylvania’s child support guidelines are based upon the Income
Shares Model. That model was developed under the Child Support Guidelines Project funded by the
U.S. Office of Child Support Enforcement and administered by the National Center for State Courts.
The Guidelines Project Advisory Group recommended the Income Shares Model for state guidelines.
At present, 37 states use the Income Shares Model as a basis for their child support guidelines.
The Income Shares Model is based upon the concept that the child of separated, divorced or nevermarried parents should receive the same proportion of parental income that she or he would have
received if the parents lived together. A number of authoritative economic studies provide estimates
of the average amount of household expenditures for children in intact households. These studies
show that the proportion of household spending devoted to children is directly related to the level of
household income and to the number of the children. The basic support amounts reflected in the
schedule in Rule 1910.16-3 represent average marginal expenditures on children for food, housing,
transportation, clothing and other miscellaneous items that are needed by children and provided by
their parents, including the first $250 of unreimbursed medical expenses incurred annually per child.
1. Economic Measures. The support schedule in Rule 1910.16-3 is based upon child-rearing expenditures measured by David M. Betson, Ph.D., Professor of Economics, University of Notre Dame. Dr.
Betson’s measurements were developed for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for
the explicit purpose of assisting states with the development and revision of child support guidelines.
Dr. Betson’s research also was used in developing the prior schedule, effective in January 2006. Dr.
Betson updates his estimates using data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey conducted by the
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. In the current schedule, those figures were converted to 2008 price
levels using the Consumer Price Index.
2. Source of Data. The estimates used to develop the schedule are based upon national data. The
specific sources of the data are the periodic Consumer Expenditure Surveys. Those national surveys
are used because they are the most detailed available source of data on household expenditures. The
depth and quality of this information is simply not available at the state level and would be prohibitively costly to gather.
The U. S. Department of Agriculture’s Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion (‘‘CNPP’’) also
develops economic estimates for the major categories of child-rearing expenditures. Although the
committee reviewed these estimates, it is aware of only one state that relies upon the CNPP estimates
as a basis for its child support schedule, and even that state makes certain adjustments.

1910-21
(395607) No. 533 Apr. 19
B. Statutory Considerations. The Pennsylvania statute, 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 4322(a), provides:
Child and spousal support shall be awarded pursuant to a Statewide guideline as established
by general rule by the Supreme Court, so that persons similarly situated shall be treated similarly. The guideline shall be based upon the reasonable needs of the child or spouse seeking
support and the ability of the obligor to provide support. In determining the reasonable needs
of the child or spouse seeking support and the ability of the obligor to provide support, the
guideline shall place primary emphasis on the net incomes and earning capacities of the parties, with allowable deviations for unusual needs, extraordinary expenses and other factors,
such as the parties’ assets, as warrant special attention. The guideline so developed shall be
reviewed at least once every four years.
1. Reasonable Needs and Reasonable Ability to Provide Support. The guidelines make financial
support of a child a primary obligation and assume that parties with similar net incomes will have
similar reasonable and necessary expenses. After the basic needs of the parents have been met, the
child’s needs shall receive priority. The guidelines assume that if the obligor’s net income is at the
poverty level, he or she is barely able to provide for his or her own basic needs. In those cases, therefore, the entry of a minimal order may be appropriate after considering the party’s living expenses.
In some cases, it may not be appropriate to enter a support order at all. In most cases, however, a
party’s living expenses are not relevant in determining his or her support obligation. Rather, as the
statute requires, the obligation is based upon the reasonable needs of a dependent spouse or child and
the reasonable ability of the obligor to pay.
2. Net Income. The guidelines use the net incomes of the parties. Each parent is required to contribute a share of the child’s reasonable needs in proportion to that parent’s share of the combined net
income. The custodial parent makes these contributions through direct expenditures for food, shelter,
clothing, transportation and other reasonable needs. The non-custodial parent makes contributions
through periodic support payments to the custodial parent. Rule 1910.16-2(d) has been amended to
clarify the provisions relating to income and earning capacity.
3. Allowable Deviations. The guidelines are designed to treat similarly situated parents, spouses
and children in the same manner. However, when there are unavoidable differences, deviations must
be made from the guidelines. Failure to deviate from these guidelines by considering a party’s actual
expenditures where there are special needs and special circumstances constitutes a misapplication of
the guidelines.
C. Child Support Schedule. The child support schedule in Rule 1910.16-3 has been amended to
reflect updated economic data, as required by federal and state law, to ensure that children continue
to receive adequate levels of support. The support amounts in the schedule have been expanded to
apply to a combined net monthly income of $30,000 and remain statistically valid. The economic data
support the revised schedule.
D. Self-Support Reserve (‘‘SSR’’). The amended schedule also incorporates an increase in the
‘‘Self-Support Reserve’’ or ‘‘SSR’’ from $748 per month to $867 per month, the 2008 federal poverty
level for one person. Formerly designated as the ‘‘Computed Allowance Minimum’’ or ‘‘CAM,’’ the
Self-Support Reserve, as it is termed in most other states’ guidelines, is intended to assure that lowincome obligors retain sufficient income to meet their own basic needs, as well as to maintain the
incentive to continue employment. The SSR is built into the schedule in Rule 1910.16-3 and adjusts
the basic support obligation to prevent the obligor’s net income from falling below $867 per month.
Because the schedule in Rule 1910.16-3 applies to child support only, Rule 1910.16-2(e)(1)(B) provides for a similar adjustment in spousal support and alimony pendente lite cases to assure that the
obligor retains a minimum of $867 per month.
E. Shared Custody. In creating the new schedule, the amounts of basic child support were first
increased to reflect updated economic data, including 2008 price levels. Next, the amounts of basic
child support were adjusted to incorporate into the schedule the assumption that the children spend
231 Rule 1910.16-1 GENERAL
1910-22
(395608) No. 533 Apr. 19 Copyright  2019 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
30% of the time with the obligor and that the obligor makes direct expenditures on their behalf during that time. That does not mean that the entire schedule was reduced by 30%. Only those variable
expenditures, such as food and entertainment, that fluctuate based upon parenting time were adjusted.
The calculation in Rule 1910.16-4(c) reduces an obligor’s support obligation further if the obligor
spends significantly more time with the children. The revised schedule assumes that the obligor has
30% parenting time. The obligor will receive an additional 10% reduction in the amount of support
owed at 40% parenting time, increasing incrementally to a 20% reduction at 50% parenting time. This
method may still result in a support obligation even if custody of the children is equally shared. In
those cases, the rule provides for a maximum obligation which may reduce the obligation so that the
obligee does not receive a larger portion of the parties’ combined income than the obligor.
F. Child Care Expenses. Rule 1910.16-6(a) was amended in 2006 to provide that child care
expenses incurred by both parties shall be apportioned between the parties in recognition of the fact
that a non-custodial parent also may incur such expenses during his or her custodial periods with the
children.
G. Spousal Support and Alimony Pendente Lite. Subdivision (c) has been amended to require the
court to consider the duration of the marriage in determining the duration of a spousal support or alimony pendente lite award. The language was moved from Rule 1910.16-5 which deals with deviation. The primary purpose of this provision is to prevent the unfairness that arises in a short-term
marriage when the obligor is required to pay support over a substantially longer period of time than
the parties were married and there is little or no opportunity for credit for these payments at the time
of equitable distribution.
H. Other Amendments. All of the examples in the guidelines have been updated to reflect the
changes to the basic child support schedule. Prior explanatory comments have been deleted or revised
and incorporated into new comments.
Explanatory Comment—2013
The schedule of basic child support has been updated to reflect newer economic data. The schedule was prepared by Jane Venohr, Ph.D., the economist who assisted in the last guideline review using
the same methodology. It includes an increase in the Self-Support Reserve to $931 per month, the
2012 federal poverty level for one person.
Explanatory Comment—2017
Pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.3(a), a person having custody of a child or caring for a child may
initiate a support action against the child’s parent(s). Previously, this rule only addressed when a public body or private agency had custody of a child but was silent with regard to an individual third
party, e.g., grandparent, seeking support. The rule has been amended by adding a new subdivision
(a)(2) and renumbering the previous (a)(2) to (a)(3). In addition, an example illustrating the new (a)(2)
calculation has been included.
Subdivision (a)(2) excludes the income of the third party/obligee, as that person does not have a
duty of support to the child; instead, the rule uses the combined monthly net income of the parents
to determine the basic child support amount, which is then apportioned between the parents consistent with their respective percentage of the combined monthly net income in the same manner as a
parent vs. parent support action. However, under this rule, each parent would be a separate obligor,
would pay the obligee their proportionate share under a separate support order, and would be subject
to separate enforcement proceedings. Under (a)(2), the exclusion of the third party’s income is consistent with Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-2(b)(2)(ii) as that rule relates to an action for support by a third
party against a surviving parent in which the child receives a Social Security derivative benefit due
to the death of the other parent.

Rule 1910.16-2. Support Guidelines. Calculation of Monthly Net Income.
Generally, the basic child support, spousal support, or alimony pendente lite
obligation is based on the parties’ monthly net incomes.
(a) Monthly Gross Income. Monthly gross income is ordinarily based on at
least a six-month average of a party’s income. The support law, 23 Pa.C.S.
§ 4302, defines the term ‘‘income’’ and includes income from any source. The
statute lists many types of income including, but not limited to:
(1) wages, salaries, bonuses, fees, and commissions;
(2) net income from business or dealings in property;
(3) interest, rents, royalties, and dividends;
(4) pensions and all forms of retirement;
(5) income from an interest in an estate or trust;
(6) Social Security disability benefits, Social Security retirement benefits,
temporary and permanent disability benefits, workers’ compensation, and
unemployment compensation;
(7) alimony if, in the trier-of-fact’s discretion, inclusion of part or all of it
is appropriate; and
(8) other entitlements to money or lump sum awards, without regard to
source, including:
(i) lottery winnings;
(ii) income tax refunds;
(iii) insurance compensation or settlements;
(iv) awards and verdicts; and
(v) payments due to and collectible by an individual regardless of
source.
(b) Treatment of Public Assistance, SSI Benefits, Social Security Payments to
a Child Due to a Parent’s Death, Disability or Retirement, and Foster Care Payments.
231 Rule 1910.16-2 GENERAL
1910-24
(421224) No. 603 Feb. 25 Copyright  2025 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
(1) Public Assistance and SSI Benefits. Neither public assistance nor
Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits shall be included as income for
determining support.
(2) Child’s Social Security Derivative Benefits.
(i) If a child is receiving Social Security derivative benefits due to a
parent’s retirement or disability:
(A) The trier-of-fact shall determine the basic child support obligation
as follows:
(I) add the child’s benefit to the monthly net income of the party
who receives the child’s benefit;
(II) calculate the parties’ combined monthly net income, including
the child’s benefit;
(III) determine the basic child support obligation set forth in the
Pa.R.Civ.P. 1910.16-3 schedule; and
(IV) apportion the basic child support obligation between the parties based on the party’s percentage of the combined monthly net
income.
(B) If the obligee receives the child’s benefit, the trier-of-fact shall
deduct the child’s benefit from the basic child support obligation of the
party whose retirement or disability created the child’s benefit.
(C) If the obligor receives the child’s benefit, the trier-of-fact shall not
deduct the child’s benefit from the obligor’s basic child support obligation,
even if the obligor’s retirement or disability created the child’s benefit. To
illustrate for the parties the impact of the obligor receiving the benefit
instead of the obligee, the trier-of-fact shall provide the parties with two
calculations theoretically assigning the benefit to each household.
(D) The trier-of-fact shall allocate the expenses in Pa.R.Civ.P.
1910.16-6(a)—(e) based on the parties’ monthly net incomes without considering the child’s benefit.
(E) In equally shared custody cases, the party with the higher monthly
net income, excluding the child’s benefit, is the obligor.
(ii) If a child is receiving Social Security derivative benefits due to a
parent’s death, the trier-of-fact shall determine the surviving parent’s basic
child support obligation as follows:
(A) The non-parent obligee’s monthly net income shall include only
those funds the obligee is receiving on the child’s behalf, including the
Social Security derivative benefit.
(B) If the surviving-parent obligor receives the Social Security derivative benefit, the benefit shall be added to the parent’s monthly net income
to calculate child support.
(3) Foster Care Payments. If a party to a support action is a foster parent
or is receiving payments from a public or private agency for the care of a child
who is not the party’s biological or adoptive child, the trier-of-fact shall not
ACTIONS FOR SUPPORT 231 Rule 1910.16-2
1910-25
(421225) No. 603 Feb. 25
include those payments in the party’s monthly net income for purposes of calculating child support for the foster parent’s or other caretaker’s biological or
adoptive child.
(c) Monthly Net Income.
(1) Unless these rules provide otherwise, the trier-of-fact shall deduct only
the following items from monthly gross income to arrive at monthly net
income:
(i) federal, state, and local income taxes;
(ii) unemployment compensation taxes and Local Services Taxes (LST);
(iii) F.I.C.A. payments (Social Security, Medicare and Self-Employment
taxes) and non-voluntary retirement payments;
(iv) mandatory union dues; and
(v) alimony paid to the other party.
(2) In computing a spousal support or alimony pendente lite obligation, the
trier-of-fact shall:
(i) deduct from the obligor’s monthly net income child support, spousal support, alimony pendente lite, or alimony amounts paid to children and
former spouses, who are not part of this action; and
(ii) include in a party’s monthly net income alimony pendente lite or
alimony received from a former spouse that was not included in the party’s
gross income, as provided in subdivision (a).
(d) Reduced Income or Fluctuating Earnings.
(1) Voluntary Income Reduction—Existing Orders. The trier-of-fact shall
not downwardly adjust a party’s net income from an existing order if the trierof-fact finds that:
(i) the party’s income reduction resulted from the party willfully
attempting to favorably affect the party’s basic support obligation; or
(ii) the party voluntarily assumed a lower paying job, quit a job, left
employment, changed occupations, changed employment status to pursue an
education, or employment is terminated due to willful misconduct.
(2) Involuntary Income Reduction. Incarceration. Earnings Fluctuations—
Existing Orders.
(i) Involuntary Income Reduction. The trier-of-fact shall adjust a party’s monthly net income from an existing order for substantial continuing
involuntary decreases in income due to an employment situation over which
the party has no control, including, but not limited to, illness, lay-off, termination, or job elimination.
(ii) Incarceration.
(A) Except as set forth in subdivision (d)(2)(ii)(B), the trier-of-fact
shall:
(I) consider an incarcerated party’s income reduction as an involuntary income reduction as set forth in subdivision (d)(2)(i); and
231 Rule 1910.16-2 GENERAL
1910-26
(421226) No. 603 Feb. 25 Copyright  2025 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
(II) adjust the incarcerated party’s monthly net income accordingly.
(B) Exception.
(I) A party’s incarceration shall not constitute an involuntary
income reduction when the incarceration is due to support enforcement
purposes or a criminal offense in which the party’s dependent child or
the obligee was the victim; and
(II) The trier-of-fact makes a written finding that downwardly
adjusting the incarcerated party’s monthly net income would be unjust or
inappropriate and, in a child support action, takes into consideration the
child’s best interest.
(iii) Earnings Fluctuations. The trier-of-fact shall not adjust a party’s
monthly net income from an existing order due to normal or temporary earnings fluctuations.
(3) Seasonal Employees. Generally, the trier-of-fact shall base a seasonal
employee’s monthly net income on a yearly average.
(4) Earning Capacity—Initial Orders.
(i) When calculating an initial order, if a party willfully fails to obtain
or maintain appropriate employment, the trier-of-fact may impute to the party
an income equal to the party’s earning capacity.
(A) Earning Capacity Limitation. The trier-of-fact:
(I) shall not impute to the party an earning capacity that exceeds
the amount the party could earn from one full-time position; and
(II) shall determine a reasonable work regimen based upon the
party’s relevant circumstances, including the jobs available within a particular occupation, working hours and conditions, and whether a party
has exerted substantial good faith efforts to find employment.
(B) The trier-of-fact shall base the party’s earning capacity on the subdivision (d)(4)(ii) factors.
(C) After assessing a party’s earning capacity, the trier-of-fact shall
state the reasons for the assessment in writing or on the record.
(D) When the trier-of-fact imputes an earning capacity to a party who
would incur childcare expenses if the party were employed, the trierof-fact shall consider reasonable childcare responsibilities and expenses
for the purpose of discretionary allocation pursuant to Pa.R.Civ.P.
1910.16-6(a)(1)(ii).
(ii) Factors. In determining a party’s earning capacity, the trier-of-fact
shall consider the party’s:
(A) child care responsibilities and expenses;
(B) assets;
(C) residence;
(D) employment and earnings history;
(E) job skills;
ACTIONS FOR SUPPORT 231 Rule 1910.16-2

(F) educational attainment;
(G) literacy;
(H) age;
(I) health;
(J) criminal record and other employment barriers;
(K) record of seeking work;
(L) local job market, including the availability of employers who are
willing to hire the party;
(M) local community prevailing earnings level; and
(N) other relevant factors.
(e) Net Income Affecting Application of the Support Guidelines.
(1) Low-Income Cases.
(i) Self-Support Reserve (SSR).
(A) The SSR is the minimum monthly net income reserved to the obligor to meet the obligor’s basic needs.
(B) The SSR amount is $1,063 per month.
(ii) Action for Child Support Only. When the obligor’s monthly net
income and the number of children in the action intersect in the Basic Child
Support Schedule’s shaded area as set forth in Pa.R.Civ.P. 1910.16-3, the
trier-of-fact shall determine the obligor’s basic child support obligation utilizing the lesser of the two calculated amounts from the following methodologies.
(A) The initial calculation is determined by using the obligor’s
monthly net income only, the schedule set forth in Pa.R.Civ.P. 1910.16-3,
and the number of children.
(B) The second calculation is determined by using the parties’ combined monthly net income and the basic child support formula in
Pa.R.Civ.P. 1910.16-4(a).
(C) If the obligor’s monthly net income is at or below the SSR, the
trier-of-fact may award support only after consideration of the parties’
actual financial resources and living expenses.
(iii) Action for Spousal Support/Alimony Pendente Lite Only.
(A) After calculating the spousal support or alimony pendente lite obligation as provided in Pa.R.Civ.P. 1910.16-4, the spousal support obligation
shall not reduce the obligor’s monthly net income below the SSR.
(B) If the obligor’s monthly net income after subtracting the spousal
support or alimony pendente lite obligation is less than the SSR, the trierof-fact shall adjust the spousal support or alimony pendente lite obligation
downward by an amount sufficient for the obligor to retain the SSR
amount.
(iv) Action with Child Support and Spousal Support or Alimony Pendente Lite.
231 Rule 1910.16-2 GENERAL
1910-28
(421228) No. 603 Feb. 25 Copyright  2025 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
(A) The trier-of-fact shall calculate the spousal support or alimony
pendente lite obligation as provided in Pa.R.Civ.P. 1910.16-4.
(B) The trier-of-fact shall subtract the calculated spousal support or
alimony pendente lite obligation from the obligor’s monthly net income to
determine the obligor’s adjusted monthly net income.
(C) When the obligor’s adjusted monthly net income and the number
of children in the action intersect in the Basic Child Support Schedule’s
shaded area as set forth in Pa.R.Civ.P. 1910.16-3, the trier-of-fact:
(I) shall not award spousal support or alimony pendente lite; and
(II) shall calculate child support as provided in subdivision
(e)(1)(ii).
(D) When the obligor’s monthly net income and the number of children in the action do not intersect in the Basic Child Support Schedule’s
shaded area as set forth in Pa.R.Civ.P. 1910.16-3, the trier-of-fact shall calculate child support consistent with Pa.R.Civ.P. 1910.16-4.
(I) The combined spousal support or alimony pendente lite and
basic child support obligations shall not reduce the obligor’s remaining
monthly net income below the SSR.
(II) If the obligor’s monthly net income after subtracting the spousal support or alimony pendente lite and basic child support obligations
is less than the SSR, the trier-of-fact shall adjust the support obligation
downward by an amount sufficient for the obligor to retain the SSR
amount.
(2) High-Income Cases. If the parties’ combined monthly net income
exceeds $30,000, the trier-of-fact shall calculate child support, spousal support,
or alimony pendente lite pursuant to Pa.R.Civ.P. 1910.16-3.1.
(f) Child Tax Credit. In order to maximize the total income available to the
parties and children, the trier-of-fact may award, as appropriate, the federal child
tax credit to the non-custodial parent, or to either parent in cases of equally
shared custody, and require the other party to execute the waiver required by the
Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 152(e). The trier-of-fact shall consider the
tax consequences associated with the federal child tax credit in calculating the
party’s monthly net income available for support.
Comment:
Concerning subdivision (a)(7), in determining the appropriateness of including alimony in gross
income, the trier-of-fact shall consider whether the party receiving the alimony must include the
amount received as gross income when filing federal income taxes. If the alimony is not includable
in the party’s gross income for federal income tax purposes, the trier-of-fact may include in the party’s monthly net income the alimony received, as appropriate. See Pa.R.Civ.P. 1910.16-2(c)(2)(ii).
Since the reasons for ordering payment of alimony vary, the appropriateness of including it in the
recipient’s gross income must also vary. For example, if the obligor is paying $1,000 per month in
alimony for the express purpose of financing the obligee’s college education, it would be inappropriACTIONS FOR SUPPORT 231 Rule 1910.16-2
1910-29
(421229) No. 603 Feb. 25
ate to consider that alimony as income from which the obligee could provide child support. However,
if alimony is intended to finance the obligee’s general living expenses, inclusion of the alimony as
income is appropriate.
Concerning subdivision (a)(8), the trier-of-fact determines the most appropriate method for imputing lump-sum awards as income for purposes of establishing or modifying the party’s support obligation. These awards may be annualized or averaged over a shorter or longer period depending on the
case’s circumstances. The trier-of-fact may require all or part of the lump sum award escrowed to
secure the support obligation during that period.
The trier-of-fact shall not include income tax refunds in a party’s income, if the trier-of-fact factored in the tax refund when calculating the party’s actual tax obligation and monthly net income.
Concerning subdivision (b), care must be taken to distinguish Social Security from Supplemental
Security Income (SSI) benefits. Social Security benefits are income pursuant to subdivision (a).
Subdivision (b) Example 1. The obligor has monthly net income of $2,000. The obligee’s monthly
net income is $1,500 and the obligee, as primary custodial parent of the parties’ two children, receives
$700 per month in Social Security derivative benefits on behalf of the children as a result of the obligor’s disability. Add the children’s benefit to the obligee’s income, which now is $2,200 per month.
At the parties’ combined monthly net income of $4,200, the basic child support obligation for two
children is $1,372. As the obligor’s income is 48% of the parties’ combined monthly net income, the
obligor’s preliminary share of the basic child support obligation is $659. However, because the obligor’s disability created the children’s Social Security derivative benefits that the obligee is receiving,
the obligor’s obligation is reduced by the amount of the benefit, $700. As the support obligation cannot be less than zero, the obligor’s basic child support obligation is $0 per month. If it were the obligee’s disability that created the benefit, the obligor’s basic child support obligation would remain
$659. If the obligor were receiving the children’s benefit as a result of the obligor’s retirement or disability, the obligor’s monthly net income would include the amount of the benefit and total $2,700,
or 64% of the parties’ combined monthly net income. The obligor’s share of the basic child support
obligation would then be $878 and would not be reduced by the amount of the children’s benefit
because the obligor, not the obligee, is receiving the benefit. Therefore, the obligor’s basic child support obligation is less if the obligee is receiving the benefit created by the obligor.
Subdivision (b) Example 2. Two children live with Grandmother who receives $800 per month in
Social Security death benefits for the children as a result of Father’s death. Grandmother also receives
$500 per month from a trust established by Father for the benefit of the children. Grandmother is
employed and earns $2,000 net per month. Grandmother seeks support from the children’s mother,
who earns $2,000 net per month. For purposes of calculating Mother’s basic child support obligation,
Grandmother’s income will be $1,300, the amount she receives on the children’s behalf in Social
Security derivative benefits and the trust income. (If Mother were receiving the benefit on the children’s behalf, the benefit would be added to Mother’s monthly net income and would be $2,800.
Grandmother’s monthly net income would be $500.) Therefore, Mother’s and Grandmother’s combined monthly net income totals $3,300. The basic child support obligation at the $3,300 monthly net
income level for two children is $1,137. As Mother’s monthly net income of $2,000 is 61% of the
parties’ combined monthly net income of $3,300, Mother’s basic child support obligation is $694.
Since Mother’s retirement or disability did not generate the child’s derivative benefit, the benefit
amount is not subtracted from Mother’s basic child support obligation, and Mother owes Grandmother
$694. If Grandmother was not receiving the children’s derivative benefits or trust income, Grandmother’s monthly net income for purposes of calculating Mother’s basic child support obligation would be
zero, and Mother would pay 100% of the basic child support obligation because Grandmother has no
duty to support the children.
Concerning subdivision (c)(1)(v), because the reasons for ordering payment of alimony vary, the
appropriateness of including it in the recipient’s monthly net income must also vary. For example, if
231 Rule 1910.16-2 GENERAL
1910-30
(421230) No. 603 Feb. 25 Copyright  2025 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
the obligor is paying $1,000 per month in alimony for the express purpose of financing the obligee’s
college education, it would be inappropriate to consider that alimony as income from which the obligee could provide child support. However, if alimony is intended to finance the obligee’s general living expenses, inclusion of the alimony as income is appropriate.
The consideration of child care expenses if the party were employed in subdivision (d)(4)(i)(D) is
not for purposes of reducing imputed income when calculating the party’s basic child support obligation. The child care expenses that would be payable if a party were employed are subject
to discretionary allocation pursuant to Pa.R.Civ.P. 1910.16-6(a)(1)(ii).
Concerning subdivision (d)(4)(ii), see 45 C.F.R. § 302.56(c)(1)(iii) regarding earning capacity factors.
Subdivision (e)(1)(ii) Example: The parties have two children. The obligee has monthly net income
of $2,500. The obligor has monthly net income of $1,500, which falls into the shaded area of the
schedule for two children. The initial calculation is made using only the obligor’s monthly net income.
The basic child support obligation for two children would be $397. The second calculation uses the
parties’ combined monthly net income. The parties’ combined monthly net income is $4,000. The
basic child support obligation for two children is $1,340. The obligor’s proportionate share of the parties’ combined monthly net income is 38% with a basic child support obligation of $509. The obligor’s basic child support obligation using only the obligor’s monthly net income is less than the calculated amount using the parties’ combined monthly net income. As a result, the trier-of-fact should
award the lesser amount, and the obligor’s basic child support obligation is $397.
Subdivision (e)(1)(iii) Example: The obligor has $1,200 monthly net income, and the obligee has
$300 monthly net income. The formula in Pa.R.Civ.P. 1910.16-4(a)(1)(Part B) would result in a
monthly spousal support obligation of $276 (($1,200 × 33% = $396) minus ($300 × 40% = $120) for
a total of $276)). Since this amount leaves the obligor with only $924 per month, the trier-of-fact
should adjust the support obligation so the obligor retains at least $1,063 per month. Therefore, the
spousal support obligation is $137 per month ($1,200  $1,063).
Subdivision (e)(1)(iv) Example: Obligor and obligee have monthly net incomes of $2,000 and
$165, respectively, and have two children. Calculating spousal support under subdivision (e)(1)(iv)(A)
results in a spousal support obligation of $450 ($2,000 × 25% minus $165 × 30%). Obligor’s adjusted
monthly net income ($2,000 minus $450) is $1,550. Obligor’s adjusted monthly net income of $1,550
with two children is in the shaded area of the Basic Child Support Schedule, and as a result, the trierof-fact shall not award spousal support. Instead, the trier-of-fact should award child support only as
provided in subdivision (e)(1)(ii).
Concerning subdivision (e)(2), see Hanrahan v. Bakker, 186 A.3d 958 (Pa. 2018).
Historical Commentary
The following commentary is historical in nature and represents statements of the Committee at the
time of rulemaking:
Explanatory Comment—2010
Subdivision (a) addresses gross income for purposes of calculating the support obligation by reference to the statutory definition at 23 Pa.C.S. § 4322. Subdivision (b) provides for the treatment of
public assistance, SSI benefits, Social Security derivative benefits, and foster care payments.
Subdivision (c) sets forth the exclusive list of the deductions that may be taken from gross income
in arriving at a party’s net income. When the cost of health insurance premiums is treated as an additional expense subject to allocation between the parties under Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-6, it is not
deductible from gross income. However, part or all of the cost of health insurance premiums may be
deducted from the obligor’s gross income pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-6(b) in cases in which
the obligor is paying the premiums and the obligee has no income or minimal income. Subdivision
ACTIONS FOR SUPPORT 231 Rule 1910.16-2
1910-31
(421231) No. 603 Feb. 25
(c) relates to spousal support or alimony pendente lite awards when there are multiple families. In
these cases, a party’s monthly net income must be reduced to account for his or her child support
obligations, as well as any pre-existing spousal support, alimony pendente lite or alimony obligations
being paid to former spouses who are not the subject of the support action.
Subdivision (d) has been amended to clarify the distinction between voluntary and involuntary
changes in income and the imputing of earning capacity. Statutory provisions at 23 Pa.C.S. § 4322,
as well as case law, are clear that a support obligation is based upon the ability of a party to pay, and
that the concept of an earning capacity is intended to reflect a realistic, rather than a theoretical, ability to pay support. Amendments to subdivision (d) are intended to clarify when imposition of an earning capacity is appropriate.
Subdivision (e) has been amended to reflect the updated schedule in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3 and
the increase in the Self-Support Reserve (‘‘SSR’’). The schedule now applies to all cases in which the
parties’ combined monthly net income is $30,000 or less. The upper income limit of the prior schedule was only $20,000. The support amount at each income level of the schedule also has changed, so
the examples in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-2 were revised to be consistent with the new support amounts.
The SSR is intended to assure that obligors with low incomes retain sufficient income to meet their
basic needs and to maintain the incentive to continue employment. When the obligor’s monthly net
income or earning capacity falls into the shaded area of the schedule, the basic child support obligation can be derived directly from the schedule in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3. There is no need to use
the formula in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-4 to calculate the obligor’s support obligation because the SSR
keeps the amount of the obligation the same regardless of the obligee’s income. The obligee’s income
may be a relevant factor, however, in determining whether to deviate from the basic guideline obligation pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-5 and in considering whether to require the obligor to contribute to any additional expenses under Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-6.
Since the schedule in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3 sets forth basic child support only, subdivision
(e)(1)(ii) is necessary to reflect the operation of the SSR in spousal support and alimony pendente lite
cases. It adjusts the basic guideline obligation, which would otherwise be calculated under the formula in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-4, so that the obligor’s income does not fall below the SSR amount in
these cases.
Previously, the SSR required that the obligor retain at least $748 per month. The SSR now requires
that the obligor retain income of at least $867 per month, an amount equal to the 2008 federal poverty level for one person. When the obligor’s monthly net income is less than $867, subdivision
(e)(1)(iii) provides that the trier-of-fact must consider the parties’ actual living expenses before
awarding support. The guidelines assume that at this income level the obligor is barely able to meet
basic personal needs. In these cases, therefore, entry of a minimal order may be appropriate. In some
cases, it may not be appropriate to order support at all.
The schedule at Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3 sets forth the presumptive amount of basic child support
to be awarded. If the circumstances warrant, the trier-of-fact may deviate from that amount under
Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-5 and may also consider a party’s contribution to additional expenses, which
are typically added to the basic amount of support under Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-6. If, for example,
the obligor earns only $900 per month but is living with his or her parents, or has remarried and is
living with a fully-employed spouse, the trier-of-fact may consider an upward deviation under
Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-5(b)(3) or may order the party to contribute to the additional expenses under
Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-6. Consistent with the goals of the SSR, however, the trier-of-fact should
ensure that the overall support obligation leaves the obligor with sufficient income to meet basic personal needs and to maintain the incentive to continue working so that support can be paid.
Subdivision (e) also has been amended to eliminate the application of Melzer v. Witsberger, 480
A.2d 991 (Pa. 1984), in high-income child support cases. In cases in which the parties’ combined net
231 Rule 1910.16-2 GENERAL
1910-32
(421232) No. 603 Feb. 25 Copyright  2025 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
monthly income exceeds $30,000, child support will be calculated in accordance with the three-step
process in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3.1(a).
Explanatory Comment—2013
The SSR has been increased to $931, the 2012 federal poverty level for one person. Subdivision
(e) has been amended to require that when the obligor’s income falls into the shaded area of the basic
child support schedule in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3, two calculations must be performed. One calculation uses only the obligor’s income and the other is a regular calculation using both parties’ incomes,
awarding the lower amount to the obligee. The two-step process is intended to address those cases in
which the obligor has minimal income and the obligee’s income is substantially greater.
Explanatory Comment—2015
The rule has been amended to provide that a party’s support obligation will be reduced by the
child’s Social Security derivative benefit amount if that party’s retirement or disability created the
benefit and the benefit is being paid to the household in which the child primarily resides or the obligee in cases of equally shared custody. In most cases, payment of the benefit to the obligee’s household will increase the resources available to the child and the parties. The rule is intended to encourage parties to direct that the child’s benefits be paid to the obligee.
Explanatory Comment—2021
The Self-Support Reserve is determined by the Federal Poverty Guideline for one person converted
to a monthly amount—currently $1,063—for the year the Basic Child Support Schedule was derived.
Subdivision (e)(1) addresses low-income cases and has been completely rewritten and identifies the
current monthly Self-Support Reserve (SSR) amount as $1,063. The SSR is the amount of the obligor’s monthly net income that is reserved to meet the obligor’s basic needs. Subdivisions (e)(1)(ii)—
(iv) adjust the methodology for calculating support when the obligor’s monthly net income is at or
near the SSR amount.

Rule 1910.16-3. Support Guidelines. Basic Child Support Schedule.
The following schedule represents the amounts spent on children of intact
families by combined monthly net income and number of children. Combined
monthly net income is on the schedule’s vertical axis, and the number of children
is on the schedule’s horizontal axis. This schedule determines the basic child
support obligation. Unless these rules provide otherwise, the obligor’s basic child
support obligation shall be computed using either the formula set forth in
Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-4(a)(1)(Part C) or (a)(2)(Part I).

Explanatory Comment—2010
The basic child support schedule has been amended to reflect updated economic data. The schedule has been expanded to include all cases in which the
parties’ combined net monthly income is $30,000 or less. It also reflects an increase in the Self-Support Reserve to $867, the 2008 poverty level for one
person. The schedule was further adjusted to incorporate an assumption that the children spend 30% of the time with the obligor.
Explanatory Comment—2013
The basic child support schedule has been amended to reflect updated economic data. It also reflects an increase in the Self-Support Reserve to $931, the
2012 poverty level for one person, which has been incorporated into the schedule.
Explanatory Comment—2021
Previously, the Basic Child Support Schedule incorporated a 30% child custody presumption, which created approximately a 5% decrease in the basic
child support obligation across all combined monthly net incomes regardless of the actual custody schedule. The new Basic Child Support Schedule reflects
the actual expenses of an intact family living in a single household at the various combined monthly net incomes and the number of children with no shared
custody adjustment.
To the extent the parties share physical custody with the obligor having 40% or more of the annual overnights as set forth in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-4(c),
the formula in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-4(a)(1)(Part D) or (a)(2)(Part II) should be used to calculate the appropriate shared custody adjustment.

Rule 1910.16-3.1. Support Guidelines. High-Income Cases.
(a) Child Support.
(1) Presumptive Minimum Basic Child Support Obligation.
(i) The presumptive minimum basic child support obligation is the support obligation that the trier-of-fact would have awarded if the parties’ combined monthly net income was $30,000.
(ii) When the parties’ combined monthly net income exceeds $30,000,
the calculated support obligation shall not be less than the presumptive minimum basic child support obligation.
(2) High-Income Child Support Calculation. With the following three-step
process, the trier-of-fact shall calculate the total child support obligation.
(i) Preliminary Analysis. Using the following formula, the trier-of-fact
shall:
(A) calculate the basic child support obligation based on the parties’
combined monthly net income; and
(B) apportion the basic child support obligation based on the parties’
respective monthly net incomes.
One child: $3,608 + 4.0% of combined monthly net income above
$30,000.
Two children: $4,250 + 4.0% of combined monthly net income above
$30,000.
Three children: $4,951 + 4.7% of combined monthly net income above
$30,000.
Four children: $5,530 + 5.3% of combined monthly net income above
$30,000.
Five children: $6,083 + 5.8% of combined monthly net income above
$30,000.
Six children: $6,613 + 6.3% of combined monthly net income above
$30,000.
(ii) Substantial or Equally Shared Custody Adjustment. The trier-of-fact
shall adjust the basic child support obligation calculated in subdivision
(a)(2)(i) for substantial or equally shared custody as set forth in Pa.R.C.P.
No. 1910.16-4(c).
(iii) Final Analysis—Reasonable Needs.
(A) In determining the total child support obligation, the trier-of-fact
shall consider the child’s reasonable needs based on:
(I) the deviation factors in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-5;
(II) the additional expenses set forth in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-6;
and
(III) the parties’ expense statements required by Pa.R.C.P. No.
1910.11(c)(2) and Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.27(c)(2)(B).

(407093) No. 566 Jan. 22
(B) Subject to the presumptive minimum basic child support obligation, the trier-of-fact may upwardly or downwardly adjust the support
obligation calculated in subdivisions (a)(2)(i) and (ii) based on the child’s
reasonable needs.
(3) Final Order. As part of the final order, the trier-of-fact shall state on
the record or in writing:
(i) findings of fact; and
(ii) the reasons for awarding the total child support obligation, including:
(A) a discussion of the child’s reasonable needs; and
(B) the adjustments or deviations made to the basic child support obligation.
(b) Spousal Support or Alimony Pendente Lite.
(1) Preliminary Analysis. When the parties’ combined monthly net income
exceeds $30,000, the trier-of-fact shall apply the formula in either Pa.R.C.P.
No. 1910.16-4(a)(1)(Part B) or (a)(2)(Part IV) in calculating spousal support or
alimony pendente lite.
(2) Final Analysis. In determining the total spousal support or alimony
pendente lite obligation, the trier-of-fact shall consider:
(i) the deviation factors in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-5;
(ii) the additional expenses set forth in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-6; and
(iii) the parties’ expense statements required by Pa.R.C.P. No.
1910.11(c)(2) and Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.27(c)(2)(B).
(3) Final Order. As part of the final order, the trier-of-fact shall state on
the record or in writing:
(i) findings of fact; and
(ii) the reasons for awarding the final spousal support or alimony pendente lite obligation, including the adjustments or deviations made to the
basic spousal support or alimony pendente lite obligation.
Explanatory Comment—2010
Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3.1 is intended to bring all child support cases under the guidelines and treat
similarly situated parties similarly. Thus, high-income child support cases no longer will be decided
pursuant to Melzer v. Witsberger, 480 A.2d 991 (Pa. 1984). Economic data support the basic child
support schedule up to combined net incomes of $30,000 per month. Above that amount, economic
data are not readily available. Thus, for cases in which the parties’ combined monthly net income is
above $30,000, the formula first applies a fixed percentage to calculate the support amount. The formula is an extrapolation of the available economic data to high-income cases. Spousal support and
alimony pendente lite awards in high-income cases are preliminarily calculated pursuant to the formulas in either Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-4(a)(1)(Part B) or (2)(Part IV). However, in both high-income
child support and spousal support and high-income child support and alimony pendente lite cases, the
trier-of-fact is required to consider the factors in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-5 before entering a final order
and to make findings of fact on the record or in writing. Pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.11(c)(2), in
all high-income cases, the parties must submit an Income Statement and the Expense Statement at
Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.27(c)(2)(B) to enable the trier-of-fact to consider the factors in Pa.R.C.P. No.
1910.16-5.

The rule has been amended to clarify that the provisions of Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-4(c), regarding
support adjustments if the obligor has substantial or shared custody, apply in high-income cases. Previously, when high-income cases were decided pursuant to Melzer v. Witsberger, 480 A.2d 991 (Pa.
231 Rule 1910.16-3.1 GENERAL
1910-54.18
(407094) No. 566 Jan. 22 Copyright  2022 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
1984), case law held that because the time and resources each parent provided to a child were factored into the Melzer formula, the substantial or shared parenting time reductions did not apply to
cases decided pursuant to Melzer. See, e.g., Sirio v. Sirio, 951 A.2d 1188 (Pa. Super. 2008); Bulgarelli
v. Bulgarelli, 934 A.2d 107 (Pa. Super. 2007). As Melzer no longer applies to calculate support in
high-income cases, the prohibition against substantial or shared parenting time reductions in such
cases is no longer applicable.

Rule 1910.16-4. Support Guidelines. Calculation of Support Obligation,
Formula.
(a) The trier-of-fact shall use either the subdivision (1) or subdivision (2) formula to calculate the obligor’s share of basic child support, either from the
schedule in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3 or the formula in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-
3.1(a), as well as spousal support and alimony pendente lite obligations. In highincome cases, the trier-of-fact shall use either the subdivision (1)(Part B) or subdivision (2)(Part IV) formula, as appropriate, as a preliminary analysis in the
calculation of spousal support or alimony pendente lite obligations.
(1) The formula in Parts A through E is for an order entered on or after
January 1, 2019, or for a modification of an order entered before January 1,
2019 that includes spousal support or alimony pendente lite in which the
amendments to the Internal Revenue Code made by Section 11051 of the Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Pub.L. No. 115-97) expressly apply.
Official Note: Section 11051 of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Pub.L. No. 115-97)
amended the Internal Revenue Code by repealing the alimony deduction—the amount of spousal support, alimony pendente lite, and alimony paid or received—from the payor’s gross
income and the alimony inclusion into the payee’s gross income.
See subdivision (2) for a modification of an order entered before January 1, 2019 that
includes spousal support or alimony pendente lite in which the amendments to the Internal Revenue Code made by Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Pub.L. No. 115-97) do not apply to the
modification.

(b) Order For More Than Six Children. When there are more than six children who are the subject of a single support order, the trier-of-fact shall:

children;
(2) subtract the basic child support obligation for five children from the
basic child support obligation for six children;
(3) multiply the difference from subdivision (b)(2) by the number of children in excess of six; and
(4) add the amount from subdivision (b)(3) to the basic child support obligation for six children as determined in subdivision (b)(1).
(c) Substantial or Equally Shared Physical Custody.
(1) Substantial Physical Custody. When a child spends 40% or more of the
annual overnights with the obligor, a rebuttable presumption arises that the
obligor is entitled to a reduction in the basic child support obligation to reflect
the obligor’s increased direct spending on the child during the obligor’s custodial time.
ACTIONS FOR SUPPORT 231 Rule 1910.16-4
1910-54.27
(407103) No. 566 Jan. 22
(i) This rebuttable presumption also applies in high income cases
decided pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3.1.
(ii) Except as provided in subdivision (c)(2), the trier-of-fact shall calculate the adjustment pursuant to the formula set forth in subdivision
(a)(1)(Part D) or (a)(2)(Part II).
(2) Equally Shared Physical Custody. Without regard to which party initiated the support action, when a child spends an equal number of annual overnights with the parties:
(i) The formula in subdivision (a)(1)(Part D) or (a)(2)(Part II) cannot
be applied unless the obligor is the party with the higher monthly net income.
(ii) The trier-of-fact shall not require the party with the lower monthly
net income to pay basic child support to the party with the higher monthly
net income. However, this subdivision shall not preclude the entry of an
order requiring the party with less monthly net income to contribute to additional expenses pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-6.
(iii) Based upon the evidence presented, the trier-of-fact may enter a
support order against either party.
(iv) If the support calculation results in the obligee receiving a larger
share of the parties’ combined monthly net income, the trier-of-fact:
(A) shall adjust the obligor’s basic child support obligation so that the
combined monthly net income is allocated equally between the two parties;
and
(B) shall not award spousal support or alimony pendente lite.
Example 1. If the obligor and the obligee have monthly net
incomes of $5,000 and $2,300, respectively, the basic child
support obligation is $1,901 for two children. Using the income
shares formula in Part I, the obligor’s basic child support obligation is 68%, or $1,293. If the children spend 40% of the
annual overnights with the obligor, the formula in Part D or
Part II applies to reduce the obligor’s basic child support obligation to 58%, or $1,103. If the children spend 45% of the
annual overnights with the obligor, the obligor’s basic child
support obligation is reduced to 53%, or $1,008. If the children
spend an equal number of the annual overnights with the obligor and obligee, the obligor’s basic child support obligation is
reduced to 48%, or $912.
Example 2. Mother and Father have monthly net incomes of
$3,000 and $2,700, respectively. Mother has filed for support
for the parties’ two children with whom the parties share time
equally. As the parties have equal custody and Mother has the
higher monthly net income, Mother cannot be the obligee.
Although Mother initiated the support action, she would be the
obligor. Pursuant to the Basic Child Support Schedule in
231 Rule 1910.16-4 GENERAL
1910-54.28
(407104) No. 566 Jan. 22 Copyright  2022 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3, the basic child support obligation for
two children at the parties’ combined monthly net income is
$1,585 per month. Mother’s share is 53%, or $840. Application
of the Part II or Part D formula results in a 20% reduction in
support when the obligor has 50% custody of the children.
Mother’s adjusted percentage share of the basic support obligation is 33% (53%  20% = 33%) and the preliminary adjusted
basic child support obligation is $523 (33% of $1,585). However, as this amount would result in Father having a greater
share of the parties’ combined monthly net income ($3,223 vs.
$2,477), Mother’s basic child support obligation would be
adjusted to $150 per month to allocate the parties’ combined
monthly net income equally between the two parties and would
be the presumptive basic child support obligation payable to
Father under these circumstances.
Example 3. If the obligor and the obligee have monthly net
incomes of $3,000 and $2,500, respectively, the basic child
support obligation for two children is $1,567. The obligor’s
share is 55%, or $862 ($1,567 × 55%). If the children spend
equal time with the parties, the formula in Part II or Part D
results in a basic child support obligation of $548 ($1,567 ×
35%) payable to the obligee. Since this amount results in the
obligee having monthly net income of $3,048 and the obligor
having monthly net income of $2,452, the obligor’s basic child
support obligation would be adjusted to $250 to equalize the
combined monthly net income between the parties and would
be the presumptive basic child support obligation payable to the
obligee under these circumstances.
(d) Divided or Split Physical Custody. When Each Party Owes Child Support
to the Other Party. Varied Partial or Shared Custodial Schedules.
(1) Divided or Split Physical Custody. When Each Party Owes Child Support to the Other Party. When calculating a basic child support obligation and
each party owes child support to the other party as a result of the custodial
arrangement, the trier-of-fact shall offset the parties’ respective basic child support obligations and award the net difference to the obligee as child support.
Example 1. If the parties have three children, one child resides
with Mother and two children reside with Father, and the parties’ monthly net incomes are $4,000 and $2,000 respectively,
Mother’s basic child support obligation is calculated using the
schedule in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3 for two children at the
parties’ combined monthly net income of $6,000. The basic
child support obligation is $1,628. As Mother’s income is 67%
of the parties’ combined monthly net income, Mother’s basic
ACTIONS FOR SUPPORT 231 Rule 1910.16-4
1910-54.29
(407105) No. 566 Jan. 22
child support obligation for the two children living with Father
is $1,091. Father’s basic child support obligation is calculated
using the schedule in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3 for one child at
the parties’ combined monthly net income of $6,000. The basic
child support obligation is $1,097. Father’s basic child support
obligation for the child living with Mother is $362. Subtracting
$362 from $1,091 produces a basic child support obligation of
$729 payable to Father as child support.
Example 2. If the parties have two children, one child resides
with Mother and the parties equally share custody (50%
50%) of the other child, and the parties’ monthly net incomes
are as set forth in Example 1. The basic child support obligation is calculated using the schedule in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3
for the one child primarily residing with Mother at the parties’
combined monthly net income of $6,000, the basic child support obligation is $1,097. Father’s income is 33% of the parties’
combined monthly net income, and the basic child support obligation for the child living with Mother is $362. For Mother’s
obligation for the child with the equally shared custody
arrangement, using the schedule in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3 for
one child at the parties’ combined monthly net income of
$6,000, the basic child support obligation is $1,097. Mother’s
proportionate share of the combined monthly net incomes is
67%, but it is reduced to 47% after applying the shared parenting time adjustment for 50% custody under subdivision (c).
Mother’s basic child support obligation for the shared custody
child is $516 ($1,097 × 47%). As Mother’s obligation is greater
than Father’s obligation, Father is the obligee and receives the
net of the two obligations by subtracting $362 from $516, or
$154.
(2) Varied Partial or Shared Physical Custodial Schedule.
(i) The trier-of-fact may reduce a party’s basic child support obligation
when the parties have more than one child and each child spends either different amounts of:
(A) partial or equally shared custodial time with the higher monthly
net income party; or
(B) partial custodial time with the lower monthly net income party.
(ii) In determining whether a party is entitled to a reduction as provided
in subdivision (d)(2)(i):
(A) the trier-of-fact shall:
(I) add the percentage of annual overnights each child spends
with that party; and
231 Rule 1910.16-4 GENERAL
1910-54.30
(407106) No. 566 Jan. 22 Copyright  2022 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
(II) divide by the number of children to determine the party’s average percentage of custodial time.
(B) If the average percentage of custodial time is 40% or more:
(I) subdivision (c) applies; and
(II) the trier-of-fact shall reduce the party’s basic child support
obligation accordingly.
Example 1. The parties have two children and one child spends
50% of the annual overnights with Mother, who has the higher
monthly net income, and the other child spends 20% of the
annual overnights with Mother. Add those percentages together
and divide by the number of children (50% plus 20% = 70%
divided by 2 children = 35% average time with Mother). Pursuant to subdivision (d)(2)(ii)(B), Mother is not entitled to a
reduction in the support order for substantial parenting time.
Example 2. The parties have three children. Two children spend
50% of the annual overnights with Mother, who has the higher
monthly net income, and the third child spends 30% of the
annual overnights with Mother. Add the percentages of custodial time for all three children together and divide by the number of children (50% plus 50% plus 30% = 130% divided by
three children = 43.33% average percentage of time with
Mother). Pursuant to subdivision (d)(2)(ii)(B), Mother is
entitled to a reduction in the support order for substantial parenting time.
Example 3. The parties have three children, Mother has primary
custody (60%  40%) of one child, Father has primary custody
(60%  40%) of one child, and the parties share custody (50%
 50%) of the third child. The parties’ monthly net incomes are
$2,500 (Mother) and $2,000 (Father). As a result of the custodial arrangement, Father owes support for the child in the primary custody of Mother and Mother owes support for the child
in the primary custody of Father and for the child shared
equally between the parties. Father’s basic child support obligation is calculated using the schedule in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3
for one child at the parties’ combined monthly net income of
$4,500. The basic child support obligation is $941. Father’s
proportionate share of the combined monthly net incomes is
44%, but is reduced to 34% after applying the shared parenting
time adjustment for 40% custody under subdivision (c).
Father’s basic child support obligation for this child is $320
($941 × 34%). Mother’s basic child support obligation is calculated using the schedule in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3 for two
children at the parties’ combined monthly net income of $4,500.

The basic child support obligation is $1,414. Mother has varying partial or shared custody of the two children (40% and
50%). Under subdivision (d)(2), the custodial time is averaged
or in this case 45%. Mother’s proportionate share of the combined monthly net incomes is 56%, but it is reduced to 41%
after applying the shared parenting time adjustment for 45%
custody under subdivision (c). Mother’s basic child support
obligation for these children is $580 ($1,414 × 41%). Offsetting
the support obligations consistent with subdivision (d)(1),
Mother’s obligation is greater than Father’s obligation, and
Father is the obligee receiving the net of the two obligations by
subtracting $320 from $580, or $260.
Official Note: In cases with more than one child and varied partial or shared custodial
schedules, it is not appropriate to perform a separate calculation for each child and offset support amounts as that method does not consider the incremental increases in support for more
than one child built into the schedule of basic child support.
(3) Combined Child Support and Spousal Support or Alimony Pendente
Lite. When Each Party Owes Child Support to the Other Party.
(i) When one or more children reside with each party, the trier-of-fact
shall offset the obligor’s combined spousal support or alimony pendente lite
and basic child support obligations with the obligee’s basic child support
obligation.
(ii) The trier-of-fact shall award the net difference to the obligee as
spousal support or alimony pendente lite and basic child support.
(e) Support Obligations When Custodial Parent Owes Spousal Support. If a
child is residing with the spouse (custodial parent) obligated to pay spousal support or alimony pendente lite and the other spouse (non-custodial parent) has a
legal obligation to support the child, the guideline spousal support or alimony
pendente lite obligation is determined by offsetting the non-custodial parent’s
basic child support obligation and the custodial parent’s spousal support or alimony pendente lite obligation, and awarding the net difference either to the noncustodial parent as spousal support or alimony pendente lite or to the custodial
parent as child support as the circumstances warrant. The calculation is a fivestep process:
(1) Calculate the custodial parent’s spousal support or alimony pendente
lite obligation to the non-custodial parent based on the parties’ monthly net
incomes using the ‘‘without dependent children’’ formula in either Pa.R.C.P.
No. 1910.16-4(a)(1)(Part B) or (a)(2)(Part IV), as appropriate.
(2) Recalculate the parties’ monthly net incomes by adjusting for the spousal support or alimony pendente lite payment paid or received in subdivision
(e)(1).
231 Rule 1910.16-4 GENERAL
1910-54.32
(407108) No. 566 Jan. 22 Copyright  2022 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
(3) Using the recomputed monthly net incomes from subdivision (e)(2),
calculate the non-custodial parent’s basic child support obligation to the custodial parent.
(4) The final support amount is the difference calculated in subdivision
(e)(1) and (e)(3).
(i) If the amount in subdivision (e)(1) is greater than the amount in
subdivision (e)(3), the final amount is spousal support or alimony pendente
lite payable to the non-custodial parent.
(ii) If the amount in subdivision (e)(1) is less than the amount in subdivision (e)(3), the final amount is basic child support payable to the custodial
parent.
(5) If the proceeding is a modification of an order entered before January
1, 2019 that has federal tax consequences associated with spousal support or
alimony pendente lite payments and the final order is spousal support or alimony pendente lite as in subdivision (e)(4)(i), the offset spousal support or alimony pendente lite amount is federally taxable, and the trier-of-fact may deviate the final order due to the tax effect, as appropriate.
Official Note: See Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.19(h).
Explanatory Comment—2005
Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-4(a) sets forth the income shares formula used to establish the support obligation. Subdivision (b) provides the method for calculating support for seven or more children as the
basic support schedule in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3 sets forth the presumptive amount of support for
up to six children.
Subdivision (c) sets forth the method for calculating the presumptive amount of support in cases
where the children spend 40% or more of their time during the year with the obligor. When there is
equal time sharing, subdivision (2) reduces the support obligation further so that the obligor does not
pay more than is necessary to equalize the parties’ combined monthly net income between the two
households. Subdivision (3) expressly excludes SSR cases from the application of this rule. Since the
SSR already reduces support to a minimal level, a further reduction should not be given for the
amount of time spent with the children.
Subdivision (d) relates to the calculation of support in divided or split custody cases. It retains the
existing method for offsetting the parties’ respective support obligations when one or more of the
children resides with each party.
Subdivision (e) governs spousal support obligations when the custodial parent owes spousal support. It has not been amended, other than to update the example to be consistent with the new schedule at Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-3.
Explanatory Comment—2010
The basic support schedule incorporates an assumption that the children spend 30% of the time
with the obligor and that the obligor makes direct expenditures on their behalf during that time. Variable expenditures, such as food and entertainment, that fluctuate based upon parenting time were
adjusted in the schedule to build in the assumption of 30% parenting time. Upward deviation should
be considered in cases in which the obligor has little or no contact with the children. However, an
upward deviation may not be appropriate if an obligor has infrequent overnight contact with the child,
but provides meals and entertainment during daytime contact. Fluctuating expenditures should be
ACTIONS FOR SUPPORT 231 Rule 1910.16-4

(407109) No. 566 Jan. 22
considered rather than the extent of overnight time. A downward deviation may be appropriate when
the obligor incurs substantial fluctuating expenditures during parenting time but has infrequent overnights with the children.
The calculation in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-4(c) reduces an obligor’s support obligation further if the
obligor spends significantly more time with the children. The obligor will receive an additional 10%
reduction in the amount of support owed at 40% parenting time, increasing incrementally to a 20%
reduction at 50% parenting time. This method still may result in a support obligation even if custody
of the children is equally shared. In those cases, the rule provides for a maximum obligation so that
the obligee does not receive a larger portion of the parties’ combined monthly net income than the
obligor.

Rule 1910.16-5. Support Guidelines. Deviation.
(a) Deviation.
(1) The trier-of-fact may deviate from the basic child support, spousal support, or alimony pendente lite obligation.
(2) If the trier-of-fact determines a deviation is appropriate based on the
factors in subdivision (b), the trier-of-fact shall specify on the record or in
writing:
(i) the calculated basic child support, spousal support, or alimony pendente lite obligation;
(ii) the reason for the deviation;
(iii) the findings of fact justifying the deviation;
(iv) the deviation amount; and
(v) in a spousal support or an alimony pendente lite action, the obligation’s duration.

1910-54.34
(407110) No. 566 Jan. 22 Copyright  2022 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
Official Note: The deviation applies to the support obligation amount or duration, and not
to the party’s monthly net income.
(b) Factors. In deciding whether to deviate from the basic child support,
spousal support, or alimony pendente lite obligation, the trier-of-fact shall consider:
(1) unusual needs and unusual fixed obligations;
(2) a party’s other support obligations;
(3) other household income;
(4) the child’s age;
(5) the parties’ relative assets and liabilities;
(6) medical expenses not covered by insurance;
(7) the parties’ and the child’s standard of living;
(8) in a spousal support or alimony pendente lite case, the duration of the
marriage from the date of marriage to the date of final separation; and
(9) other relevant and appropriate factors, including the child’s best interest.
Explanatory Comment—2005
Rule 1910.16-5 sets forth the factors for deviation from the presumptive amount of support. Subdivision (c) and subsection (b)(8) permit the court to consider the length of the marriage in determining the amount and duration of a spousal support or alimony pendente lite award. The primary purpose of these provisions is to prevent the unfairness that arises in a short-term marriage when the
obligor is required to pay support over a substantially longer period of time than the parties were
married and there is little or no opportunity for credit for these payments at the time of equitable distribution.
Explanatory Comment—2010
The provisions of subdivision (c), which provided that the court must consider the duration of the
parties’ marriage in determining the duration of an award of spousal support or alimony pendente lite,
were moved to new Rule 1910.16-1(c)(2). The duration of the marriage, from the date of marriage to
the date of final separation, remains a factor to consider in determining whether or not deviation from
the amount of the award is warranted.

Rule 1910.16-6. Support Guidelines. Basic Support Obligation Adjustments. Additional Expenses Allocation.
The trier-of-fact may allocate between the parties the additional expenses in
subdivisions (a)—(e). Even when a basic support order is inappropriate under the
facts of the case, the trier-of-fact may allocate between the parties the additional
expenses.
Except for the subdivisions (b)(4) and (e) expenses, the trier-of-fact shall calculate the parties’ proportionate share of the additional expenses after adjusting
the parties’ monthly net income by the spousal support or alimony pendente lite
obligation received or paid, and dividing each party’s adjusted monthly net
income by the parties’ combined monthly net income. However, the trier-of-fact
shall not adjust the parties’ monthly net incomes when apportioning the expenses
in child support only cases.
(a) Child Care Expenses.
(1) The trier-of-fact:
(i) shall allocate reasonable child care expenses paid by the parties, if
necessary to maintain employment or appropriate education in pursuit of
income.
(ii) may allocate reasonable child care expenses that would be paid by
the parties when the trier-of-fact imputes an earning capacity to a party pursuant to Pa.R.Civ.P. 1910.16-2(d)(4)(i)(D).
(2) The trier-of-fact may require that the obligor’s share be added to the
basic child support obligation, paid directly to the service provider, or paid
directly to the obligee.
(3) When a party is receiving a child care subsidy through the Department
of Human Services, the expense allocated between the parties is the amount
actually paid by the party receiving the subsidy.
(4) The party seeking allocation of child care expenses shall provide to the
other party the expense’s documentation, such as a receipt or an invoice,
promptly after receipt unless the service provider invoices the parties separately
for the party’s proportionate share of the expense.
(5) The trier-of-fact shall have the discretion to not allocate expenses if
documentation is not timely provided to the other party.
(6) Except as provided in subdivision (a)(7), the total child care expenses
shall be reduced to reflect the federal child care tax credit available to the eligible party, regardless of whether the credit is actually claimed by that party,
up to the maximum annual cost allowable under the Internal Revenue Code.
(7) If the eligible party is not qualified to receive the credit, the federal
child care tax credit shall not be used to reduce the child care expenses subject
to allocation between the parties.

(b) Health Insurance Premium.
(1) The trier-of-fact shall allocate the health insurance premium paid by the
parties, including the premium attributable to the party paying the premium,
provided that a statutory duty of support is owed to the party or child covered
by the health insurance.
(i) If the party paying the health insurance premium is the obligor, the
obligee’s share is deducted from the obligor’s basic support obligation.
(ii) If the obligee is paying the health insurance premium, the obligor’s
share is added to the obligor’s basic support obligation.
(iii) A health insurance premium allocated between the parties shall also
include health insurance that is provided and paid by a third-party resident
of a party’s household (e.g., step-parent) for a child who is the subject of the
support order.
(2) The trier-of-fact shall not allocate an employer-paid premium or a premium paid for a party, person, or child to whom no statutory duty of support
is owed.
(i) If the parties present evidence of the excluded premium’s actual
amount—the amount attributed to a party, person, or child not owed a statutory duty of support—the trier-of-fact shall deduct the actual amount
excluded from the total premium before allocating the health insurance premium between the parties.
(ii) If the parties do not present evidence of the excluded premium’s
actual amount, the trier-of-fact shall calculate the excluded amount as follows:
(A) determine the premium’s cost per person by dividing the total premium by the number of persons covered under the policy;
(B) multiply the cost per person by the number of persons who are not
owed a statutory duty of support, or are not parties to, or the subject of,
the support action; and
(C) the resulting amount is excluded from allocation.
(3) Pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S. § 4326(a), in every support proceeding, the
trier-of-fact shall ascertain a parent’s ability to provide medical support for the
parties’ child and the support ‘‘order shall include a requirement for medical
support to be provided by either or both parents, provided that such medical
support is accessible to the children.’’
(i) The obligor bears the initial responsibility of providing the child’s
health care coverage if it is available at a reasonable cost.
(A) ‘‘Reasonable cost’’ to an obligor shall be defined as an amount that
does not exceed 5% of the obligor’s monthly net income and, when added
to the basic child support obligation plus additional expenses the obligor is
ordered to pay, does not exceed 50% of the obligor’s monthly net income.
(B) If the obligee is providing the coverage, the ‘‘reasonable cost’’ of
the obligor’s share shall be defined as an amount that does not exceed 5%
ACTIONS FOR SUPPORT 231 Rule 1910.16-6

of the obligor’s monthly net income and, when added to the basic child
support obligation plus additional expenses the obligor is ordered to pay,
does not exceed 50% of the obligor’s monthly net income.
(ii) Unless the child’s health care coverage is provided by the obligee
or a third party, the court shall issue the National Medical Support Notice
required by 23 Pa.C.S. § 4326(d.1) to the obligor’s employer in response to
notification that the obligor is employed.
(A) The notice shall direct the employer to enroll the obligor’s child
who is the subject of the support proceeding if the coverage is available at
a reasonable cost to the obligor.
(B) However, the notice shall direct that enrollment shall not occur
earlier than 25 days from the date of the National Medical Support Notice
to allow the obligor time to object.
(C) Concurrent with the issuance of the National Medical Support
Notice, the court shall provide notice to the obligor setting forth the process to object to the enrollment based upon unreasonable cost, mistake of
fact, or availability of alternative health care coverage for the child.
(D) If there is more than one employer-provided health care coverage
option, the obligor shall select the coverage, subject to the obligee’s right
to seek a court order designating a different option.
(iii) Absent the availability of health care coverage to the obligor for the
parties’ child at a reasonable cost, the court shall order the obligee to provide
health care coverage for the child if it is available at a reasonable cost.
‘‘Reasonable cost’’ to the obligee shall be defined as an amount not to exceed
5% of the obligee’s monthly net income.
(iv) If health care coverage is not available to the parties at a reasonable
cost, the court may order the party having primary custody to apply for
government-sponsored coverage, such as the Children’s Health Insurance
Program (‘‘CHIP’’), with any co-premium or other cost apportioned between
the parties in proportion to the parties’ respective monthly net incomes.
(v) Within 30 days after the entry of the support order, the party ordered
to provide health care coverage shall provide written proof to the other party
that medical insurance has been obtained, including insurance cards and all
other materials set forth in the form order in Pa.R.Civ.P. 1910.27(e). There
shall be a continuing obligation to provide the other party and the domestic
relations section with proof of any changes in coverage.
(vi) The trier-of-fact shall give preference to health care coverage that is
readily accessible to the child, as defined by geographic coverage area,
access to local treatment providers, or other relevant factors.
(4) If the obligor is paying for the health insurance, the obligee has no
income or minimal income, and the obligor will bear 90% or more of the health
insurance premium:

(i) the trier-of-fact may, as fairness requires, deduct part or all of the
premium actually paid by the obligor to provide coverage for the other party
or the child from the obligor’s gross income to determine monthly net
income for support purposes.
(ii) If such a deduction is taken from the obligor’s gross income, the
premium allocation as set forth in subdivision (b)(1) shall not be applied.
(c) Reasonable Unreimbursed Medical Expenses. The trier-of-fact shall allocate the obligee’s or child’s reasonable unreimbursed medical expenses. However,
the trier-of-fact shall not allocate reasonable unreimbursed medical expenses
incurred by a party who is not owed a statutory duty of support by the other party.
The trier-of-fact may require that the obligor’s expense share be included in the
basic support obligation, paid directly to the health care provider, or paid directly
to the obligee.
(1) Medical Expenses.
(i) For purposes of this subdivision, medical expenses are annual unreimbursed medical expenses in excess of $250 per person.
(ii) Medical expenses include insurance co-payments and deductibles
and all expenses reasonably incurred for necessary medical services and supplies, including but not limited to surgical, dental, and optical services, psychiatric and psychological services, and orthodontia.
(iii) Medical expenses do not include cosmetic, chiropractic, or other
services unless specifically directed in the order of court.
(2) The trier-of-fact may impose an annual limitation when the burden on
the obligor would otherwise be excessive.
(3) Annual expenses shall be calculated on a calendar year basis.
(i) In the year in which the initial support order is entered, or in any
period in which support is being paid that is less than a full year, the $250
threshold shall be pro-rated.
(ii) The party seeking allocation for an unreimbursed medical expense
shall provide to the other party the expense’s documentation, such as a
receipt or an invoice, promptly upon receipt, but not later than March 31st of
the year following the calendar year in which the final bill was received by
the party seeking allocation.
(iii) For purposes of subsequent enforcement, unreimbursed medical
bills need not be submitted to the domestic relations section prior to March
31st.
(iv) The trier-of-fact shall have the discretion to not allocate an expense
if documentation is not timely provided to the other party.
(4) If the trier-of-fact determines that out-of-network unreimbursed medical expenses were not obtained due to medical emergency or other compelling
factors, the trier-of-fact may deem those expenses to be unreasonable and
decline to assess the expenses against the other party.
(d) Private School Tuition or Summer Camp. Other Additional Expenses.
Expenses outside the scope of typical child-rearing expenses, such as private
school tuition, summer camp fees, and other additional expenses as set forth in
subdivision (d)(2), have not been factored into the Basic Child Support Schedule.

(1) Private School Tuition or Summer Camp. If the trier-of-fact determines
that private school or summer camp is reasonable under the parties’ circumstances, the trier-of-fact shall apportion the expense to the parties.
(2) Other Additional Expenses. The trier-of-fact shall apportion an additional expense to the parties, if the trier-of-fact determines that the expense:
(i) is related to the child’s educational, extra-curricular, or developmental activities; and
(ii) is reasonable under the parties’ circumstances.
(3) The trier-of-fact may require that a party’s proportionate share of a
subdivision (d)(1) or (d)(2) expense is:
(i) included in or excluded from the basic child support obligation;
(ii) paid directly to the service provider; or
(iii) paid directly to the other party.
(4) Documentation.
(i) The party seeking allocation of an expense shall provide the other
party with the expense’s documentation, such as a receipt or an invoice,
promptly upon receipt, but not later than March 31st of the year following
the calendar year in which the party incurred the expense, unless the service
provider invoices the parties separately.
(ii) For subsequent enforcement purposes, a party does not need to submit the expense’s documentation to the domestic relations section before
March 31.
(iii) The trier-of-fact shall have the discretion to not allocate an expense
if documentation is not timely provided to the other party.
(e) Mortgage Payment. The support guidelines assume that the spouse occupying the marital residence will be solely responsible for the mortgage payment,
real estate taxes, and homeowners’ insurance. Similarly, the trier-of-fact shall
assume that the party occupying the marital residence will be paying the items
listed unless the recommendation specifically provides otherwise.
(1) If the obligee is living in the marital residence and the mortgage payment exceeds 25% of the obligee’s monthly net income (including amounts of
spousal support, alimony pendente lite, and child support), the trier-of-fact may
require the obligor to assume up to 50% of the excess amount in the obligor’s
support obligation.
(2) If the obligor is occupying the marital residence and the mortgage payment exceeds 25% of the obligor’s monthly net income (less any amount of
spousal support, alimony pendente lite, and child support the obligor is paying),
the trier-of-fact may downwardly adjust the obligor’s support obligation.
(3) This rule shall not be applicable after a final resolution of the outstanding economic claims in the parties’ divorce action.
(4) For purposes of this subdivision, ‘‘mortgage’’ shall include a first mortgage, real estate taxes, and homeowners’ insurance and may include a subsequent mortgage, a home equity loan, and other marital obligations secured by
the marital residence.

Comment:
Subdivision (a)(1)(i) Example: Mother has primary custody of the parties’ two children and Father
has partial custody. The parties’ respective monthly net incomes are $2,000 and $3,500. At the combined monthly net income of $5,500 for two children, the basic child support obligation is $1,567. As
Father’s income represents 64% of the parties’ combined monthly net income, Father’s basic child
support obligation is $1,003. Mother incurs monthly child care expenses of $400, and Father incurs
$100 per month. The total child care expenses, $500, will be apportioned between the parties, with
Father paying 64%, or $320. As Father is paying $100 for the children’s child care during his partial
custody, he would pay the remaining $220 to Mother for a total child support obligation of $1,223
($1,003 + $220).
Subdivision (b) does not apply to Medical Assistance. See 23 Pa.C.S. § 4326(l).
Subdivision (b)(1)-(b)(2) Example 1: If the parties are separated, but not divorced, and Husband
pays $200 monthly for employer-provided health insurance for himself, Wife, the parties’ child, and
two additional children from a previous marriage, the premium attributable to the additional two children, if not otherwise verifiable or known with reasonable ease and certainty, is calculated by dividing $200 by five persons and then multiplying the resulting amount of $40 per person by the two
additional children, for a total of $80 to be excluded from allocation. Deduct this amount from the
total premium to arrive at the premium to be allocated between the parties—$120. Since Husband is
paying the premium, and spouses have a statutory duty to support one another pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S.
§ 4321, Wife’s percentage share of the $120 is deducted from Husband’s support obligation. If Wife
had been providing the coverage, Husband’s percentage share would be added to his basic support
obligation.
Subdivision (b)(1)-(b)(2) Example 2: If the parties are divorced and Father pays $200 monthly for
employer-provided health insurance for himself, the parties’ child, and two additional children from
a previous marriage, the premium attributable to Father and the two additional children will not be
allocated between the parties. Thus, using the same calculations in Example 1, the premium attributable to Father and the two other children is $150 ($200 premium divided among four covered persons
equals $50 per person multiplied by three) and that amount is deducted from the total premium, leaving $50 ($200  $150 = $50) to be allocated between the parties.
Subdivision (b)(1)-(b)(2) Example 3: The parties are divorced, and Mother is the obligee of a child
support order. Father, the obligor, pays $200 monthly for employer-provided health insurance for
himself and the parties’ child. Mother pays $400 per month for her employer-provided health insurance that covers only herself. The premium Father pays to cover the parties’ child, $100 ($200 premium divided between two covered persons, Father and the child), will be allocated between the parties in proportion to their respective monthly net incomes. The premium that covers Father will not
be allocated because the parties are no longer married, and he is not owed a duty of support by
Mother. The premium Mother pays to provide her own coverage will not be allocated because the
parties are no longer married and she is not owed a duty of support by Father.
Concerning subdivision (b)(3), the maximum amount of any attachment for child and medical support is set forth by the federal Consumer Credit Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1601 et seq.
Subdivision (c) is intended to implement 23 Pa.C.S. § 4326(e).
An unreimbursed medical expense may be unreasonable if it was an avoidable expense incurred
solely by the party requesting reimbursement, e.g., expenses for missed office visits, excessive supplies, purchases of name brand medications when generic medications are suitable and available,
denial of insurance coverage because of a failure to comply with plan requirements, or non-emergency
out-of-network expenses pursuant to subdivision (c)(4).
The determination of medical necessity of a medical service or medical supplies can be made in a
support proceeding or a custody proceeding. Even if challenged during a support proceeding (rather

than a custody proceeding), the necessity of a medical service or medical supplies, which results in
an unreimbursed medical expense for which a party seeks allocation subject to subdivision (c)(1)(ii),
should be determined by the trier-of-fact, and subject to review by a judge if the trier-of-fact is not a
judge.
If the trier-of-fact determines that a party acted reasonably in obtaining services that were not specifically set forth in the order of support, payment for such services may be ordered retroactively.
Pursuant to subdivision (c)(1)(iii), medical expenses for cosmetic, chiropractic, or other services
may be, but are not required to be, allocated between the parties by the trier-of-fact if such expenses
are reasonable and necessary.
Historical Commentary
The following commentary is historical in nature and represents statements of the Committee at the
time of rulemaking:
Explanatory Comment—2004
Subdivision (a), relating to the federal child care tax credit, has been amended to reflect recent
amendments to the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 21. By generally referencing the Tax Code,
rather than incorporating current Code provisions in the rule, further amendments will be incorporated
into the support calculation.
Explanatory Comment—2005
Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-6 governs the treatment of additional expenses that warrant an adjustment
to the basic support obligation.
Subdivision (a) relates to child care expenses. Subdivision (a) has been amended to require that
child care expenses incurred by either party are to be allocated between the parties in proportion to
their respective net incomes. Subsection (a)(1), relating to the federal child care tax credit, was
amended in 2004 to reflect recent amendments to the Internal Revenue Code. 26 U.S.C. § 21. By
referring to the Tax Code in general, rather than incorporating current Code provisions in the rule, any
further amendments will be incorporated into the support calculation. Since the tax credit may be
taken only against taxes owed, it cannot be used when the eligible parent does not incur sufficient tax
liability to fully realize the credit. For this reason, subsection (2) provides that no adjustment to the
total child care expenses may be made if the eligible parent does not qualify to receive the credit.
Subdivision (b) addresses health insurance premiums. The cost of the premiums is generally treated
as an additional expense to be allocated between the parties in proportion to their net incomes. Subdivision (b)(1) of the rule permits allocation of the entire premium, including the portion of the premium covering the party carrying the insurance, when the insurance benefits the other party and/or
the children. Subdivision (b)(2) clarifies that, in calculating the amount of the health care premium to
be allocated between the parties, subdivision (b)(1) requires the inclusion of that portion of the health
insurance premium covering the party who is paying the premium, so long as there is a statutory duty
of support owed to that party, but not the portion of the premium attributable to non-parties and children who are not the subjects of the support order. Subdivision (b)(2) provides for proration of the
premium when the health insurance covers other persons who are not subject to the support action or
owed a statutory duty of support. Subdivision (b) also permits an alternative method for dealing with
the cost of health insurance premiums in certain circumstances. While, in general, the cost of the premiums will be treated as an additional expense to be allocated between the parties in proportion to
their net incomes, in cases in which the obligee has no income or minimal income, subsection (4)
authorizes the trier-of-fact to reduce the obligor’s gross income for support purposes by some or all
of the amount of the health insurance premiums. This is to avoid the result under a prior rule in which
the entire cost of health insurance would have been borne by the obligor, with no resulting reduction
in the amount of support he or she would otherwise be required to pay under the support guidelines.
The goal of this provision is to encourage and facilitate the maintenance of health insurance coverage
for dependents by giving the obligor a financial incentive to maintain health insurance coverage.
231 Rule 1910.16-6 GENERAL
1910-54.42
(423026) No. 608 Jul. 25 Copyright  2025 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
Subdivision (c) deals with unreimbursed medical expenses. Since the first $250 of medical
expenses per year per child is built into the basic guideline amount in the child support schedule, only
medical expenses in excess of $250 per year per child are subject to allocation under this rule as an
additional expense to be added to the basic support obligation. The same is true with respect to spousal support so that the obligee-spouse is expected to assume the first $250 per year of these expenses
and may seek contribution under this rule only for unreimbursed expenses which exceed $250 per
year. The definition of ‘‘medical expenses’’ includes insurance co-payments, deductibles and orthodontia and excludes chiropractic services.
Subdivision (d) governs apportionment of private school tuition, summer camp and other unusual
needs not reflected in the basic guideline amounts of support. The rule presumes allocation in proportion to the parties’ net incomes consistent with the treatment of the other additional expenses.
Subdivision (e) provides for the apportionment of mortgage expenses. It defines ‘‘mortgage’’ to
include the real estate taxes and homeowners’ insurance. While real estate taxes and homeowners’
insurance must be included if the trier-of-fact applies the provisions of this subdivision, the inclusion
of second mortgages, home equity loans and other obligations secured by the marital residence is
within the trier-of-fact’s discretion based upon the circumstances of the case.
Explanatory Comment—2006
A new introductory sentence in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-6 clarifies that additional expenses contemplated in the rule may be allocated between the parties even if the parties’ respective incomes do not
warrant an award of basic support. Thus, even if application of either formula Pa.R.C.P. No.
1910.16-4 results in a basic support obligation of zero, the trier-of-fact may enter a support order
allocating between the parties any or all of the additional expenses addressed in this rule.
The amendment of subdivision (e) recognizes that the obligor may be occupying the marital residence and that, in particular circumstances, justice and fairness may warrant an adjustment in his or
her support obligation.
Explanatory Comment—2008
Federal and state statutes require clarification to subdivision (b) to ensure that all court orders for
support address the children’s ongoing need for medical care. In those instances where the children’s
health care needs are paid by the state’s medical assistance program, and eligibility for the Children’s
Health Insurance Program (‘‘CHIP’’) is denied due to the minimal income of the custodial parent, the
obligor remains required to enroll the parties’ children in health insurance that is, or may become,
available that is reasonable in cost.
Government-sponsored health care plans represent a viable alternative to the often prohibitive cost
of health insurance obtainable by a parent. Except for very low income children, every child is eligible for CHIP, for which the parent with primary physical custody must apply and which is based on
that parent’s income. A custodial parent may apply for CHIP by telephone or on the Internet. While
co-premiums or co-pays increase as the custodial parent’s income increases, such costs are generally
modest and should be apportioned between the parties. Moreover, health care coverage obtained by
the custodial parent generally yields more practical results, as the custodial parent resides in the geographic coverage area, enrollment cards are issued directly to the custodial parent, and claims may be
submitted directly by the custodial parent.
Explanatory Comment—2010
Subdivision (e), relating to mortgages on the marital residence, has been amended to clarify that
the rule cannot be applied after a final order of equitable distribution has been entered. To the extent
that Isralsky v. Isralsky, 824 A.2d 1178 (Pa. Super. 2003), holds otherwise, it is superseded. At the
time of resolution of the parties’ economic claims, the former marital residence will either have been
awarded to one of the parties or otherwise addressed.

1910-54.43
(423027) No. 608 Jul. 25
Explanatory Comment—2018
The amendments provide for an adjustment to the parties’ monthly net incomes prior to determining the percentage each party pays toward the expenses set forth in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-6. Previously, the Rules of Civil Procedure apportioned the enumerated expenses in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-
6(a)—(d), with the exception of subdivision (c)(5), between the parties based on the parties’
respective monthly net incomes as calculated pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-2. This apportionment did not consider the amount of support paid by the obligor or received by the obligee.
The amended rule adjusts the parties’ monthly net incomes, upward or downward, by the spousal
support/APL amount paid or received by that party prior to apportioning the expenses. This methodology is not new to the Rules of Civil Procedure. In Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-6(c)(5) (rescinded), the
parties’ monthly net incomes in spousal support/APL-only cases were similarly adjusted prior to the
apportionment of unreimbursed medical expenses. Likewise, Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-6(e) considers the
parties’ monthly net income after the receipt or payment of the support obligation for purposes of
determining a mortgage deviation. As the new procedure adopts the methodology in former subdivision (c)(5), that subdivision has been rescinded as delineating the spousal support only circumstance
is unnecessary.
Lastly, the amendment consolidates Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-6(b)(1), (2), and (2.1).

Rule 1910.16-7. Support Guidelines. Multiple Family Child Support
Obligations.
(a) When an obligor’s basic child support obligations total 50% or less of the
obligor’s monthly net income, there will be no deviation from the basic support
obligation on the ground of the existence of a new family.
Example: If the obligor requests a reduction of support for one
child of the first marriage on the basis that there is a new child
of the second intact marriage, and the relevant monthly net
incomes are $2,500 for the obligor, $500 for the former spouse,
and $1,300 for the current spouse, the request for a reduction
231 Rule 1910.16-7 GENERAL
1910-54.44
(423028) No. 608 Jul. 25 Copyright  2025 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
will be denied because the obligor’s basic support obligations
total $1,138 ($576 for the first child and $562 for the second
child) and are less than half of the obligor’s monthly net
income.
(b) When the total of the obligor’s basic support obligations exceeds 50% of
the obligor’s monthly net income, the trier-of-fact may proportionately reduce the
basic support obligations.
(1) The goal of the guidelines is to treat each child equitably, and a first or
later family shall not receive preference.
(2) The trier-of-fact shall not divide the basic child support obligations for
all of the obligor’s children among the households in which those children live.
Example 1. The obligor is sued for support of an out-ofwedlock child. The obligor is already paying support for two
children of the first marriage, and has an intact second marriage
with one child. The relevant monthly net incomes are $3,800
for the obligor, $1,100 for the former spouse, $0 for the current
spouse, and $1,500 for the parent of the new child. The obligor’s basic child support obligations to each family are $1,140
for the two children of the first marriage, $854 for the one child
of the second marriage, and $743 for the one child out of wedlock for a total of $2,737. Since the total of these obligations
exceeds 50% of the obligor’s monthly net income of $3,800,
the trier-of-fact may consider a proportional reduction of the
orders.
Example 2. The obligor is sued for support of three children of
a second marriage. There is already an order in effect for two
children of the first marriage. The relevant monthly net incomes
are $2,500 for the obligor, $0 for the first spouse, and $500 for
the second spouse. The obligor’s basic child support obligation
to each family is $877 for the two children of the first marriage
and $1,040 for the three children of the second marriage for a
total support obligation of $1,917. Since the total obligation
leaves the obligor with only $583 on which to live, the orders
are too high as the obligor must be left with a Self-Support
Reserve of $1,063. However, reducing the order for three children while leaving the existing order intact would give preference to the first family, contrary to the rule. Therefore, both
orders shall be reduced proportionally.
Example 3. The obligor is sued by three obligees to establish
orders for three children. The monthly net income for the obligor and for each obligee is $1,500. The trier-of-fact would
determine that the obligor’s basic child support obligation for
each child is $346 for a total of $1,038 for three children. It
would be incorrect to determine the basic child support obligation for three children, in this case $1,253, and divide that
amount among the three children. As the obligations exceed
50% of the obligor’s monthly net income, the support orders
should be reduced proportionately consistent with subdivision
(b) and ensure the obligor retains the Self-Support Reserve of
$1,063 consistent with Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-2(e).

(c) Presumptive Basic Support Obligation.
(1) For purposes of this rule, the obligor’s presumptive basic support obligation:
(i) is calculated using only the formula in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-4; and
(ii) does not include any additional expenses that may be added pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-6.
(2) In calculating the obligor’s presumptive basic support obligation, the
trier-of-fact shall ensure that the obligor retains at least $1,063 per month consistent with Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-2(e).
Example 1. Assume that the obligor is paying $553 per month
support for one child of the first marriage, plus an additional
$200 per month for child care expenses. The obligor requests a
reduction in this support obligation on the basis that there is one
new child of the second intact marriage. The relevant incomes
are $2,400 for the obligor and $0 for the former and current
spouses. The obligor’s request for a reduction shall be denied
because the total of the basic support obligations for both children is only $1,106 ($553 for each child) and does not exceed
50% of the obligor’s monthly net income. A reduction shall not
be given on the basis that the obligor’s contribution to child
care expenses for the first child results in an total basic support
child obligation of $1,306, which exceeds 50% of the obligor’s
monthly net income. The presumptive basic child support obligations for the two children still total $1,106 ($553 for each
child). The trier-of-fact shall consider the deviation factors
under Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-5 and the parties’ respective contributions to additional expenses under Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-6
in arriving at an appropriate total child support obligation for
each child.
Example 2. Assume that the obligor is paying $346 per month
support for one child of the first marriage. The obligor has one
new child of the second intact marriage. The relevant incomes
are $1,500 for the obligor and $0 for the former and current
spouses. A reduction shall not be given on the basis of the obligor’s new child because the presumptive basic child support
obligations total $692 ($346 for each child) and this amount
does not exceed 50% of the obligor’s monthly net income.
Since, however, this amount leaves the obligor with only $808
per month, the trier-of-fact shall proportionally reduce the basic
child support obligations so that the obligor retains $1,063 per
month. The presumptive basic child support obligations total
$437 ($218.50 for each child). The trier-of-fact shall consider
the deviation factors under Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-5 and the
parties’ respective contributions to additional expenses under
Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-6 in arriving at an appropriate total child
support obligation for each child.
Explanatory Comment—2010
Rule 1910.16-7 has been amended to reflect the updated schedule in Rule 1910.16-3 and the
increase in the Self-Support Reserve to $867 per month, the 2008 federal poverty level for one person. The distribution priorities formerly in subdivision (d) have been moved to Rule 1910.17(d) to
clarify that these priorities apply to all support orders, not just those involving multiple families.

Rule 1910.17. Support Order. Effective Date. Change of Circumstances.
Copies of Order. Priority of Distribution of Payments.
(a) An order of support shall be effective from the date of the filing of the
complaint or petition for modification unless the order specifies otherwise. In a
child support case, if a change in custody occurs after the date of filing, but
before a domestic relations conference is held, the trier of fact shall enter a
charging order going forward in favor of the primary custodian that shall be
effective from the date of the change in custody. The trier of fact also may enter
a retroactive arrears order in favor of the party who was the primary custodian at
the time of filing. Such an order may address the period from the date of fining
to the date of the change in custody. However, a modification of an existing support order may be retroactive to a date preceding the date of filing if the petitioner
was precluded from filing a petition for modification by reason of a significant
physical or mental disability, misrepresentation of another party or other compelling reason and if the petitioner, when no longer precluded, promptly filed a petition.
Example: Mother has primary custody of the children and files for
child support. Two months later, Father becomes the primary custodian. One month after the change in custody, a support conference is
held. Father will be the obligee on a charging order that is retroactive
to the date he became the primary custodian. However, an order also
may be entered with Mother as the obligee for the two-month period
from the date of filing to the date of the change in custody.
Official Note: The order must direct payment to be made payable to or payment to be made
to the State Collection and Disbursement Unit for transmission to the obligee. See 23 Pa.C.S.
§ 4325.
Subdivision (a) was amended in 2005 to include the statutory provision at 23 Pa.C.S.
§ 4352(e) that authorizes the court to enter a modified order that is effective to a date prior to
the date on which the petition for modification was filed in certain circumstances. To the effect
that the holding in Kelleher v. Bush, 832 A.2d 483 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2003), is inconsistent, it is
superseded. See 23 Pa.C.S. § 4352(e) for additional provisions.
Every order of support must contain an immediate or conditional order for the
attachment of income. See Rule 1910.21.
(b) The order shall notify the obligee and the obligor that each is under a
continuing obligation to inform the domestic relations section in writing or by
ACTIONS FOR SUPPORT 231 Rule 1910.17

personal appearance and all other parties in writing within seven days of any
material change in circumstances relevant to the level of support or the administration of the support order, including, but not limited to, loss or change of
income or employment and change of personal address or change of address of
any child receiving support. The order shall also notify the parties that if a party
willfully fails to inform the domestic relations section of the required information, the court may adjudge the party to be in contempt of court pursuant to Rules
1910.25 through 1910.25-6 and may order the party to be punished by one or
more of the following: jail, fine or probation.
(c) A copy of the support order shall be provided to each party to the action
and to the party’s attorney, if any, pursuant to Rule 440.
(d) The priorities for distribution of payments and/or collections from the
obligor, without regard to the source of the funds or method of collection, are as
follows:
(1) monthly current child support.
(2) medical, child care or other court-ordered child support-related
expenses.
(3) monthly ordered amount toward child support arrears.
(4) monthly current spousal support or alimony pendente lite.
(5) remaining child support arrears.
(6) monthly ordered amount toward spousal support or alimony pendente
lite arrears.
(7) remaining spousal support or alimony pendente lite arrears.
(8) court costs and fees.
Explanatory Comment—2010
Subdivision (d) has been moved from Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-7 and expanded for clarification. It
addresses the priority of the distribution of payments and collections in all cases, not just those
involving multiple families. However, collections realized through the interception of federal tax
returns by the Internal Revenue Service are subject to federal distribution priorities. See 45 CFR
§ 303.72(h). An unallocated order for child support and spousal support or child support and alimony
pendente lite has the same priority as a child support order.

Rule 1910.19. Support. Modification. Termination. Guidelines as Substantial Change in Circumstances. Overpayments.
(a) A petition for modification or termination of an existing support order
shall specifically aver the material and substantial change in circumstances upon
which the petition is based. A new guideline amount resulting from new or
revised support guidelines may constitute a material and substantial change in
circumstances. The existence of additional income, income sources or assets
identified through automated methods or otherwise may also constitute a material
and substantial change in circumstances.
(b) The procedure upon the petition shall be in accordance with Rule 1910.10
et seq. After a party has filed a petition for modification of a child support order,
the petition may not be withdrawn unless both parties consent or with leave of
court. A petition for modification of spousal support or alimony pendente lite may
be withdrawn without the consent of the other party or leave of court.
(c) Pursuant to a petition for modification, the trier-of-fact may modify or
terminate the existing support order in any appropriate manner based on the evidence presented without regard to which party filed the petition for modification.
If the trier-of-fact finds that there has been a material and substantial change in
circumstances, the order may be increased or decreased based on the parties’
respective monthly net incomes, consistent with the support guidelines, existing
law, and Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.18(d), and the party’s custodial time with the child
at the time the modification petition is heard.
(d) All charging orders for spousal support and alimony pendente lite shall
terminate upon the death of the payee spouse.
(e) Within six months prior to the date a child who is the subject of a child
support order reaches eighteen (18) years of age, the domestic relations section
ACTIONS FOR SUPPORT 231 Rule 1910.19
1910-54.49
(407125) No. 566 Jan. 22
shall issue an emancipation inquiry and notice to the obligee, with a copy to the
obligor, seeking the following information:
(1) confirmation of the child’s date of birth, date of graduation or withdrawal from high school;
(2) whether the child has left the obligee’s household and, if so, the date
of departure;
(3) the existence of any agreement between the parties requiring payments
for the benefit of the child after the child has reached age eighteen (18) or
graduated from high school; and
(4) any special needs of the child which may be a basis for continuing
support for that child beyond the child’s eighteenth birthday or graduation from
high school, whichever is last to occur.
The notice shall advise the obligee that if the inquiry is not returned within
thirty (30) days of mailing or if there is no agreement or the child does not have
any special needs, the charging order may be modified or terminated by the court.
In order to avoid overpayment, when no other children are subjects of the child
support order and the obligee either does not return the emancipation inquiry
within thirty (30) days of its mailing or does not assert grounds for continuing
support for the child, then the domestic relations section shall administratively
terminate the child support charging order without further proceedings on the last
to occur of the date the last child reaches age eighteen (18) or graduates from
high school. Termination of the charging order shall not affect any arrears accrued
through the date of termination. The court shall have the authority to enter an
order requiring the obligor to pay on arrears in an amount equal to the amount of
the charging order until all arrears are paid.
If the order applies to another child or children and/or the obligee asserts that
there is an agreement between the parties or that a child has special needs requiring continued support, then the domestic relations section may schedule a conference prior to the child’s attaining age 18 or graduating from high school to determine if the charging order should be modified.
(f) Upon notice to the obligee, with a copy to the obligor, explaining the
basis for the proposed modification or termination, the court may modify or terminate a charging order for support and remit any arrears, all without prejudice,
when it appears to the court that:
(1) the order is no longer able to be enforced under state law; or
(2) the obligor is unable to pay, has no known income or assets and there
is no reasonable prospect that the obligor will be able to pay in the foreseeable
future.
The notice shall advise the obligee to contact the domestic relations section
within 60 days of the date of the mailing of the notice if the obligee wishes to
contest the proposed modification or termination. If the obligee objects, the
domestic relations section shall schedule a conference to provide the obligee the
opportunity to contest the proposed action. If the obligee does not respond to the
231 Rule 1910.19 GENERAL
1910-54.50
(407126) No. 566 Jan. 22 Copyright  2022 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
notice or object to the proposed action, the court shall have the authority to
modify or terminate the order and remit any arrears, without prejudice.
(g) Overpayments.
(1) Order in Effect. If there is an overpayment in an amount in excess of
two months of the monthly support obligation and a charging order remains in
effect, after notice to the parties as set forth below, the domestic relations section shall reduce the charging order by 20% or an amount sufficient to retire
the overpayment by the time the charging order is terminated. The notice shall
advise the parties to contact the domestic relations section within 30 days of
the date of the mailing of the notice if either or both of them wishes to contest
the proposed reduction of the charging order. If either party objects, the domestic relations section shall schedule a conference to provide the objecting party
the opportunity to contest the proposed action. If neither party responds to the
notice or objects to the proposed action, the domestic relations section shall
have the authority to reduce the charging order.
(2) Order Terminated. If there is an overpayment in any amount and there
is no charging order in effect, within one year of the termination of the charging order, the former obligor may file a petition with the domestic relations
section seeking recovery of the overpayment. A copy shall be served upon the
former obligee as original process. The domestic relations section shall schedule a conference on the petition, which shall be conducted consistent with the
rules governing support actions. The domestic relations section shall have the
authority to enter an order against the former obligee for the amount of the
overpayment in a monthly amount to be determined by the trier of fact after
consideration of the former obligee’s ability to pay.
(h) Modification of a Support Order with Child Support and Spousal Support
or Child Support and Alimony Pendente Lite Entered Before January 1, 2019.
(1) In a subsequent modification proceeding of an order awarding child
support and spousal support or child support and alimony pendente lite, as provided in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.18(d), the trier-of-fact may on its own motion or
upon the motion of a party:
(i) make an unallocated award in favor of the spouse and one or more
children; or
(ii) state the support amount allocable to the spouse and to each child.
(2) The trier-of-fact shall clearly state whether the order is allocated or
unallocated even if the child support and spousal support or child support and
alimony pendente lite amounts are delineated in the order.
(i) If the order is allocated, the Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910-16.4(a)(2)(Part IV)
formula determines the spousal support amount.
(A) As the formula assumes an unallocated order, if the order’s allocation utilizing the formula is inequitable, the trier-of-fact may adjust the
order, as appropriate.
(B) In making an adjustment, the trier-of-fact shall consider the federal
income tax consequences.
ACTIONS FOR SUPPORT 231 Rule 1910.19
1910-54.51
(407127) No. 566 Jan. 22
(C) If the parties are in higher income brackets, the income tax considerations are likely to be a more significant factor in determining a support amount.
(ii) If the order is unallocated or the order is for spousal support or alimony pendente lite only, the trier-of-fact shall not consider the federal
income tax consequences.
Official Note: See 23 Pa.C.S. § 4348(d) for additional matters that must be specified in a
support order if arrearages exist when the order is entered.
(3) A support award for a spouse and children is taxable to the obligee
while an award for the children only is not. Consequently, in certain situations,
an award only for the children will be more favorable to the obligee than an
award to the spouse and children. In this situation, the trier-of-fact should utilize the method that provides the greatest benefit to the obligee.
(4) If the obligee’s monthly net income is equal to or greater than the obligor’s monthly net income, the guideline amount for spouse and children is
identical to the guideline amount for children only. Therefore, in cases involving support for spouse and children, whenever the obligee’s monthly net
income is equal to or greater than the obligor’s monthly net income, the guideline amount indicated shall be attributed to child support only.
(5) Unallocated child support and spousal support or child support and alimony pendente lite orders shall terminate upon the obligee’s death.
(6) In the event that the obligor defaults on an unallocated order, the trierof-fact shall allocate the order for child support collection pursuant to the
Internal Revenue Service income tax refund intercept program or for registration and enforcement of the order in another jurisdiction under the Uniform
Interstate Family Support Act, 23 Pa.C.S. §§ 7101—7903. The trier-of-fact
shall provide the parties with notice of allocation.
Official Note: This provision is necessary to comply with various state and federal laws
relating to child support enforcement. It is not intended to affect an unallocated order’s tax consequences.
(7) An unallocated child support and spousal support or child support and
alimony pendente lite order is a final order as to the claims covered in the
order.
(8) Motions for post-trial relief cannot be filed to the final order.
Official Note: The procedure relating to Motions for Reconsideration is set forth in
Pa.R.C.P. No. 1930.2.
Subdivision (h) incorporates Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16 (rescinded) and Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.16-
4(f)(rescinded) for subsequent modification proceedings due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act of 2017 (Pub.L. No. 115-97).
Explanatory Comment—1993
Existence of Guidelines as Substantial Change in Circumstances. In its opinion in Newman v.
Newman, 409 Pa. Super. Ct. 108, 597 A.2d 684 (Pa. Super. 1991), the Superior Court held that enactment of the guidelines does not constitute a substantial change in circumstance which could serve as
the basis for modification of a support order. The amended rule allows the trier of fact to consider
new or revised rules as a change in circumstances where the change in the guidelines, either by itself
or in combination with other factors, is material and substantial.
ACTIONS FOR SUPPORT 231 Rule 1910.19
1910-54.52
(407128) No. 566 Jan. 22
Explanatory Comment—2000
The Pennsylvania Child Support Enforcement System (‘‘PACSES’’) is electronically linked to a
variety of governmental and private agencies and institutions. This linkage enables PACSES to
immediately locate and identify an obligor’s income, income sources and assets. Rule 1910.19 is
amended to provide that their identification through these automated methods provides a basis for
modifying both the current support obligation and the rate of repayment on either past due or overdue
support. Identification through means other than PACSES continues to provide the same basis for
modification.
While identification of income sources or assets provides a basis for modification, this rule is not
intended to prevent a court from ordering that the income or assets be frozen and seized under Rule
1910.26 pending the hearing on the petition for modification. Such relief remains available under Rule
1910.26 governing appropriate interim or special relief. See Rule 1910.1 Explanatory Comment. Nor
is this rule intended to affect the court’s ability to seize income or assets under Rule 1910.20 to secure
an overdue support obligation.
Explanatory Comment—2002
Although support orders do not terminate automatically, many obligors are unaware of the necessity of filing a petition to terminate a child support order when the child becomes emancipated. As a
result, old orders have continued to charge long after the subject child has become an adult. New subdivision (e) is intended to address this problem by giving the obligee notice of a proposed modification or termination of the order and the opportunity to object. If no objection is made, or if the obligee fails to respond with a reason to continue the order, the rule gives the court the authority to
terminate or modify the charging order, depending upon whether or not other children are covered
under the order.
Explanatory Comment—2006
New subdivision (f) addresses an increasing multiplicity of circumstances in which the continued
existence of a court-ordered obligation of support is inconsistent with rules or law. An obligor with
no known assets whose sole source of income is Supplemental Security Income or cash assistance
cannot be ordered to pay support under Rule 1910.16-2. Likewise, an obligor with no verifiable
income or assets whose institutionalization, incarceration or long-term disability precludes the payment of support renders the support order unenforceable and uncollectible, diminishing the perception
of the court as a source of redress and relief. Often, the obligor is unable or unaware of the need to
file for a modification or termination, or the parties abandon the action. In those circumstances, the
courts are charged with managing dockets with no viable outcomes. Both the rules and the federal
guidelines for child support under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act provide for circumstances
under which a support order shall not be entered or under which a child support case may be closed.
Subdivision (f) expands the authority of the courts to respond to case management issues brought
about by changes in circumstances of the parties of which the courts become aware through the
expansion of automated interfaces and data exchanges.

Rule 1910.20. Support Order. Enforcement. General.
(a) A support order shall be enforced by income withholding as required by
law in the manner provided by Rule 1910.21.
(b) Upon the obligor’s failure to comply with a support order, the order may

(1) pursuant to Rule 1910.21, and without further hearing or prior notice
to the obligor, increasing the amount of monthly support payments for payment
of the overdue support at a rate to be determined by the court; withholding or
seizing periodic or lump sum payments of income from a government agency,
including unemployment compensation, social security, retirement or disability
benefits and any other benefits; withholding or seizing periodic or lump sum
payments of income from insurance carriers or privately-insured employers,
ACTIONS FOR SUPPORT 231 Rule 1910.20

including workers’ compensation benefits; withholding or seizing judgments or
settlements; and withholding or seizing public and private retirement funds in
pay status;
(2) pursuant to Rule 1910.22, imposing liens on real property;
(3) pursuant to Rule 1910.23, attaching and seizing assets of the obligor
held in financial institutions;
(4) pursuant to Rule 1910.24, reducing and executing a judgment against
the obligor;
(5) pursuant to Rules 1910.25 through 1910.25-6, initiating contempt proceedings;
(6) reporting the amount of overdue support to consumer reporting agencies in the manner prescribed by 23 Pa.C.S. § 4303;
(7) when the obligor owes overdue support in an amount of three months
or more, suspending occupational, commercial/driver’s and recreational
licenses in the manner prescribed by 23 Pa.C.S. § 4355.
These remedies are cumulative and not alternative.
(c) For purposes of this Rule, overdue support remains subject to the remedies set forth in subdivision (b) of this Rule until paid in full. Except as provided
in 23 Pa.C.S. § 4355 for suspension of licenses, neither a repayment schedule
subsequently agreed to by the parties nor an order of court establishing such a
schedule precludes the use of these remedies for collecting overdue support more
quickly, whenever feasible.

Rule 1910.21. Support Order. Enforcement. Withholding of Income.
(a) Immediate Income Withholding. Every order of court shall contain an
immediate order for the withholding of income unless (1) there is no overdue
support owing under the order and (2) either the court finds there is good cause
not to require immediate income withholding or the parties agree in writing to an
alternative arrangement.
(b) Initiated Income Withholding. If there is no immediate income withholding pursuant to subdivision (a), and nonpayment of the support order causes
overdue support to accrue, the court shall enter an order for the immediate withholding of income.
(c) Order for Withholding. An order for income withholding must include a
provision directing that no commutation or compromise and release of worker’s
compensation benefits, severance pay or any payment in lieu thereof shall be paid
to the defendant until the order for withholding is dissolved by further order of
court.

1910-55
(337891) No. 408 Nov. 08 Copyright  2008 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
(d) Service on Employer.
(1) The order for income withholding shall be served upon the obligor’s
employer. The employer shall pay to the State Collection and Disbursement
Unit the full amount set forth in the order and may deduct from the balance due
the obligor an amount authorized by law for clerical work and expense
involved in complying with the order. Upon termination of the obligor’s
employment, the employer shall notify the domestic relations section of the
termination, the obligor’s last known address, and the name and address of the
obligor’s new employer, if known.
(2) Upon willful failure to obey an order for income withholding, the
employer, or an officer or employee of the employer, may be held in contempt
and subject to other remedies provided by law.
Offical Note: 23 Pa.C.S. § 4348(k)(1) provides that contempt is punishable by jail or fine.
23 Pa.C.S. § 4348(k)(2) provides that the employer is liable for any amount which the employer
willfully fails to withhold or for any amount withheld but not forwarded to the domestic relations section. 23 Pa.C.S. § 4348(k)(3) provides that the court may attach funds or property of
an employer.
(e) Notice to Obligor. Objections. A notice of entry of an order for income
withholding shall be served on the obligor. The obligor may object to the order
in writing or by personal appearance before the county domestic relations section
within ten days after issuance of the notice. The grounds for an objection are
limited to the following mistakes of fact: (i) no overdue support exists under the
order or there is a mistake in the amount of overdue support; (ii) there is a mistake in the identity of the obligor; or (iii) the amount being withheld exceeds the
maximum amount which may be withheld under the federal Consumer Credit
Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1673. If a mistake of fact has occurred, the order
shall be modified accordingly.
(f) Income Withholding When the Obligor Defaults on Support Order.
(1) When an obligor is subject to an order for income withholding and
payment is received from the employer within 15 days from the date upon
which the obligor’s obligation would be considered overdue (i.e. the date upon
which delinquent support is equal to one month’s support obligation), the payment shall be considered timely and any past due support shall not be converted to overdue support or subject to automated enforcement mechanisms.
(2) When nonpayment of the support order by the obligor causes overdue
support to accrue, the court may increase the order for income withholding
until the overdue support is paid in full. The court may also direct the employer
to withhold any periodic or lump sum distributions of income which may be
payable to the obligor in addition to regular income until further order of court.
(g) Priority of Income Withholding. If there are multiple support obligations
in effect against the income of the obligor, the court shall allocate among the
obligees the amount of income available for withholding, giving priority to curACTIONS FOR SUPPORT 231 Rule 1910.21
1910-56
(337892) No. 408 Nov. 08
rent child support, child support-related expenses and child support arrears to the
limit provided by law and stating the priority of payment to the obligee.
(h) Termination of Order for Income Withholding. An order for income withholding shall continue until dissolved by the court as provided by law.
Official Note: Pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S. § 4348(h), an order for income withholding may be
terminated when (1) the support obligation has terminated and the total arrears are paid; (2) the
payee cannot be located and it becomes impossible to forward payments; or (3) the result would
be unconscionable. The order may also be terminated administratively by the domestic relations
section.
Explanatory Comment—2008
New subdivision 1910.21(f)(1) is intended to address circumstances in which an employer timely
withholds income from an obligor pursuant to an income withholding order, but a delay occurs in
receipt of the funds by the State Collection and Disbursement Unit. In those cases, it would be inappropriate to consider the obligor’s payment as untimely and convert past due support to overdue support because an obligor subject to an income withholding order has no control over the timing of the
transmission of the funds from the employer. This new rule addreses solely timing issues by providing a 15-day grace period. It does not apply to obligors who are not subject to an order for income
withholding.

overdue obligation arises in another state, it shall be transmitted to the Department of Public Welfare Central Registry. Upon receipt and verification of the
amount owed, the Central Registry shall notify the appropriate domestic relations

IF YOU DO NOT APPEAR IN PERSON,
THE COURT MAY
ISSUE A WARRANT FOR YOUR ARREST
AND YOU MAY BE COMMITTED TO JAIL.
(3) If the court finds that you have willfully failed to comply with its order
for support, you may be found to be in contempt of court and committed to jail,
fined or both.
You will have the opportunity to disclose income, other financial information
and any relevant personal information at the conference/hearing so that the
court can determine if you have the ability to pay. You may also tell the court
about any unusual expenses that may affect your ability to pay. You may fill
out the enclosed Income Statement and Expense Statement forms and submit
them to the court.
At the conference/hearing, the contempt petition may be dismissed, new
and/or modified purge conditions may be imposed, or the judge may order you
to jail. If the obligee fails to appear, the court will proceed with the case and
enter an appropriate order.
YOU ARE REQUIRED TO BRING:
Your most recent pay stub for any and all employers
Payroll address, phone number, fax number and contact person
Proof of medical coverage
Any other documentation relevant to your case and the issue of contempt as

Official Note: Neither Rule 1018.1 (Notice to Defend) nor Rule 1361 (Notice to Plead)
apply to a petition for enforcement of support.
(c) The petition shall aver the facts alleged to constitute the failure to comply
with the support order. The petition shall set forth the amount of support arrearages, if any, as provided by the domestic relations section. Unless specially
ordered by the court, no answer to the petition is required.
(d) The petition shall be served upon the respondent
(1) by ordinary mail with the return address of the domestic relations section appearing thereon; or
(2) by any form of mail which requires the respondent to sign a receipt; or
(3) by a competent adult; or
Official Note: See Rule 76 for the definition of ‘‘competent adult.’’
(4) pursuant to special order of court. A respondent who attends the conference and/or hearing in person shall be deemed to have been served.
(e) The court may issue a bench warrant as provided by Rule 1910.13-1 for
failure of the respondent to appear.
(f) The respondent shall be advised in the Order/Notice to Appear that his or
her present ability to pay is a critical issue in the contempt proceeding. The
respondent shall be provided with Income and Expense Statements to demonstrate financial ability to pay. At the hearing, the respondent shall be provided the
opportunity to respond to any questions about his or her financial status. The trier
of fact shall issue an express finding that the respondent does or does not have
the present ability to pay.
Explanatory Comment—2012
The amendments to the form in subdivision (b) and new subdivision (f) are intended to assure
compliance with the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Turner v. Rogers, 131 S. Ct. 2507 (2011). In
that case, the Court held that counsel need not automatically be appointed for indigent support obligors facing incarceration in civil contempt proceedings. The Court held that the due process clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution does not require that counsel be provided where
the obligee is not represented by counsel and the state provides alternative procedural safeguards
including adequate notice of the importance of the ability to pay, a fair opportunity to present, and to
dispute, relevant information, and express court findings as to the obligor’s ability to pay.

In addition to any other remedy available to the court, the court may order the
respondent to obtain employment with income that can be verified and is subject
to income attachment. If the respondent willfully fails to comply with an order to
obtain such employment, the court may commit the respondent to jail upon adjudication for indirect criminal contempt, provided the respondent is afforded all of
the procedural safeguards available to criminal defendants.
Explanatory Comment—2007
Parental support of children is a fundamental requirement of law and public policy. Absent an
inability to maintain employment or acquire other income or assets, sanction in the form of incarceration may be imposed by the court to compel compliance and provide an incentive to obey the law.
ACTIONS FOR SUPPORT 231 Rule 1910.25-5
1910-64
(365298) No. 460 Mar. 13
The contempt process, which should be used as a last resort, is necessary to impose coercive sanctions upon those obligors whose circumstances provide no recourse to the court to compel payment
or a good faith effort to comply. Appellate opinions have made it clear that an obligor who is in civil
contempt cannot be incarcerated without the present ability to fulfill the conditions the court imposes
for release. However, the courts also have noted that recalcitrant obligors may be imprisoned for indirect criminal contempt if afforded the proper procedural safeguards. See Godfrey v. Godfrey, 894 A.2d
776 (Pa. Super. 2006); Hyle v. Hyle, 868 A.2d 601 (Pa. Super. 2005).

Explanatory Comment—1994
The support complaint and Income and Expense Statements contain a verification which states that
the documents are subject to the penalties of the Crimes Code relating to unsworn falsification to
authorities. A notary public is not needed.
Explanatory Comment—2006
Rule 1910.27(c) is amended to separate income and expense information and to elicit the expense
information relevant in cases that fall within the guidelines, as well as those that do not. In cases
which can be determined under the guidelines, no expense information need be provided unless a
party is claiming unusual needs and expenses that may warrant a deviation pursuant to Rule 1910.16-5
or an apportionment of expenses pursuant to Rule 1910.16-6. If a party is claiming such expenses,
the form at subsection (c)(2)(A) should be submitted. A separate expense form for cases in which the
parties’ combined monthly net income exceeds $20,000 is set forth at subsection (c)(2)(B).
Rule 1910.11(c) was amended, effective in March 1995, to provide that only income and extraordinary expenses need be shown on the Income and Expense Statement in cases which can be determined pursuant to the guidelines. The Explanatory Comment—1994 explained the rationale for the
amendment.
Nevertheless, because space for both income and expense information was provided on the same
form Income and Expense Statement, parties often needlessly expended time and effort to provide
expense information that was not relevant at the conference. The amendments are intended to clarify
and simplify the submission of expense information.
Explanatory Comment—2010
When the combined net monthly income of the parties exceeds $30,000, the case will be decided
pursuant to Rule 1910.16-3.1 and the Income Statement and the Expense Statement at Rule
1910.27(c)(2)(B) must be submitted.
Explanatory Comment—2012
The form complaint for support in subdivision (a) has been amended to accommodate cases initiated pursuant to Rule 1910.3(a)(6). Because a support order may be entered against either party without regard to which party initiated the support action pursuant to Rule 1910.3(b), a party who believes
that he or she may owe a duty of support may use the complaint form to initiate the action even if
he or she ultimately is determined to be the obligor. In active charging support cases in which there
is an overpayment in an amount in excess of two months of the monthly support obligation and the
domestic relations section fails to reduce the charging order automatically to recoup the overpayment
pursuant to Rule 1910.19(g)(1), the obligor may file a petition for recovery as set forth in subdivision
(h) above. A separate form petition has been added in subdivision (i) by which a former support obligor may seek recovery of an overpayment in any amount in terminated cases pursuant to Rule
1910.19(g)(2).

(365318) No. 460 Mar. 13 Copyright  2013 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
Rule 1910.29. Evidence in Support Matters.
(a) Record Hearing. Except as provided in this rule, the Pennsylvania Rules
of Evidence shall be followed in all record hearings conducted in an action for
support. A verified petition, affidavit or document, and any document incorporated by reference therein which would not be excluded under the hearsay rule if
given in person shall be admitted into evidence if (1) at least 20 days’ written
notice of the intention to offer them into evidence was given to the adverse party
accompanied by a copy of each document to be offered; (2) the other party does
not object to their admission into evidence; and (3) the evidence is offered under
oath by the party or witness. An objection must be in writing and served on the
proponent of the document within 10 days of the date of service of the notice of
intention to offer the evidence. When an objection is properly made, the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence shall apply to determine the admissibility of the document into evidence.
(b) Medical Evidence.
(1) Non-Record Proceeding. In a non-record hearing, if a physician has
determined that a medical condition affects a party’s ability to earn income and
that party obtains a Physician Verification Form from the domestic relations
section, has it completed by the party’s physician and submits it at the conference, it may be considered by the conference officer. If a party is receiving
Social Security disability or workers’ compensation benefits, the party shall
submit copies of the disability or workers’ compensation determination in lieu
of the Physician Verification Form.
(2) Record Proceeding. If the matter proceeds to a record hearing and the
party wishes to introduce the completed Physician Verification Form into evidence, he or she must serve the form on the other party not later than 20 days
after the conference. The other party may file and serve an objection to the
introduction of the form within 10 days of the date of service. If an objection
is made and the physician testifies, the trier of fact shall have the discretion to
allocate the costs of the physician’s testimony between the parties. If there is
no objection, the form may be admitted into evidence without the testimony of
the physician. In the event that the record hearing is held sooner than 30 days
after the conference, the trier of fact may provide appropriate relief, such as
granting a continuance to the objecting party.
(3) The Physician Verification Form shall be substantially in the following

23 Pa.C.S. § 4342(f) creates a hearsay exception in support actions to permit a verified petition,
affidavit or document and a document incorporated by reference in any of them to be admitted into
evidence if it would not otherwise be excluded as hearsay if given in person and it is admitted under
oath by a party or witness to the support action. Rule 1910.29 requires that notice of the documents
231 Rule 1910.29 GENERAL
1910-86
(365320) No. 460 Mar. 13 Copyright  2013 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
to be admitted be given to the other party prior to the hearing. It also sets forth the procedures for
raising an objection to the admission of those documents.
If the requisite 20-day notice is given and there is no objection, the document must be admitted
into evidence under this rule and 23 Pa.C.S. § 4342(f). In the event an objection is timely made, the
rules of evidence apply to determine the document’s ultimate admissibility.
Rule 1910.29 is not intended to affect 23 Pa.C.S. § 4342(g) and (h) relating to admissibility of
payment records, billing statements and bills for genetic testing and prenatal and postnatal health care
of the mother and child. Those documents are admissible into evidence without advance notice for
the limited purposes which are expressly set forth in those statutory provisions.

CUSTODY OF MINOR CHILDREN 231 Rule 1915.1
1915-1
(423383) No. 609 Aug. 25
(b) As used in this chapter, unless the context of a rule indicates otherwise,
the following terms shall have the following meanings:
‘‘action,’’ all proceedings for legal and physical custody and proceedings for
modification of prior orders of any court;
‘‘child,’’ an unemancipated individual under 18 years of age;
‘‘conference officer,’’ an individual who presides over an office conference
pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.4-2(a) or the initial non-record proceeding
under Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.4-3(a). For purposes of these rules, a conciliator is
synonymous with a conference officer;
‘‘custody,’’ the legal right to keep, control, guard, care for, and preserve a
child and includes the terms ‘‘legal custody,’’ ‘‘physical custody,’’ and ‘‘shared
custody;’’
‘‘hearing officer,’’ a lawyer who conducts a record hearing on partial custody
cases pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.4-2(b);
‘‘home county,’’ the county in which the child lived with either or both parents, a person acting as a parent, or in an institution for at least six consecutive
months immediately preceding the filing of the action, and in the case of a
child less than six months old, the county in which the child lived from birth
with any of the persons mentioned. A period of temporary absence of the child
from the physical custody of the parent, institution, or person acting as parent
shall not affect the six-month or other period;
‘‘in loco parentis,’’ a person who puts himself or herself in the situation of a
lawful parent by assuming the obligations incident to the parental relationship
without going through the formality of a legal adoption. The status of in loco
parentis embodies two ideas: (1) the assumption of a parental status; and (2)
the discharge of parental duties;
Official Note: See A.S. v. I.S., 130 A.3d 763, 766 n.3 (Pa. 2015).
‘‘legal custody,’’ the right to make major decisions on behalf of the child,
including, but not limited to, medical, religious, and educational decisions;
‘‘mediator,’’ an individual qualified under Pa.R.C.P. No. 1940.4 and who
assists custody litigants independently from the procedures set forth in
Pa.R.C.P. Nos. 1915.1—1915.25 by engaging the litigants in the alternative
dispute principles in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1940.2 to resolve custody matters in whole
or in part;
‘‘mediation,’’ the confidential process by which a neutral mediator assists the
parties in attempting to reach a mutually acceptable agreement on issues arising in a custody action. Mediation is not a court proceeding; rather, it is an
independent, non-record proceeding in lieu of court involvement for the purpose of assisting the parties to address the child’s best interest. An agreement
reached by the parties must be based on the voluntary decisions of the parties
and not the decision of the mediator. The agreement may resolve all or only
some of the disputed issues. The parties are required to mediate in good faith,
but are not compelled to reach an agreement. While mediation is an alternative
means of conflict resolution, it is not a substitute for the benefit of legal advice.
231 Rule 1915.1 GENERAL
1915-2
(423384) No. 609 Aug. 25 Copyright  2025 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
The participants in mediation shall be limited to the parties to the custody
action, primarily the child’s parents and persons acting as parents. Except as
provided in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1940.5(c), non-parties, including children, grandparents, and the parties’ attorneys, shall not participate in the mediation.
‘‘non-record proceeding,’’ the initial office conference set forth in Pa.R.C.P.
No. 1915.4-3. Mediation, as outlined in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1940.1—1940.9, shall
not be construed as a non-record proceeding;
‘‘partial physical custody,’’ the right to assume physical custody of the child
for less than a majority of the time;
‘‘person acting as a parent,’’ a person other than a parent, including an institution, who has physical custody of a child and who has either been awarded
custody by a court or claims a right to custody. See also the definition of in
loco parentis;
‘‘physical custody,’’ the actual physical possession and control of a child;
‘‘primary physical custody,’’ the right to assume physical custody of the child
for the majority of time;
‘‘relocation,’’ a change in a residence of the child that significantly impairs
the ability of a non-relocating party to exercise custodial rights;
‘‘shared legal custody,’’ the right of more than one individual to legal custody of the child;
‘‘shared physical custody,’’ the right of more than one individual to assume
physical custody of the child, each having significant periods of physical custodial time with the child;
‘‘sole legal custody,’’ the right of one individual to exclusive legal custody
of the child;
‘‘sole physical custody,’’ the right of one individual to exclusive physical
custody of the child; and
‘‘supervised physical custody,’’ custodial time during which an agency or an
adult designated by the court or agreed upon by the parties monitors the interaction between the child and the individual with those rights.
Official Note: The term ‘‘supervised visitation’’ in the prior statute has been replaced by
the term ‘‘supervised physical custody.’’
Official Note: The definitions of the terms of the various forms of legal custody and physical custody are taken from 23 Pa.C.S. § 5322(a).
For additional definitions, see the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act,
23 Pa.C.S. § 5402.

Rule 1915.2. Venue.
(a) An action may be brought in any county
(1) (i) which is the home county of the child at the time of commencement of the proceeding, or
(ii) which had been the child’s home county within six months before
commencement of the proceeding and the child is absent from the county but
a parent or person acting as parent continues to live in the county; or
(2) when the court of another county does not have venue under subdivision (1), and the child and the child’s parents, or the child and at least one parent or a person acting as a parent, have a significant connection with the county
other than mere physical presence and there is available within the county substantial evidence concerning the child’s protection, training and personal relationships; or
(3) when all counties in which venue is proper pursuant to subdivisions (1)
and (2) have found that the court before which the action is pending is the more
appropriate forum to determine the custody of the child; or
(4) when it appears that venue would not be proper in any other county
under prerequisites substantially in accordance with paragraph (1), (2) or (3);
or
(5) when the child is present in the county and has been abandoned or it is
necessary in an emergency to protect the child because the child or a sibling or
parent of the child is subjected to or threatened with mistreatment or abuse.
(b) Physical presence of the child or a party, while desirable, is not necessary
or sufficient to make a child custody determination except as provided in subdivision (a)(5) above.
(c) The court at any time may transfer an action to the appropriate court of
any other county where the action could originally have been brought or could
be brought if it determines that it is an inconvenient forum under the circumstances and the court of another county is the more appropriate forum. It shall be
the duty of the prothonotary of the court in which the action is pending to forward to the prothonotary of the county to which the action is transferred certified
copies of the docket entries, process, pleadings and other papers filed in the
action. The costs and fees of the petition for transfer and the removal of the
record shall be paid by the petitioner in the first instance to be taxable as costs in
the case.
Official Note: Under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, 23
Pa.C.S.A. § 5401 et seq., the court may decline to exercise its jurisdiction in a particular action
despite the action having been brought in a county of proper venue. Section 5426 of the act,
relating to simultaneous proceedings in other courts, provides for the mandatory refusal by the
court to exercise its jurisdiction in an action. Section 5427 of the act, relating to inconvenient
forum, and § 5428 of the act, relating to jurisdiction declined by reason of conduct, provide for
the discretionary refusal by the court to exercise its jurisdiction.
Explanatory Comment—2008
Subdivision (a) of Rule 1915.2 incorporates the categories of jurisdiction for initial custody determinations and temporary emergency proceedings in the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and
Enforcement Act at 23 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 5421 and 5424 as the venue provisions for these rules, restating
them in rule form without change in substance. Subdivision (a) follows the policy of § 5471 of the
Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, which provides that the provisions of the
act ‘‘allocating jurisdiction and functions between and among courts of different states shall also allocate jurisdiction and functions between and among courts of common pleas of this Commonwealth.’’

Comment—2020
Act of May 4, 2018, P.L. 112, No. 21, amended 23 Pa.C.S. § 5324 by adding a new class of thirdparty standing for individuals seeking custody of a child whose parents do not have care and control
of the child. The individual seeking custody may or may not be related to the child. Subject to Section 5324(5), the newly added standing provision requires that: (1) the individual has assumed or is
willing to assume responsibility for the child; (2) the individual has a sustained, substantial, and sincere interest in the child’s welfare; and (3) the child’s parents do not have care and control of the
child. A plaintiff proceeding under Section 5324(4) shall satisfy the requirements of that provision by
clear and convincing evidence. Additionally, if a juvenile dependency proceeding has been initiated,
or is ongoing, or there is an order for permanent legal custody, Section 5324(5) provides that an individual cannot assert standing under Section 5324(4).
Consistent with the Act 21 of 2018 statutory changes, subdivision (e) has been revised to include
a third party seeking custody of a child under 23 Pa.C.S. § 5324(4). The subdivision has been reorganized to sequentially follow the statutory provisions in 23 Pa.C.S. §§ 5324(2)—(4) and 5325.
Similarly, the Complaint for Custody Paragraph 9 in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.15(a) has been reorganized
to sequentially follow the statutory provisions and rules sequence, as well. See Pa.R.C.P. No.
1915.15(a).

Comment:
There is no obligation for the court to conduct an independent investigation of the criminal record
or abuse history of a party or the party’s household member.
The intent of subdivision (a)(4) is for the parties to have the most current information available,
including after a final order—provided the child remains under the court’s jurisdiction.
As used in subdivision (a), a ‘‘child custody action’’ is intended to include any action where custody is sought to be awarded, including a protection from abuse action. An Criminal Record/Abuse
History Verification form is not required in a protection from abuse action if custody is not sought.
See 23 Pa.C.S. § 5322 (defining ‘‘household member’’).
For subdivision (c)(6), see Pa.R.Civ.P. 1930.5 (discovery in domestic relations matters) and Pa.R.E.
614 (court’s calling or examining a witness).
Given the sensitive nature of the record, see Pa.R.Civ.P. 1930.1 (form of caption and applicability

after receiving the submission.
(e) Dissemination. Upon receipt of the completed form, the court shall
promptly docket and disseminate it to the parties.
(f) Confidentiality. The completed form shall be confidential and not publicly
accessible. Further dissemination by the recipients of the form is in violation of
23 Pa.C.S. Ch. 63 (Child Protective Services Law).
(g) Witnesses. The parties may subpoena with leave of court, or the court may
otherwise order, the county agency to provide a witness or witnesses to attend

Comment:
This rule is intended to implement 23 Pa.C.S. § 5329.1.

Rule 1915.4. Prompt Disposition of Custody Cases.
(a) Initial Contact With the Court. Depending upon the procedure in the judicial district, the parties’ initial in-person contact with the court (including, but not
limited to a conference with a conference officer pursuant to Rule 1915.4-2, a
conference with a judge, conciliation, mediation and/or class/seminar) shall be
scheduled to occur not later than 45 days from the filing of a complaint or petition.
(b) Listing Trials Before the Court. Depending upon the procedure in the
judicial district, within 180 days of the filing of the complaint either the court
shall automatically enter an order scheduling a trial before a judge or a party shall
file a praecipe, motion or request for trial, except as otherwise provided in this
subdivision. If it is not the practice of the court to automatically schedule trials
and neither party files a praecipe, motion or request for trial within 180 days of
filing of the pleading, the court shall, sua sponte or on motion of a party, dismiss
the matter unless a party has been granted an extension for good cause shown, or
the court finds that dismissal is not in the best interests of the child. The extension shall not exceed 60 days beyond the 180 day limit. A further reasonable
extension may be granted by the court upon agreement of the parties or when the
court finds, on the record, compelling circumstances for a further reasonable
extension. If an extension is granted and, thereafter, neither party files a praecipe,
motion or request for trial within the time period allowed by the extension, the
court shall, sua sponte or on the motion of a party, dismiss the matter unless the
court finds that dismissal is not in the best interests of the child. A motion to dismiss, pursuant to this rule, shall be filed and served upon the opposing party. The
opposing party shall have 20 days from the date of service to file an objection. If
no objection is filed, the court shall dismiss the case. Prior to a sua sponte dismissal, the court shall notify the parties of an intent to dismiss the case unless an
objection is filed within 20 days of the date of the notice.
(c) Trial. Trials before a judge shall commence within 90 days of the date the
scheduling order is entered. Trials and hearings shall be scheduled to be heard on
CUSTODY OF MINOR CHILDREN 231 Rule 1915.4
1915-21
(423399) No. 609 Aug. 25
consecutive days whenever possible but, if not on consecutive days, then the trial
or hearing shall be concluded not later than 45 days from commencement.
(d) Prompt Decisions. The judge’s decision shall be entered and filed within
15 days of the date upon which the trial is concluded unless, within that time, the
court extends the date for such decision by order entered of record showing good
cause for the extension. In no event shall an extension delay the entry of the
court’s decision more than 45 days after the conclusion of trial.
(e) Emergency or Special Relief. Nothing in this rule shall preclude a party
from seeking, nor a court from ordering, emergency or interim special relief at
any time after the commencement of the action.

Rule 1915.4-1. Alternative Hearing Procedures for Partial Custody
Actions.
(a) A custody action shall proceed as prescribed by Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.4-3
unless the court, by local rule, adopts the alternative hearing procedure authorized
by Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.4-2 pursuant to which an action for partial custody may
be heard by a hearing officer, except as provided in subdivision (b).
(b) Promptly after the parties’ initial contact with the court as set forth in
Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.4(a), a party may move the court for a hearing before a judge,
rather than a hearing officer, in an action for partial custody where:
(1) there are complex questions of law, fact or both; or
(2) the parties certify to the court that there are serious allegations affecting the child’s welfare.
(c) The president judge or the administrative judge of the family division of
each county shall certify that custody proceedings generally are conducted in
accordance with either Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.4-2 or Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.4-3. The
certification shall be filed with the Domestic Relations Procedural Rules Committee of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and shall be substantially in the following form:

Explanatory Comment
These rules provide an optional procedure for using hearing officers in partial custody cases. The
procedure is similar to the one provided for support cases in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1910.12: a conference,
record hearing before a hearing officer and argument on exceptions before a judge. The terms ‘‘conference officer’’ and ‘‘hearing officer’’ have the same meaning here as in the support rules.
It is important to note that use of the procedure prescribed in Pa.R.C.P. Nos. 1915.4-1 and 1915.4-2
is optional rather than mandatory. Counties which prefer to have all partial custody cases heard by a
judge may continue to do so.
These procedures are not intended to replace or prohibit the use of any form of mediation or conciliation. On the contrary, they are intended to be used in cases which are not resolved through the
use of less adversarial means.
The intent of the 2007 amendments to Pa.R.C.P. Nos. 1915.4-1 and 1915.4-2, and Pa.R.C.P. No.
1915-4.3, was to clarify the procedures in record and non-record custody proceedings. When the first
proceeding is non-record, no exceptions are required and a request for a de novo hearing may be
made.
In lieu of continuing the practice of including in the Note a 67-county list identifying the hearing
procedure selected by the local county court, the list can now be found on the Domestic Relations
Procedural Rules Committee website.

Rule 1915.4-2. Partial Custody. Office Conference. Hearing. Record.
Exceptions. Order.
(a) Office Conference.
(1) The office conference shall be conducted by a conference officer.
(2) If the respondent fails to appear at the conference before the conference
officer as directed by the court, the conference may proceed without the
respondent.
(3) The conference officer may make a recommendation to the parties
relating to partial custody or supervised physical custody of the child or children. If an agreement for partial custody or supervised physical custody is
reached at the conference, the conference officer shall prepare a written order
in conformity with the agreement for signature by the parties and submission
to the court together with the officer’s recommendation for approval or disapproval. The court may enter an order in accordance with the agreement without
hearing the parties.
CUSTODY OF MINOR CHILDREN 231 Rule 1915.4-2
1915-23
(423401) No. 609 Aug. 25
(4) At the conclusion of the conference, if an agreement relating to partial
custody or supervised physical custody has not been reached, the parties shall
be given notice of the date, time and place of a hearing before a hearing officer, which may be the same day, but in no event shall be more than forty-five
days from the date of the conference.
(b) Hearing.
(1) The hearing shall be conducted by a hearing officer who must be a
lawyer, and a record shall be made of the testimony. A hearing officer who is
a lawyer employed by, or under contract with, a judicial district or appointed
by the court shall not practice family law before a conference officer, hearing
officer, or judge of the same judicial district.
(2) The hearing officer shall receive evidence and hear argument. The
hearing officer may recommend to the court that the parties and/or the subject
child or children submit to examination and evaluation by experts pursuant to
Rule 1915.8.
(3) Within ten days of the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer
shall file with the court and serve upon all parties a report containing a recommendation with respect to the entry of an order of partial custody or supervised
physical custody. The report may be in narrative form stating the reasons for
the recommendation and shall include a proposed order, including a specific
schedule for partial custody or supervised physical custody.
(4) Within twenty days after the date the hearing officer’s report is mailed
or received by the parties, whichever occurs first, any party may file exceptions
to the report or any part thereof, to rulings on objections to evidence, to statements or findings of fact, to conclusions of law, or to any other matters occurring during the hearing. Each exception shall set forth a separate objection precisely and without discussion. Matters not covered by exceptions are deemed
waived unless, prior to entry of the final order, leave is granted to file exceptions raising those matters. If exceptions are filed, any other party may file
exceptions within twenty days of the date of service of the original exceptions.
(5) If no exceptions are filed within the twenty-day period, the court shall
review the report and, if approved, enter a final order.
(6) If exceptions are filed, the court shall hear argument on the exceptions
within forty-five days of the date the last party files exceptions, and enter an
appropriate final order within fifteen days of argument. No motion for PostTrial Relief may be filed to the final order.
Explanatory Comment—2006
The time for filing exceptions has been expanded from ten to twenty days. The purpose of this
amendment is to provide ample opportunity for litigants and counsel to receive notice of the entry of
the order, to assure commonwealth-wide consistency in calculation of time for filing and to conform
to applicable general civil procedural rules.

Rule 1915.4-3. Non-Record Proceedings. Trials.
(a) Non-Record Proceedings. In judicial districts utilizing an initial nonrecord proceeding, i.e., office conference, if an agreement is not finalized by the
conclusion of the proceeding, the conference officer shall promptly notify the
court that the matter should be listed for trial. A lawyer employed by, or under
contract with, a judicial district or appointed by the court to serve as a conference officer to preside over a non-record proceeding shall not practice family law
before a conference officer, hearing officer, or judge of the same judicial district.
(b) Trial. The trial before the court shall be de novo. The court shall hear the
case and render a decision within the time periods set forth in Pa.R.C.P. No.
1915.4.
Explanatory Comment—2018
The amendment to this rule, in conjunction with the amendment to Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.1, standardizes terminology used in the custody process and identifies court personnel by title and in some cases
qualifications. Of note, the term ‘‘mediator,’’ which had been included in the rule, has been omitted
and is specifically defined in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.1.
As in the support rules, custody conference officers preside over conferences and hearing officers
preside over hearings. Regardless of the individual’s title, presiding over a conference or a hearing
triggers the family law attorney practice preclusion in this rule and in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.4-2(b) in
the case of a hearing officer. Mediators, as defined in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.1 and as qualified in
Pa.R.C.P. No. 1940.4, do not preside over custody conferences or hearings; rather, mediators engage
custody litigants in alternative dispute resolution methods pursuant to Chapter 1940 of the Rules of
Civil Procedure and, as such, the preclusion from practicing family law in the same judicial district
in which an attorney/mediator is appointed is inapplicable.

Rule 1915.4-4. Pre-Trial Procedures.
(a) Pre-Trial Conference.
(1) The court shall schedule a pre-trial conference before a judge in an initial custody or modification proceeding at the request of a party or by the court
sua sponte.
(2) The pre-trial conference scheduling procedure shall be as follows:
(i) If a party wishes to request a pre-trial conference, the party shall file
a praecipe set forth in subdivision (h).
(ii) A party may file the praecipe any time after a custody conciliation
or conference unless a pre-trial conference has already been scheduled or
held.

(iv) The pretrial conference may be scheduled at any time, but shall be
scheduled at least 30 days prior to trial.
(b) Pre-Trial Statement.
(1) Not later than five days prior to the pre-trial conference, each party
shall file a pre-trial statement with the prothonotary and serve a copy upon the
court and the other party or the party’s counsel.
(2) The pre-trial statement shall include, together with any additional information required by special order of the court, the following matters:
(i) the name and address of each expert whom the party intends to call
as a witness at trial;
(ii) the name and address of each person the party intends to call as a
witness at trial and the relationship of that witness to the party. Inclusion of
a witness on the pre-trial statement constitutes an affirmation that the party’s
counsel or the self-represented party has communicated with the witness
about the substance of the witness’s testimony prior to the filing of the pretrial statement; and
(iii) a proposed order setting forth the custody schedule requested by the
party.
(c) Exhibits. In addition to subdivision (b)(2), the party shall include any
proposed exhibits to be introduced at trial, including the expert’s report, as part
of the pre-trial statement served upon the other party or other party’s counsel, but
the proposed exhibits shall not be included with the pre-trial statement served
upon the court.
(d) Sanctions. If a party fails to file a pre-trial statement or otherwise comply
with the requirements of subdivisions (b) and (c), the court may sanction the
party as provided in Pa.R.Civ.P. 4019(c)(2) and (c)(4).
(e) Amendments. Unless the court orders otherwise, the parties may amend a
pretrial statement at any time, but not less than seven days before trial.
(f) Topics. The court shall consider the following topics at the pre-trial conference:
(1) issues for resolution by the court;
(2) unresolved discovery matters;
(3) agreements of the parties;
(4) issues relating to expert witnesses;
(5) settlement or mediation of the case;
(6) a party’s or household member’s criminal record or abuse history or a
party’s, household member’s, or child’s involvement with the juvenile dependency court or the children and youth social service agency as outlined in
23 Pa.C.S. §§ 5329 and 5329.1, including the admissibility of related documents, other evidentiary issues, or testimony;
(7) such other matters that may aid in the disposition of the case; and
(8) if a trial date has not been scheduled, the court shall schedule the trial
at the pre-trial conference.

Historical Commentary
The following commentary related to Pa.R.Civ.P. 1915.4-4 is historical in nature and represents
statements of the Committee at the time of rulemaking:
Explanatory Comment
In 2013, the Domestic Relations Procedural Rules Committee (the ‘‘Committee’’) recognized there
was a wide disparity in pre-trial procedures in custody cases among the various judicial districts. By
adopting this rule, the Supreme Court established uniform state-wide pre-trial procedures in custody
cases. With an eye toward reducing custody litigation, the rule encourages early preparation and court
involvement for purposes of expedited resolutions. The rule was based upon the pretrial procedures
in divorce cases as set forth in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1920.33(b). The rule does not affect, however, the First
Judicial District’s practice of conducting a pre-trial conference upon the filing of a motion for a protracted or semi-protracted trial.
In 2015, the Committee expressed concern the rule as previously adopted by the Supreme Court
allowed for an interpretation contrary to the intent of the rule. The Committee proposed and the Court
adopted an amendment to the rule to clarify the rule’s mandate as it relates to witnesses. As a goal of
any pre-trial conference is to settle the case, in whole or in part, the Committee believed a best practice in reaching that goal is having a thorough knowledge of the case, including the substance of
anticipated witness testimony. As amended, the rule plainly states that counsel or a self-represented
party is required to discuss with the witness their testimony prior to including the witness on the pretrial statement.
Unlike Pa.R.C.P. No. 1920.33(b), the rule does not require inclusion of a summary of the witness’s
testimony in the pre-trial statement; but rather, an affirmation by counsel or self-represented party that
there was actual communication with each witness about the witness’s testimony. With the additional
information from witnesses, counsel, self-represented parties, and the trial court can better engage in
more fruitful settlement discussions at the pre-trial conference.

Rule 1915.5. Question of Jurisdiction, Venue, or Standing. Counterclaim
Discovery. No Responsive Pleading by Defendant Required.
(a) Question of Jurisdiction, Venue, or Standing.
(1) A party shall raise jurisdiction of the person or venue by preliminary
objection.
(2) A party may raise standing by preliminary objection or at a custody
hearing or trial.
(3) The court may raise standing sua sponte.
(4) In a third-party plaintiff custody action in which standing has not been
resolved by preliminary objection, the court shall address the third-party plaintiff’s standing and include its standing decision in a written opinion or order.
Official Note: The court may raise at any time a question of (1) jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action or (2) the exercise of its jurisdiction pursuant to Section 5426 of the
Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, relating to simultaneous proceedings
in other courts, Section 5427, relating to inconvenient forum, and Section 5428, relating to
jurisdiction declined by reason of conduct. The Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and
Enforcement Act, 23 Pa.C.S. § 5407, provides that, upon request of a party, an action in which
a question of the existence or exercise of jurisdiction is raised shall be given calendar priority
and handled expeditiously.
(b) A party may file a counterclaim asserting the right of physical or legal
custody within 20 days of service of the complaint upon that party or at the time
of hearing, whichever first occurs. The claim shall be in the same form as a complaint as required by Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.3.
(c) There shall be no discovery unless authorized by special order of court.
Official Note: The rule relating to discovery in domestic relations matters generally is
Pa.R.C.P. No. 1930.5.
(d) Except as set forth in subdivisions (a) and (b), a responsive pleading shall
not be required. If a party files a responsive pleading, it shall not delay a hearing
or trial.
Explanatory Comment—1994
Under subdivision (a), the defendant may but is not required to plead to the complaint. All averments may be disputed by the defendant at the custody hearing. An attorney who wished to file
another pleading may do so. However, the action is not to be delayed to permit its filing.
Comment—2020
Act of May 4, 2018, P.L. 112, No. 21, amended 23 Pa.C.S. § 5324 by adding a new class of thirdparty standing for individuals seeking custody of a child whose parents do not have care and control
of the child. Subject to the limitations in 23 Pa.C.S. § 5324(5), the newly added standing provision
requires that: (1) the individual has assumed or is willing to assume responsibility for the child; (2)
the individual has a sustained, substantial, and sincere interest in the child’s welfare; and (3) the
child’s parents do not have care and control of the child. A plaintiff proceeding under Section 5324(4)
shall satisfy the requirements of that provision by clear and convincing evidence.
Typically, when a third party is seeking custody of a child, the child’s parents can raise the issue
of the third party’s standing to pursue custody. However, Section 5324(4) permits a party to seek custody of a child only when the child’s parents do not have care and control of the child. If the parents’
lack of care and control also results in their non-participation in the custody litigation, the third par231 Rule 1915.5 GENERAL
1915-28
(423406) No. 609 Aug. 25 Copyright  2025 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
ty’s standing may go unchallenged. Subdivision (a) has been amended by including two new subdivisions to address this circumstance. Subdivision (a)(3) permits the court to raise standing sua sponte
and, if third-party standing is not resolved by preliminary objection, the court shall address the standing issue in its written opinion or order as required by subdivision (a)(4).

Rule 1915.6. Joinder of Parties.
(a)(1) If the court learns from the pleadings or any other source that a parent
whose parental rights have not been previously terminated or a person who has
physical custody of the child is not a party to the action, it shall order that the
person be joined as a party. Such person shall be served with a copy of all prior
pleadings and notice of the joinder substantially in the form prescribed by Rule
1915.16(a).
(2) The person joined must file any objection to the order of joinder within
twenty days after notice of the order.
(3) The person joined may file a counterclaim asserting a right to physical
or legal custody in the form required for a complaint by Rule 1915.3. A copy
of the counterclaim shall be served upon all other parties to the action as provided by Rule 440.
(b) If the court learns from the pleadings or any other source that any other
person who claims to have custodial rights with respect to the child is not a party
to the action, it shall order that notice be given to that person of the pendency of
the action and of the right to intervene therein. The notice shall be substantially
in the form prescribed by Rule 1915.16(b).
Explanatory Comment—1994
The position taken by the rules is that a person in physical custody of the child and a parent whose
parental rights have not been terminated are necessary parties to a custody determination. While it
may be desirable to have other persons who claim custody rights as parties to the action, their joinder
is not a prerequisite to a custody determination.

Rule 1915.7. Consent Order.
If the parties have an agreement regarding custody and request that the court
enter a consent order incorporating the agreement’s terms:
(a) the parties shall submit to the court a proposed custody order bearing the
parties’ written consent; or
(b) the parties may state the agreement on the record, provided that:
(1) within ten days of placing the agreement on the record, the parties
comply with subdivision (a); or
(2) the court memorializes the oral agreement from the record into a written custody order.

that are subject to the Case Records Public Access Policy of the Unified Judicial System of
Pennsylvania.
See Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.10(b) regarding written custody order requirements.
Explanatory Comment—2019
The rule has been amended to ensure that when a custody agreement is orally placed on the record
that a written custody order prepared by the parties memorializing the parties’ agreement is timely
submitted to the court or the court memorializes the oral agreement into a written custody order. The
amendment avoids the untenable circumstance that the only written record of the parties’ oral agreement is a transcription of what had been placed on the record. Transcription agreements are often
cumbersome and difficult to discern as to the custody terms and provisions, which makes enforcement
difficult. This amendment is consistent with the holding in R.L.P. v. R.F.M., 110 A.3d 201 (Pa. Super.
2015).

Rule 1915.8. Physical and Mental Examination of Persons.
(a) The court may order the child(ren) and/or any party to submit to and fully
participate in an evaluation by an appropriate expert or experts. The order, which
shall be substantially in the form set forth in Rule 1915.18, may be made upon
the court’s own motion, upon the motion of a party with reasonable notice to the
person to be examined, or by agreement of the parties. The order shall specify the
place, manner, conditions and scope of the examination and the person or persons
by whom it shall be made and to whom distributed. In entering an order directing
an evaluation pursuant to this rule, the court shall consider all appropriate factors
including the following, if applicable:
(1) the allocation of the costs, including insurance coverage, if any, attendant to the undertaking of the evaluation and preparation of the resultant report
and court testimony of any appointed expert;
(2) the execution of appropriate authorizations and/or consents to facilitate
the examination;
(3) any deadlines imposed regarding the completion of the examination
and payment of costs;
(4) the production of any report and of underlying data to counsel and/or
any unrepresented party upon the completion of the examination; and
(5) any additional safeguards that are deemed appropriate as a result of the
alleged presence of domestic violence and/or child abuse.
(b) Unless otherwise directed by the court, the expert shall deliver to the
court, to the attorneys of record for the parties, to any unrepresented party, and to
the guardian ad litem and/or counsel for the child, if any, copies of any reports
arising from the evaluation setting out the findings, results of all tests made,
diagnosis and conclusions. No reports shall be filed of record or considered evidence unless and until admitted by the court. Any report which is prepared at the
request of a party, with or without a court order, and which a party intends to
introduce at trial, must be delivered to the court and the other party at least thirty
days before trial. If the report or any information from the evaluator is provided
231 Rule 1915.8 GENERAL
1915-30
(423408) No. 609 Aug. 25 Copyright  2025 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
to the court, the evaluator shall be subject to cross-examination by all counsel and
any unrepresented party without regard to who obtains or pays for the evaluation.
(c) If a party refuses to obey an order of court made under subdivision (a) of
this rule, the court may make an order refusing to allow the disobedient party to
support or oppose designated claims or defenses, prohibiting the party from
introducing in evidence designated documents, things or testimony, prohibiting
the party from introducing evidence of physical or mental condition, or making
such other order as is just. The willful failure or refusal of a party to comply with
an order entered pursuant to this rule may also give rise to a finding of contempt
and the imposition of such sanctions as may be deemed appropriate by the court,
including, but not limited to, an adverse inference against the non-complying
party.
(d) A petition for contempt alleging failure to comply with an order entered
pursuant to subdivision (a) of this rule shall be treated in an expedited manner.
Explanatory Comment—2007
This rule addresses the process for any number of expert evaluations a court may order in a custody case, including, but not limited to, physical, mental health, custody and/or drug and alcohol
evaluations, and/or home studies. Since the initial promulgation of this rule in 1981, the frequency of
utilizing professionals as expert witnesses in child custody litigation has increased considerably. In
appropriate cases, evaluations have served as a means to provide the court with a full and complete
record and to facilitate settlement of the litigation.
The proposed revisions to Rule 1915.8 are intended to afford the trial court and the parties a more
flexible and case-sensitive means of determining the scope and parameters of a physical and/or mental examination, including deadlines, costs, underlying data, and access. In many instances, the previous sixty-day deadline was impractical and ignored. While some cases demanded that the evaluation be completed in less than 60 days, others demanded far more time than that. The revisions to this
rule also specifically permit the trial court to draw an adverse inference from one party’s failure to
comply with an order pursuant to this rule.

Rule 1915.9. No Default Judgment.
No judgment may be entered by default or on the pleadings.
Rule 1915.10. Decision. Order.
(a) Decision.
(1) The court may decide custody before the testimony has been transcribed.
(2) The court shall state the reasons for its decision:
(i) on the record in open court; or
(ii) in a written opinion or order.
(b) Order. The court shall enter a custody order as a separate written order or
in a written opinion as a separate section.
(1) The court’s order shall sufficiently state specific terms to enforce the
order.
(2) If the court finds a history of abuse of the child or a household member by a party, or a present risk of harm to the child or an abused party, the
court’s order shall include:
(i) safety provisions for the protection of the endangered party or the
child;
CUSTODY OF MINOR CHILDREN 231 Rule 1915.9
1915-30.1
(423409) No. 609 Aug. 25
(ii) the reason for imposing the safety provisions and why they are in
the best interest of the child or abused party; and
(iii) if past abuse was committed by a party, why unsupervised physical
custody is in the best interest of the child.
(3) The court may order that the case caption use the parties’ initials rather
than the parties’ names based on the sensitive nature of the facts in the case
record and the child’s best interest.
(4) When drafting a written opinion or order in an action having the parties’ initials in the case caption, the court shall:
(i) avoid using specific identifiers for people, places, or things that may
indirectly reveal the child’s identity; and
(ii) use generalized identifiers when describing a child’s school, activities, affiliated organizations, or other similar terms.
(c) Party Obligations. A custody order shall include a notice outlining the
parties’ obligations under:
(1) 23 Pa.C.S. § 5337, regarding a party’s intention to relocate with a
minor child; and
(2) Pa.R.Civ.P. 1915.3-2(a)(4), regarding a party’s ongoing obligation to
complete, serve, and file, if required, the Criminal Record/Abuse History Verification form.
(d) No Post-Trial Relief. A party shall not file a motion for post-trial relief to
an order of legal or physical custody.
Comment:
See 23 Pa.C.S. § 5323(d) (requiring the court to delineate the reasons for its decision on the record
in open court or in a written opinion or order).
See Pa.R.Civ.P. 1930.1(a)(2) (permitting the court to order that the case caption contain the parties’
initials rather than their names in custody actions).
See 23 Pa.C.S. § 5323(c) (requiring that an order include notice of a party’s obligations under
§ 5337, relating to relocation) and Pa.R.Civ.P. 1915.17 (outlining the requirements for the proposed
relocation of a child’s residence).
Subdivision (b) sets forth requirements of 23 Pa.C.S. § 5323(e)(1). Examples of safety provisions
include, but are not limited to, professional supervised physical custody, a supervised or neutral custody exchange location, a neutral third-party present at custody exchanges, telephone or computerfacilitated contact with the child, no direct contact between the parties, third-party contact for cancellations, third-party transportation, and designating a secure, neutral location as repository for a child’s
passport. A party may seek review by petition of the risk of harm and need for continued supervision
pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S. § 5323(e)(2). For a presumption of supervised physical custody and safety
provisions, see 23 Pa.C.S. § 5323(e.1).
Additionally, subdivision (b) requires a court to enter a custody order as a separate written order
or in a separate section of a written opinion. The subdivision also addresses the practice of orally
entering a custody order on the record without formalizing the custody order in writing. In such circumstances, the parties’ only documentation of the custody order is a transcription of the oral record.
In R.L.P. v. R.F.M., 110 A.3d 201 (Pa. Super. 2015), the Superior Court held that ‘‘in order to be sufficiently specific to be enforced, an order of custody must be entered as a separate written order, or
as a separate section of a written opinion.’’ Id. at 206. Despite the Superior Court’s decision, the practice of placing custody orders on the record without subsequently entering a written order has continued, which has been problematic for enforcement and understanding of the agreement’s or order’s
terms.
Pursuant to subdivision (b)(2), the court may initialize a custody action’s case caption if the child’s
privacy may be compromised by the sensitive nature of the facts in the case record. If the court determines that the case caption should be initialized, additional privacy safeguards are required under
subdivision (b)(3).
Subdivision (b)(3) recognizes that inadvertent disclosure of the child’s identity and privacy may
occur if the written custody order or opinion provides specific details of the child’s life, i.e., school,
extracurricular activities. Subdivision (b)(3) requires that the court refrain from using specific identi231 Rule 1915.10 GENERAL
1915-30.2
(423410) No. 609 Aug. 25 Copyright  2025 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
fiers; instead, the court should use general terms, e.g., ‘‘high school,’’ not ‘‘John F. Kennedy High
School.’’ In circumstances in which name specificity is required, such as school choice, the court
should consider a separate order for that issue.
Under no circumstance does a party’s filing of an updated Criminal Record/Abuse History Verification form impose a duty on the court to review, respond, or react to a newly revealed criminal
record or abuse history unless a party petitions the court for relief.
Historical Commentary
The following commentary related to Pa.R.Civ.P. 1915.10 is historical in nature and represents
statements of the Committee at the time of rulemaking:
Explanatory Comment—2019
Subdivision (b) further defines and reinforces the requirements in 23 Pa.C.S. § 5323(e). Examples
of safety provisions include, but are not limited to, supervised physical custody, a supervised or neutral custody exchange location, a neutral third-party present at custody exchanges, telephone or
computer-facilitated contact with the child, no direct contact between the parties, third-party contact
for cancellations, third-party transportation, and designating a secure, neutral location as repository for
a child’s passport.
Additionally, subdivision (b) requires a court to enter a custody order as a separate written order
or in a separate section of a written opinion. The subdivision also addresses the practice of orally
entering a custody order on the record without formalizing the custody order in writing. In such circumstances, the parties’ only documentation of the custody order is a transcription of the oral record.
In R.L.P. v. R.F.M., 110 A.3d 201 (Pa. Super. 2015), the Superior Court held that ‘‘in order to be sufficiently specific to be enforced, an order of custody must be entered as a separate written order, or
as a separate section of a written opinion.’’ Id. at 206. Despite the Superior Court’s decision, the practice of placing custody orders on the record without subsequently entering a written order has continued, which has been problematic for enforcement and understanding of the agreement’s or order’s
terms.
Explanatory Comment—2021
Subdivision (b)(3) allows the court discretion to initialize a custody action’s case caption when the
child’s privacy may be compromised by the sensitive nature of the facts in the case record. When the
court determines that the case caption should be initialized, additional privacy safeguards are required
under subdivision (b)(4).
Subdivision (b)(4) recognizes that inadvertent disclosure of the child’s identity and privacy may
occur if the written custody order or opinion provides specific details of the child’s life (i.e., school,
extracurricular activities). Subdivision (b)(4) requires that the court refrain from using specific identifiers; instead, the court should use general terms (i.e., high school, not John F. Kennedy High
School). In circumstances in which name specificity is required, such as school choice, the court
should consider a separate order for that issue.

(a) Appointing Child’s Attorney.
(1) Upon its own motion or a party’s motion, the court may appoint an
attorney to represent a child who is the subject of the action.
(2) The court’s order appointing the child’s attorney, as provided in
Pa.R.Civ.P. 1915.19, may apportion to the parties the reasonable cost of the
child’s attorney.
(3) The child’s attorney:
CUSTODY OF MINOR CHILDREN 231 Rule 1915.11

(423411) No. 609 Aug. 25
(i) shall represent the child’s legal interest;
(ii) shall zealously represent the child as any other client in an attorneyclient relationship; and
(iii) shall not act as the child’s guardian ad litem or best interest attorney as provided in Pa.R.Civ.P. 1915.11-2.
(b) Child Interview.
(1) The court may interview a child in open court or in chambers.
(2) If the court interviews the child, the court shall conduct the child’s
interview on the record.
(3) If permitted by the court, a party’s attorney or a party may observe the
interview.
(4) As part of the interview process, the court shall permit either:
(i) the parties’ attorneys to question the child under the court’s supervision, provided that all parties are represented by an attorney; or
(ii) a party’s attorney or a self-represented party to submit to the court
written questions, which the court may include in its interview.
(c) Child Attending Proceedings. Unless ordered by the court or otherwise
compelled to testify on the record, a child’s attendance at a conference, hearing,
or trial is not required.
Comment—1991
Pa.R.Civ.P. 1915.15(c) provides a form of order to appear at a conference or hearing in a custody
action.
However, the presence of a child in court is not always necessary or desirable. The experience may
be traumatic and disruptive. Consequently, the child should not be required to attend a hearing or
conference in every case. When the presence of a child is required and the custodial party does not
voluntarily bring the child, the court may issue an order for the child’s attendance.
Subdivision (c) has been added to Pa.R.Civ.P. 1915.11 to provide that, in the absence of an order
of court, a child who is the subject of the action need not be brought to a conference or a hearing
before the court. The form of order to appear provided by Pa.R.Civ.P. 1915.15(c) has been revised to
implement this policy.
Comment—2022
Although the rule states that a child is not required to attend a conference, hearing, or trial, the terminology used by a judicial district may vary for these court proceedings. The rule’s intent is to limit
the child’s participation to only those proceedings in which the child will actively participate as a witness or in the court’s interview.

(c) the court finds that a party to the action has been the victim of a
personal injury crime, as defined in 23 Pa.C.S. § 3103, which was perpetrated by a party to the action.
(ii) In the hearing, the court may consider abuse occurring beyond the

Rule 1915.11-2. Guardian Ad Litem.
(a) Appointment.
CUSTODY OF MINOR CHILDREN 231 Rule 1915.11-2
1915-30.9
(423417) No. 609 Aug. 25
(1) On its own motion or a party’s motion, the court may appoint a guardian ad litem if the court finds that the appointment is necessary for determining
the child’s best interest.

guardian ad litem may apportion to the parties the reasonable cost of the
guardian ad litem.
(b) Qualifications. The guardian ad litem shall be a licensed attorney or
licensed mental health professional.
(c) Duties.
(1) As provided in 23 Pa.C.S. § 5334, which has been suspended in part
by Pa.R.Civ.P. 1915.25, the guardian ad litem shall perform the duties as enumerated in Section 5334, including representing the child’s best interest.
(2) The guardian ad litem shall not represent the child’s legal interest or act
as the child’s legal counsel.
(d) Report. The guardian ad litem shall prepare a written report, which shall
include specific recommendations relating to the child’s best interest.
(1) Child’s Statement.
(i) The written report may include a subject child’s statement to the
guardian ad litem that would be otherwise inadmissible as hearsay under the
Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence, provided the requirements of Pa.R.E. 703
are satisfied.
(ii) A child’s statement included in the written report under subdivision
(d)(1)(i) shall not be considered substantive evidence.
(2) The guardian ad litem shall file the written report with the prothonotary, which shall become part of the record.
(3) Confidential. The guardian ad litem’s filed report and a party’s filed
response to the report as provided in subdivision (d)(5) shall be confidential
and shall not constitute a public record.
(4) The guardian ad litem shall provide the report to the parties and the
court when filed but not later than 20 days prior to a hearing or trial or as otherwise ordered by the court.
(5) Comments. Objections.
(i) Within ten days of receiving the guardian ad litem’s report, a party
may file with the prothonotary and serve on the other party and the court:
(A) a comment to the report, which shall become part of the record; or
(B) an objection to the report’s admissibility, in whole or in part,
including a subject child’s statement to the guardian ad litem.
(ii) The court shall determine the report’s admissibility prior to the
hearing or trial.
(6) Subject to Pa.R.Civ.P. 1915.11, a party may subpoena:
(i) an individual interviewed by the guardian ad litem or identified in
the report to appear and testify at the hearing or trial; or
231 Rule 1915.11-2 GENERAL
1915-30.10
(423418) No. 609 Aug. 25 Copyright  2025 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
(ii) the guardian ad litem for the production of a document relied upon

(1) When determined necessary by the trial court, the guardian ad litem

under subdivision (e)(3)(i) shall not be considered substantive evidence.
(f) Order. The order appointing a guardian ad litem shall be substantially in
the form set forth in Pa.R.Civ.P. 1915.21.
Comment:
Subdivision (a)(1) states that the guardian ad litem may be appointed when ‘‘the appointment is
necessary.’’ Such appointments should be limited to extraordinary cases in which the trial judge determines that the level of conflict is unusually high or that the parties will be absolutely unable to provide the court with the information necessary to evaluate and determine the subject child’s best interests. Regardless of appointment of a GAL, the duty and responsibility to determine the best interests
of the children involved lies solely with the trial judge.
The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania suspended 23 Pa.C.S. § 5334 insofar as it (1) requires that a
guardian ad litem be an attorney, (2) permits the guardian ad litem to represent both the best interests
and legal interests of the child, (3) provides the guardian ad litem the right to examine, cross-examine,
present witnesses, and present evidence on behalf of the child, and (4) prohibits the guardian ad litem
from testifying.
See 23 Pa.C.S. § 5336, prohibiting disclosure of certain records and information to parents and
parties.
Subdivision (d)(1) and (e)(3) reference the requirements of Pa.R.E. 703. Rule 703 relates to the
bases for expert opinion testimony. While the requirements of Rule 703 must be satisfied for any
written report that includes statements made by a subject child, the guardian ad litem is not an expert
witness and need not be qualified as an expert prior to testifying. However, the guardian ad litem
In addition, the guardian ad litem cannot serve as a mere conduit for hearsay or for the opinions
of another person, including the subject child. The guardian ad litem cannot relate the opinion of a
non-testifying witness unless the guardian ad litem has reasonably relied upon it. Upon appropriate
objection from any party, the trial court shall strike any testimony or portion of the guardian ad litem’s
written report that is inadmissible as hearsay if the requirements for Pa.R.E. 703 are not met.
Subdivision (d)(6) provides that a party may subpoena an individual interviewed by the guardian
ad litem, an individual that is identified in the guardian ad litem’s report, or a document relied upon
by the guardian ad litem in producing the report. The subdivision shall not be construed to limit a
CUSTODY OF MINOR CHILDREN 231 Rule 1915.11-2

(423419) No. 609 Aug. 25
party’s ability to subpoena other individuals or for the production of documents for a trial or hearing,
or for discovery purposes, if the court had previously authorized discovery pursuant to Pa.R.Civ.P.
1915.5(c). remains subject to questions and cross-examination regarding qualifications and experience.

Explanatory Comment—1981
Rule 1915.13 contains a broad provision empowering the court to provide special relief where
appropriate. In a custody proceeding, such special relief might include relief in the nature of a writ of
ne exeat, directing the parties not to leave the jurisdiction and not to remove the child from the jurisdiction.
The rule catalogs several types of relief which might be granted, including the entry of a temporary order of custody, partial custody or visitation. The rule specifically provides that the power of
the court to grant special relief shall not be limited to the types of relief cataloged.

The form of complaint is appropriate if there is one plaintiff, one defendant, and the custody of
one child is sought or the custody of several children is sought, and the information required by Paragraphs 3 to 7 is identical for all of the children. If there are more than two parties, the complaint
should be appropriately adapted to accommodate them. If the custody of several children is sought
and the information required is not identical for all of the children, the complaint should contain a
separate paragraph for each child.
Pa.R.Civ.P. 1930.1(b) may require attorneys or unrepresented parties to file confidential documents
and documents containing confidential information that are subject to the Case Records Public Access
Policy of the Unified Judicial System of Pennsylvania.
Historical Commentary
The following commentary related to Pa.R.Civ.P. 1915.15 is historical in nature and represents
statements of the Committee at the time of rulemaking:
CUSTODY OF MINOR CHILDREN 231 Rule 1915.15
1915-30.19
(423427) No. 609 Aug. 25
Explanatory Comment—2008
In an effort to promote uniformity of practice throughout the Commonwealth, several forms are
included in the rules. Two aspects of these forms are worthy of mention. First, much of the information which must be set forth in the complaint is required by the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction
and Enforcement Act, 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 5429. Second, the complaint is verified by use of a statement
that it is subject to the penalties of the Crimes Code relating to unsworn falsification to authorities.
A notary public is not needed.
Explanatory Comment—2020
Act of May 4, 2018, P.L. 112, No. 21, amended 23 Pa.C.S. § 5324 by adding a new class of thirdparty standing for individuals seeking custody of a child whose parents do not have care and control
of the child. The individual seeking custody may or may not be related to the child. Subject to the
limitations in 23 Pa.C.S. § 5324(5), the newly added standing provision requires that: (1) the individual has assumed or is willing to assume responsibility for the child; (2) the individual has a sustained, substantial, and sincere interest in the child’s welfare; and (3) the child’s parents do not have
care and control of the child. A plaintiff proceeding under Section 5324(4) shall satisfy the requirements of that provision by clear and convincing evidence. Additionally, if a juvenile dependency proceeding has been initiated, or is ongoing, or if there is an order for permanent legal custody, Section
5324(5) provides that an individual cannot assert standing under Section 5324(4).
Consistent with the Act’s statutory change, the Complaint for Custody Paragraph 9 has been
revised to include a third party seeking custody of a child under 23 Pa.C.S. § 5324(4) and has been
reorganized to sequentially follow the statutory provisions in 23 Pa.C.S. §§ 5324(2)—(4) and 5325.
Similarly, Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.3(e) has been reorganized to sequentially follow the statutory provision
sequence. See Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.3(e).

Explanatory Comment—2021
Subdivision (a)(1) requires that the parties’ full names are used in a domestic relations case caption
unless the court determines it necessary to protect the child’s identity by initializing the case caption
in a custody action based on sensitive facts in the case and the child’s best interest. Generally, a child
custody case does not include sensitive information or egregious facts that would cause embarrassment to a child and necessitate exceptional privacy measures; however, in the unusual circumstance
that a custody action has egregious facts that may cause an issue for the child, the trial court would
have the discretion to initialize the caption in order to maintain the child’s privacy interests.
Subdivision (a)(2) provides the exception to the general rule in subdivision (a)(1) for a custody
action in which the court deems that the child could be adversely affected by the sensitive nature of
the facts in the record. In a custody case in which the trial court determines the child’s best interest
requires an initialized caption, Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915-10(b)(4) requires that additional privacy safeguards
are in the written custody order or opinion entered by the court.
The rule’s requirement that a case caption use the parties’ full names does not alter a party’s or an
attorney’s responsibilities under the Case Records Public Access Policy of the Unified Judicial System of Pennsylvania and subdivision (b).

The provisions of this Chapter 1940 adopted October 28, 1999, effective immediately, 30 Pa.B.
5820, unless otherwise noted.
Rule 1940.1. Applicability of Rules to Mediation.
The rules in this chapter shall apply to all court-established custody mediation
programs and to any court-ordered mediation of individual custody cases.
Rule 1940.2. Definitions.
As used in this Chapter, the following terms shall have the following meanings:
‘‘Mediation,’’ the confidential process by which a neutral mediator assists the
parties in attempting to reach a mutually acceptable agreement on issues arising in a custody action. Mediation is not a court proceeding; rather, it is an
independent, non-record proceeding in lieu of court involvement for the purpose of assisting the parties to address the child’s best interest. An agreement
reached by the parties must be based on the voluntary decisions of the parties
and not the decision of the mediator. The agreement may resolve all or only
some of the disputed issues. The parties are required to mediate in good faith
but are not compelled to reach an agreement. While mediation is an alternative
means of conflict resolution, it is not a substitute for the benefit of legal advice.
The participants in mediation shall be limited to the parties to the custody
action, primarily the child’s parents and persons acting as parents. Except as
provided in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1940.5(c), non-parties, including children, grandparents, and the parties’ attorneys, shall not participate in the mediation.
Official Note: See Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.1 for the definition of a person acting as a parent.
‘‘Memorandum of Understanding,’’ the written document prepared by a
mediator that contains and summarizes the resolution reached by the parties
during mediation. A Memorandum of Understanding is primarily for the benefit of the parties and is not legally binding on either party.
‘‘Orientation Session,’’ the initial process of educating the parties on the
mediation process so that they can make an informed choice about continued
participation in mediation. This process may be mandated by the court and may
be structured to include either group or individual sessions. An orientation sesVOLUNTARY MEDIATION IN CUSTODY MATTERS 231 Rule 1940.1
1940-1
(390565) No. 522 May 18
sion may also include an educational program for parents and children on the
process of divorce and separation and the benefits of mediation in resolving
custody disputes.

The provisions of this Rule 1940.2 amended February 8, 2018, effective April 1, 2018, 48 Pa.B.
1095. Immediately preceding text appears at serial page (305183).
Rule 1940.3. Order for Orientation Session and Mediation. Selection of
Mediator.
(a) Except as provided in (b), the court may order the parties to attend an orientation session at any time upon motion by a party, stipulation of the parties, or
the court’s own initiative.
(b) The court may not order an orientation session if a party or a child of
either party is or has been the subject of domestic violence or child abuse either
during the pendency of the action or within 24 months preceding the filing of the
action.
Official Note: See also Rule 1940.6(a)(4) requiring termination of mediation when the
mediator finds that the proceeding is ‘‘inappropriate’’ for mediation. The mediator has a continuing ethical obligation, consistent with Rule 1940.4(b), during the mediation to screen for abuse
and to terminate the mediation in the event he or she determines that the abuse renders the case
unsuitable for mediation.
(c) Following the orientation session and with the consent of the parties, the
court may refer the parties to mediation. The mediation may address any issues
agreed to by the parties unless limited by court order.
Rule 1940.4. Minimum Qualifications of the Mediator.
(a) A mediator must have at least the following qualifications:
(1) a bachelor’s degree and practical experience in law, psychiatry, psychology, counseling, family therapy or any comparable behavioral or social
science field;
(2) successful completion of basic training in domestic and family violence
or child abuse and a divorce and custody mediation program approved by the
Association for Conflict Resolution, American Bar Association, American
Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, or Administrative Office of Pennsylvania
Courts;
(3) mediation professional liability insurance; and

(4) the nature and extent of any relationships with the parties and any personal, financial, or other interests that could result in a bias or conflict of interest;

Explanatory Note
The 1978 amendments to the Deposition and Discovery Rules represent the culmination of a continuing and comprehensive review of the operation of the 1950 Rules and of the Federal Discovery
and Deposition Rules as completely revised in 1970.
The Pennsylvania Rules have never been identical with the Federal Rules. From the beginning, it
was felt that the differences between federal and state practice did not permit any such identity. Also,
the difference in the amounts involved in federal cases and in state cases had an important effect
twenty-five years ago. The 1970 federal revisions effected even wider differences, particularly in the
discovery of reports, memoranda, statements or other things secured in anticipation of litigation or in
preparation for trial.
More than twenty-five years of experience and the general acceptance of the philosophy of discovery justify bringing the Pennsylvania system into as close conformity as possible with the federal system. The differences between state and federal practice still prevent absolute identity.
The Federal Rules as last revised have been used as a model, but the Civil Procedural Rules Committee has not hesitated to depart from Federal language where it has acquired a questionable gloss
or has received inconsistent interpretations in the courts.
It was considered important to retain as far as possible the rule numbering and the internal
arrangement of the Pennsylvania Rules. Since 1950, the Rules have been the subject of numerous
decisions, commentary, and articles. Many of the Rules are left unchanged. The advantages of retaining the present Rule numbers as closely as possible far outweigh any benefits of a so-called ‘‘functional’’ rearrangement which would require a complete new numbering system.
231 GENERAL
4000-2
(361796) No. 454 Sep. 12 Copyright  2012 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
New material is introduced by the use of decimal numbering. Certain Rules have been subdivided,
e.g., 4003.1, 4003.2, etc. This retains the numbering of Rules dealing with particular subject matter.
Federal source material is identified in the detailed discussion of the amendments which follows.
The amendments recognize that no effective system of discovery can be designed which is not
subject to abuse, resulting in delay, expense and the burden on judges of disposing of dilatory
motions, petitions and objections without real merit.
The amendments have not ignored the recent criticisms directed to the federal discovery procedures, particularly the capacity for abusive discovery with its escalation of costs and delay of adjudication. Nor have they ignored the recent proposals of the American Bar Association’s Special Committee of the Section of Litigation. These proposals, even if ultimately adopted by the United States
Supreme Court, would not appear to be of sufficient significance, in view of the differences between
state and federal practice, to delay the promulgation of these amendments. If any of the proposals of
the American Bar Association should ultimately be adopted as amendments to the Federal Rules and
found appropriate to Pennsylvania practice, further amendments to these Rules can easily be made.
Most of these problems can be avoided by self discipline of the bar and by more effective judicial
administration. Sanctions are available for disobedience of an order compelling compliance with the
Rules. Although there is an understandable reluctance on the part of bench and bar to request or to
impose sanctions, particularly sanctions against counsel, it may be necessary to do so from time to
time to make the system work. Also, assignment to an individual judge who would regulate the entire
course of the discovery proceedings, especially in large and complex cases, could help prevent dilatory, burdensome or oppressive conduct. It will also serve to reduce the possibility of inconsistent rulings by different judges during the course of discovery. Frequent pre-trial conferences in complex
cases should help.
The final text of the amendments profited from the many valuable criticisms and suggestions which
followed the circulation of Recommendation No. 44. All suggestions received from the bench and bar
were reviewed by the Civil Procedural Rules Committee and many of them were incorporated in the
amendments.
Before proceeding to a detailed analysis of the amendments, a brief outline of some of the major
changes may be helpful.
First, the scope of discovery is broadened to conform closely to the Federal Rules. The scope of
discovery under our 1950 Rules was limited to ‘‘any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the
subject matter involved in the action and will substantially aid in the preparation of the pleadings or
the preparation or trial of the case.’’
Under the Federal Rules, discovery may be obtained as to ‘‘any matter, not privileged, relevant to
the subject matter’’ and it ‘‘is not ground for objection that the information sought’’ is not itself relevant if it ‘‘appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.’’
The amendments do not include the recent proposal of the American Bar Association’s Section of
Litigation for an amendment to Fed. R. Civ.P. 26(b) to restrict discovery to matters ‘‘relevant to the
issues’’ rather than ‘‘relevant to the subject matter.’’ It has been suggested that the proposal for
amendment would prevent fishing expeditions. Adequate machinery already exists under both the
Federal and our Rules to prevent such abuse. Further, the ABA proposal runs the risk of increasing
preliminary disputes over the propriety of discovery, since the ‘‘issues’’ may not be subject to accurate definition until after discovery is complete.
Second, Rule 4011(d), which has prohibited discovery of the existence or location of reports,
memoranda, statements, information or other things made or secured in anticipation of litigation or in
preparation for trial, has been rescinded.
Trial preparation material, including statements of witnesses whether taken by a lawyer or investigator, will now be fully discoverable, except that the mental impressions of a party’s attorney or his
DEPOSITIONS AND DISCOVERY 231
4000-3
(302587) No. 352 Mar. 04
conclusions, opinions, memoranda, notes or summaries, legal research or legal theories are protected
from discovery. The representatives of a party other than the party’s attorney are protected from disclosure of mental impressions, conclusions or opinions respecting the value or merit of a claim or
defense or respecting strategy or tactics.
A witness will now be entitled, merely upon request, to receive a copy of his own statement from
the party in possession of it, and a party will now be entitled to a copy of his own statement plus
copies of all statements of all witnesses in the possession of an adverse party.
Third, Rules 4011(f) which has regulated discovery of expert testimony has also been rescinded. In
its place, Rule 4003.5 provides for discovery from expert witnesses and limits the use at trial of expert
witnesses whose identity has been withheld or of testimony which is inconsistent with the disclosures
in the discovery proceedings.
Fourth, present Rule 4009 governing the production of documents and things and inspection of
property is revised to conform to Fed. R.Civ.P. 34. A written request for production or inspection will
now suffice; a court order is no longer required to initiate a production or inspection.
Fifth, the burden of ascertaining the proper officers, agents or employees of large organizations to
be deposed is substantially reduced. If the party seeking discovery discloses with reasonable particularity the matter on which he seeks to depose the witnesses, the organization is required to designate
the officers, directors, agents or others who will testify as to those matters.
Sixth, the burden of answering interrogatories requesting information to be derived or ascertained
from the records of the answering party may be met by specifying the records which contain the
information and offering the inquiring party reasonable opportunity to inspect and copy the same, if
the burden of deriving the information from the records would be substantially the same for both parties. This enlarges the Federal Rule by making it applicable to all records; the Federal Rule applies
only to ‘‘business’’ records.
Seventh, the federal provisions for sequence and timing of discovery, not now dealt with in our
prior Rules, are included in the amended Rules.
Eighth, the scope of requests for admissions and interrogatories to parties is enlarged. They are no
longer objectionable if they require an answer which involves an opinion or contention that relates to
a fact or the application of law to fact. This follows the Federal Rule. The effect of failure to admit
is clarified and pre-trial procedures for determining the extent of an admission are provided.
Ninth, the use at trial of an oral deposition of a medical witness, other than a party, is broadened
to permit its use whether or not the witness is available to testify. The prior practice permitted this
only as to videotape depositions.
Tenth, the time periods prescribed by the prior Rule for the doing of any act are revised to conform
to those prescribed by the Federal Rules.
Finally, the Rules are expressly made applicable to eminent domain proceedings. They are also
applicable in divorce and in support and custody proceedings to the extent provided by the rules governing those proceedings.
The details of the amendments follow.
[Detailed notes follow their respective Rules.]
Rule 4001. Scope. Definitions.
(a) The rules of this chapter apply to any civil action or proceeding brought
in or appealed to any court which is subject to these rules including any action
pursuant to the Eminent Domain Code of 1964 or the Municipal Claims Act of
1923.
231 Rule 4001 GENERAL
4000-4
(302588) No. 352 Mar. 04 Copyright  2004 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
Official Note: Rule 1701(b)(4) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure permits a
lower court to authorize the taking of depositions or the preservation of testimony in the interest
of justice after an appeal is taken. The procedure under these rules is applicable to such depositions.
See Rule 1930.5 governing discovery in domestic relations matters and specifying when leave
of court is and is not required. See also Rules 1910.9 and 1915.5(c) governing discovery in
actions for support and custody, respectively.
(b) As used in this chapter, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise,
‘‘court’’ means the court in which the action is pending;
‘‘deposition’’ includes a deposition upon written
‘‘trial’’ includes a hearing before arbitrators or viewers.
Official Note: These rules apply to an action pending in the court of common pleas and
referred to compulsory arbitration under Section 7361 of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. § 7361.
(c) Subject to the provisions of this chapter, any party may take the testimony
of any person, including a party, by deposition upon oral examination or written
interrogatories for the purpose of discovery, or for preparation of pleadings, or for
preparation or trial of a case, or for use at a hearing upon petition, motion or rule,
or for any combination of the foregoing purposes.
Official Note: See Rule 4003.8 governing pre-complaint discovery.
(d) Subject to the provisions of this chapter, any party may obtain discovery
by one or more of the following methods: depositions upon oral examination
(Rule 4007.1) or written interrogatories (Rule 4004); written interrogatories to a
party (Rule 4005); production of documents and things and entry for inspection
and other purposes (Rule 4009); physical and mental examinations (Rule 4010);
and requests for admission (Rule 4014).
Official Note: Under subdivision (d), for example, a party may discover documents and
things in the possession of a person not a party by means of a subpoena duces tecum issued in
connection with a deposition upon oral examination under Rule 4007.1, a subpoena for the production of documents and things under Rule 4009.21 et seq., and an independent action.
Explanatory Note
The amendments to Rule 4001 are designed to achieve three principal purposes. First, to designate
specifically the actions and proceedings subject to the Rules. Second, to designate the purposes of a
deposition and of discovery. Third, to provide at the outset as does amended Fed. R.Civ.P. 26(a), a
catalogue of the armory of discovery procedures available. (Rule 4001(d))
Before the amendment, Rule 4001(a) stated a scope which included ‘‘any civil action or proceeding at law or in equity brought in or appealed to any court which is subject to these rules.’’ Taken
literally, these words embrace every conceivable form of action. They are unchanged by these amendments. However, the application of the Rules to eminent domain and to divorce, custody and support
proceedings was not uniform. The amendments clarify the application of the Rules to those proceedings.
Viewers’ proceedings to assess damages in eminent domain actions were historically brought in the
Courts of Quarter Sessions, which were courts not originally subject to the Rules of Civil Procedure.
Even after the enactment of the Eminent Domain Code of 1963, vesting jurisdiction over eminent
domain proceedings in the unified Common Pleas Court, Sec. 703(2) of the Eminent Domain Code
DEPOSITIONS AND DISCOVERY 231 Rule 4001
4000-5
(330301) No. 397 Dec. 07
provided only for limited discovery of experts’ valuation reports on appeal to the Common Pleas,
provided they had not already testified before the viewers. The Code made no provision whatsoever
for discovery for use in the initial proceedings before viewers. The viewers’ proceedings were the
discovery proceedings. This often left litigants at a disadvantage before the viewers, in some cases
leading to needless appeals.
The amendment to Rule 4001(a) makes clear that the entire chapter of deposition and discovery
proceedings applies at all stages of an eminent domain action.
‘‘Trial’’ is defined in Rule 4001(b) specifically to include proceedings before ‘‘viewers’’ and also
‘‘arbitrators.’’
Control of the deposition and discovery procedure at the viewers’ and arbitrators’ stage will remain
in the court. The viewers and arbitrators are not empowered to grant protective orders, impose sanctions or to take other action authorized by the Rules. The court in its order appointing viewers might
consider establishing a cut-off date for completion of discovery so that the viewers’ hearings will not
be unduly delayed. Or the viewers could set a cut-off date for hearing to afford opportunity for discovery.
In the Orphans’ Court Division, Supreme Court Orphans’ Court Rule 3.6 provides that the local
Orphans’ Courts by general rule or special order may prescribe the practice relating to depositions,
discovery, production of documents, and perpetuation of testimony. To the extent not provided by
general rule or special order, the Orphans’ Court Rule provides that the practice relating to such matters shall conform to the practice in the trial or civil division of the local Court of Common Pleas. As
a result, some courts have adopted local rules which require leave of court in all Orphans’ Court
Division cases. Others limit discovery in varying degrees. Others have adopted no local rules, thereby
incorporating these Rules in toto. Under a unified court system and statewide practice, this lack of
uniformity is undesirable. However, the Orphans’ Court Rules are independent and cannot be regulated by the Civil Procedural Rules.
Where leave of court is required, application for leave is required in each individual proceeding. A
local rule authorizing discovery in all cases without an individual application and a hearing would be
inconsistent with the Rule. Further, it would be inconsistent with statewide practice and would permit
non-uniformity of practice in the important area of discovery and depositions.
Leave of court is further discussed in Rule 4007.2.
The Committee considered but rejected the radical suggestion that all depositions and discovery,
except depositions of aged, infirm, or going witnesses, should require leave of court. While this suggestion would undoubtedly limit the possibility of abusive discovery, it would add enormously to the
burden on court and counsel. Multiple petitions, answers, briefs and hearings would be required in
practically every case. This is unjustifiable. The courts, through protective orders and sanctions,
should be able to control abuse of the discovery process. The limited use of leave of court in specific
actions strikes a more equitable balance.
Sub-divisions (c) and (d), which state the permissible purposes of depositions and discovery, and
list the procedural devices available, effect no change. They consolidate stylistically the existing practice.
Explanatory Note—1999
Rule of Civil Procedure 4001(a) was amended in 1997 to eliminate reference to discovery in the
domestic relations actions of support, custody of minor children and divorce or annulment of marriage. Discovery in those actions is governed by Rule 1930.5.

Rule 4002. Agreement Regarding Discovery or Deposition Procedure.
The parties may by agreement (1) provide that depositions may be taken before
any person, at any time or place, upon any notice, and in any manner, and when
so taken may be used like other depositions, and (2) modify the procedures provided by these rules for methods of discovery.
Official Note: See Rule 201 for advisability of writing.
Explanatory Note
The amendments of this Rule make two changes in present practice.
First, they enlarge the rights of the parties by permitting them to agree to modify the procedures
for discovery as well as for the taking of depositions. This will be broader than Fed. R. Civ.P. 29 as
amended in 1970. The Federal Rule requires court approval of any agreement to extend the time for
responses in three instances during the discovery stage. The amendments to Rule 4002 do not incorporate this limitation. The need for leave of court to extend time may act as a spur to prompt
responses but it must be balanced against the need for conservation of judicial manpower of already
overburdened courts. Busy judges normally approve stipulations of counsel with respect to extrajudicial matters at the early stages of litigation. Little will be gained as a practical matter by requiring
leave, and the need for hearing could actually accentuate delay. If one party agrees to give his opponent extra time to answer, why should the judge intervene and refuse?
Second, the phrase ‘‘stipulate in writing’’ in the prior Rule is changed to read ‘‘by agreement.’’
This will validate the common practice during the taking of oral depositions of dictating various
stipulations to the reporter for inclusion in the transcript. Technically such a stipulation is not an

‘‘agreement in writing’’ within the meaning of the Business of the Court Rule 201 and is not an
agreement ‘‘at bar’’ since no judge is present and the deposition is not taken in a courtroom.
Counsel will be well advised to confirm such agreements in writing to avoid misunderstandings.

Rule 4003.1. Scope of Discovery Generally. Opinions and Contentions.
(a) Subject to the provisions of Rules 4003.2 to 4003.5 inclusive and Rule
4011, a party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, which is
relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action, whether it relates to
the claim or defense of the party seeking discovery or to the claim or defense of
any other party, including the existence, description, nature, content, custody,
condition and location of any books, documents, or other tangible things and the
identity and location of persons having knowledge of any discoverable matter.
(b) It is not ground for objection that the information sought will be inadmissible at the trial if the information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead
to the discovery of admissible evidence.
(c) Except as otherwise provided by these rules, it is not ground for objection
that the information sought involves an opinion or contention that relates to a fact
or the application of law to fact.
Official Note: Interrogatories that generally require the responding party to state the basis
of particular claims, defenses or contentions made in pleadings or other documents should be
used sparingly and, if used, should be designed to target claims, defenses or contentions that the
propounding attorney reasonably suspects may be the proper subjects of early dismissal or resolution or, alternatively, to identify and to narrow the scope of claims, defenses and contentions
made where the scope is unclear.
DEPOSITIONS AND DISCOVERY 231 Rule 4002.1
4000-7
(333801) No. 403 Jun. 08
Explanatory Note
Prior Rule 4003 has been deleted. It had embodied a number of disparate subjects, including the
deposition of aged, infirm and going witnesses, the deposition of witnesses more than 100 miles from
the courthouse, depositions for use at a hearing on a petition, motion or rule, and notice of depositions on oral examination. These subjects have been functionally rearranged and transposed to other
Rules.
Depositions of aged, going and infirm witnesses and witnesses more than 100 miles from the
courthouse are now regulated by Rule 4007.2(b). The use of depositions at a hearing on petition,
motion or rule is authorized by Rule 4001(c). Notice of depositions on oral examination is now regulated by Rule 4007.1.
Under the prior practice, an argument might have been made that there was no sanction available
against a party who refused to appear for a deposition for use in connection with a petition, motion
or rule. The amendments preclude any such argument, since there is now a unified notice system for
all oral depositions for all purposes. See Rules 4001(c), 4007.1 and 4019(a)(1).
To use the place vacated by Rule 4003, new Rules 4003.1 through 4003.5 have been added. They
deal with the scope of discovery. Rule 4003.1 delineates generally the scope of discovery. It is taken
almost verbatim from Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b).
Rules 4003.2 through 4003.5 deal with specific aspects of the scope of discovery, such as discovery of insurance, discovery of trial preparation material generally, discovery of statements of parties
or witnesses, and discovery of facts known and opinions held by experts. They are based closely on
Fed. R.Civ.P. 26(b)(2), (3) and (4). Separate comment on each new Rule follows.
Rule 4003.1 incorporates the broad Federal discovery rule and replaces former Rule 4007(a), which
had provided a more limited scope of discovery. Rule 4007(a) limited discovery to any matter not
privileged which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the action and ‘‘will substantially aid in
the preparation of the pleadings or the preparation or trial of the case.’’ Fed. R.Civ.P. 26(b)(1), from
which Rule 4003.1 is taken almost verbatim, permits discovery of all relevant matter not privileged,
whether it relates to a claim or defense. It is not restricted to preparation of pleadings or the trial of
the case. It is not ground for objection that the information sought will be inadmissible at the trial if
the information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to discovery of admissible evidence.
Further widening of the scope of discovery follows from the deletion of former Rules 4011(d) and
4011(f), which restricted discovery of material prepared for trial or in anticipation of litigation and
discovery of expert opinions. The effect of these omissions is discussed in the comments to Rules
4003.3, 4003.4 and 4003.5.

A party may obtain discovery of the existence and terms of any insurance
agreement under which any person carrying on an insurance business may be
liable to satisfy part or all of a judgment which may be entered in the action or
to indemnify or reimburse for payments made to satisfy the judgment. Information concerning the insurance agreement is not by reason of such disclosure
admissible in evidence at trial. For the purposes of this paragraph, an application
for insurance shall not be treated as part of an insurance agreement.

Rule 4003.3. Scope of Discovery. Trial Preparation Material Generally.
Subject to the provisions of Rules 4003.4 and 4003.5, a party may obtain discovery of any matter discoverable under Rule 4003.1 even though prepared in
anticipation of litigation or trial by or for another party or by or for that other
party’s representative, including his or her attorney, consultant, surety, indemnitor, insurer or agent. The discovery shall not include disclosure of the mental
impressions of a party’s attorney or his or her conclusions, opinions, memoranda,
notes or summaries, legal research or legal theories. With respect to the representative of a party other than the party’s attorney, discovery shall not include disclosure of his or her mental impressions, conclusions or opinions respecting the
value or merit of a claim or defense or respecting strategy or tactics.
Explanatory Note
The amended Rule radically changes the prior practice as to discovery of documents, reports and
tangible things prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial by or for another party or by or for
that party’s representative, including his attorney, consultant, surety, indemnitor, insurer or agent.
Former Rule 4011(d) expressly prohibited such discovery. The amended Rule permits it, subject to
the limitation that discovery of the work product of an attorney may not include disclosure of the
mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, memoranda, notes, legal research or legal theories of an
attorney. As to any other representative of a party, it protects the representative’s disclosure of his
mental impressions, conclusions or opinions respecting the value or merit of a claim or defense or
respecting strategy or tactics. Memoranda or notes made by the representative are not protected.
The essential purpose of the Rule is to keep the files of counsel free from examination by the
opponent, insofar as they do not include written statements of witnesses, documents or property which
belong to the client or third parties, or other matter which is not encompassed in the broad category
of the ‘‘work product’’ of the lawyer. Documents, otherwise subject to discovery, cannot be immunized by depositing them in the lawyer’s file. The Rule is carefully drawn and means exactly what it
says. It immunizes the lawyer’s mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, memoranda, notes, summaries, legal research and legal theories, nothing more.
There are, however, situations under the Rule where the legal opinion of an attorney becomes a
relevant issue in an action; for example, an action for malicious prosecution or abuse of process where
the defense is based on a good faith reliance on a legal opinion of counsel. The opinion becomes a
relevant piece of evidence for the defendant, upon which defendant will rely. The opinion, even
though it may have been sought in anticipation of possible future litigation, is not protected against
discovery. A defendant may not base his defense upon an opinion of counsel and at the same time
claim that it is immune from pre-trial disclosure to the plaintiff.
As to representatives of a party, and sometimes an attorney, there may be situations where his conclusions or opinion as to the value or merit of a claim, not discoverable in the original litigation,
DEPOSITIONS AND DISCOVERY 231 Rule 4003.3
4000-9
(255391) No. 296 Jul. 99
should be discoverable in subsequent litigation. For example, suit is brought against an insurance carrier for unreasonable refusal to settle, resulting in a judgment against the insured in an amount in
excess of the insurance coverage. Here discovery and inspection should be permitted in camera where
required to weed out protected material.
In two respects the amended Rule differs materially from Fed. R.Civ.P. 26(b)(3). First, the Federal
Rule permits discovery only when the party seeking discovery shows substantial need of the materials in the preparation of his case and is unable, without undue hardship, to obtain a substantial
equivalent of the materials by other means. Under the general provisions of Rule 4003.3, such a
showing of substantial need and undue hardship will not be required. Note, however, that under Rule
4003.5(a)(3), governing discovery of opinions of an expert who is not expected to be called as a witness at trial, a showing of exceptional circumstances under which it is impracticable to obtain facts
or opinions on the subject matter by other means is required.
The federal draftsmen have justified the special showing of need on the ground that
‘‘each side’s informal evaluation of its case should be protected, that each side should be encouraged
to prepare independently, and that one side should not automatically have the benefit of the detailed
preparatory work of the other side.’’ The Committee, after long and careful deliberation, rejected this
view which would impose more court time on lawyers and additional burdens on judges in the motion
court. At the same time it also rejected a proposal to go to the opposite extreme and direct the mandatory exchange of all pretrial material, statements, medical reports and experts’ reports under penalty of sanctions.
Second, the work product protection of the Rule distinguishes between that afforded the attorney
and that afforded the party’s representative. They are on an equal footing under the Federal Rules.
The Committee viewed the work product privilege enunciated by the United States Supreme Court in
Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 67 S.Ct. 385, 91 L.Ed. 451 (1947), as stating a special rule applicable to lawyers which need not necessarily be the same as that applied to other representatives, particularly insurance investigators. Under the Rule, a lawyer’s notes or memoranda of an oral interview
of a witness, who signs no written statement, are protected but the same notes or memoranda made
by an insurance investigator will not be protected. A signed statement of the witness is, of course,
always discoverable, no matter who took it or where it is filed.

Rule 4003.4. Scope of Discovery. Trial Preparation Material. Statements.
Upon written request, a party is entitled to immediate receipt of a photostatic
copy or like reproduction of a statement concerning the action or its subject matter previously made by that party, any other party or a witness. Upon written
request, a person not a party is entitled to immediate receipt of a photostatic copy
or like reproduction of a statement concerning the action or its subject matter
previously made by that person. If the statement is not so provided, the party or
person may move for a court order. For purposes of this rule, a statement previously made is
(1) a written statement signed or otherwise adopted or approved by the
person making it, or
231 Rule 4003.4 GENERAL
4000-10
(255392) No. 296 Jul. 99 Copyright  1999 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
(2) a stenographic, mechanical, electrical or other recording, or a transcription thereof, which is a substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement by
the person making it and contemporaneously recorded.
Explanatory Note
Rule 4003.4 resolves a problem not covered in the prior practice, and which has troubled the
courts. It provides that any party may, upon request, obtain from his opponent a copy of the party’s
own statement or the statement of any witness in the possession of the opponent. Further, any witness
may obtain a copy of his own statement upon request. If refused, the party or witness may move for
a court order for compliance.
The Rule differs markedly in scope from Fed. R.Civ.P. 26(b)(3). The Federal Rule permits a party
to obtain only his own statement; the production of statements of witnesses obtained by an adverse
party in anticipation of litigation or preparation for trial requires a showing of substantial need in the
preparation of the inquiring party’s case and that he is unable without undue hardship to obtain a substantial equivalent of the materials by other means.
There are no restrictions on the timing of the request. Under prior practice, some lower courts ruled
that the statement of a party given to his opponent could be withheld until after the party had testified. Others held that the party could demand a copy of his statement before he testified. Some held
that no witness could have a copy of his own statement because this would prevent a test of his
veracity.
The amended Rule does not deal with the substantive problem of admissibility in evidence or use
of the statements. Their admissibility is governed by the rules of evidence.
Two statutes are relevant. Section 7101 of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. § 7101, prohibits the use
of statements obtained from an injured person within fifteen days of admission to a hospital or sanitarium, unless he acknowledges before an independent notary public his willingness to give the statement.
Likewise, the Peer Review Protection Act of 1974, 63 P. S. § 425.1 et seq., imposes restrictions on
discovery and use of the proceedings and records of health care peer review organizations for the purpose of evaluating the quality of health care.
The Rule covers all forms of statements, including signed statements, recordings and transcriptions.

expects to call as an expert witness at trial and to state the subject matter on
which the expert is expected to testify and
DEPOSITIONS AND DISCOVERY 231 Rule 4003.5

(B) subject to the provisions of subdivision (a)(4), the other party to
have each expert so identified state the substance of the facts and opinions to
which the expert is expected to testify and a summary of the grounds for
each opinion. The party answering the interrogatories may file as his or her
answer a report of the expert or have the interrogatories answered by the
expert. The answer or separate report shall be signed by the expert.
(2) Upon cause shown, the court may order further discovery by other
means, subject to
(A) such restrictions as to scope and such provisions concerning fees
and expenses as the court may deem appropriate, and
(B) the provisions of subdivision (a)(4) of this rule.
(3) A party may not discover facts known or opinions held by an expert
who has been retained or specially employed by another party in anticipation
of litigation or preparation for trial and who is not expected to be called as a
witness at trial, except a medical expert as provided in Rule 4010(b) or except
on order of court as to any other expert upon a showing of exceptional circumstances under which it is impracticable for the party seeking discovery to obtain
facts or opinions on the same subject by other means, subject to such restrictions as to scope and such provisions concerning fees and expenses as the court
may deem appropriate.
Official Note: For additional provisions governing the production of expert reports in medical professional liability actions, see Rule 1042.26 et seq. Nothing in Rule 1042.26 et seq. precludes the entry of a court order under this rule.
(4) A party may not discover the communications between another party’s
attorney and any expert who is to be identified pursuant to subdivision
(a)(1)(A) or from whom discovery is permitted under subdivision (a)(3) regardless of the form of the communications, except in circumstances that would
warrant the disclosure of privileged communications under Pennsylvania law.
This provision protects from discovery draft expert reports and any communications between another party’s attorney and experts relating to such drafts.
(b) An expert witness whose identity is not disclosed in compliance with
subdivision (a)(1) of this rule shall not be permitted to testify on behalf of the
defaulting party at the trial of the action. However, if the failure to disclose the
identity of the witness is the result of extenuating circumstances beyond the control of the defaulting party, the court may grant a continuance or other appropriate relief.
(c) To the extent that the facts known or opinions held by an expert have
been developed in discovery proceedings under subdivision (a)(1) or (2) of this
rule, the direct testimony of the expert at the trial may not be inconsistent with or
go beyond the fair scope of his or her testimony in the discovery proceedings as
set forth in the deposition, answer to an interrogatory, separate report or supplement thereto. However, the expert shall not be prevented from testifying as to
facts or opinions on matters on which the expert has not been interrogated in the
discovery proceedings.
Explanatory Note
Rule 4011(f), which had protected a deponent, whether or not a party, from giving an opinion as
an expert witness over his objection, has been rescinded. Discovery of these matters is now permitted
by Rule 4003.5, which closely parallels Fed. R.Civ.P. 26(b)(4).
231 Rule 4003.5 GENERAL
4000-12
(373038) No. 479 Oct. 14 Copyright  2014 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
The Rule distinguishes carefully between an expert expected to be called as a witness and an expert
not expected to be called.
With respect to the expert expected to be called, discovery of facts known and opinions held by
him, acquired or developed in anticipation of litigation or for trial, may be obtained as follows:
(1) First, the inquirer can by interrogatories require his opponent to disclose the identity of expert
witnesses he expects to call at trial. The opponent must not only identify such experts but also state
the subject matter on which each is expected to testify.
If a party, in his answer to interrogatories, states that he has not yet retained his experts, he is under
a duty to supplement his answer as provided by Rule 4007.4(1). In addition, the inquirer may obtain
a stipulation that the party will supplement his response or ask the court for an order under Rule
4007.4(3) requiring the party to file a supplemental response when such experts are retained.
(2) In addition, the inquirer can require each expert to be called at the trial whose identity is disclosed to state the substance of the facts and opinion to which he will testify, and a summary of the
grounds for his opinion. The answering party has the option of having the expert answer the interrogatories himself on this issue or prepare a separate report which the answering party may attach to
his answers. The answer or separate report must be signed by the expert.
(3) If the answering party or the expert does not fully comply with the foregoing, the court under
subdivision (b) or (c) may exclude or limit the testimony of such expert if offered at the trial. Sanction Rule 4019(i) also provides an independent sanction, excluding the testimony of a witness whose
identity has not been revealed, unless the trial court determines there are extenuating circumstances
beyond the control of the defaulting party.
(4) Supplemental oral questioning of the expert may be permitted only upon cause shown, and
upon payment of such fees and expenses as the court may fix. The Rule specifically provides no fees
and expenses to the expert for the time spent in preparing answers to interrogatories or his report. He
will be entitled to fees and expenses only if the inquirer seeks further oral discovery after the answer
or report has been filed.
(5) It should be emphasized that Rule 4003.5 is not applicable to discovery and deposition procedure where a defendant is himself an expert, such as a physician, architect or other professional person, and the alleged improper exercise of his professional skills is involved in the action. Such a
defendant can be examined by written interrogatories under Rule 4005 or by oral deposition under
Rule 4007.1. If so examined, a defendant cannot assert that his opinion may not be discovered without his consent.
(6) To prevent incomplete or ‘‘fudging’’ of reports which would fail to reveal fully the facts and
opinions of the expert or his grounds therefor, subdivision (c) provides that an expert’s direct testimony at the trial may not be inconsistent with or go beyond the fair scope of his testimony as set
forth in his deposition and answer to interrogatories, separate report or supplements thereto. However,
he may testify to anything regarding matters in which he was never questioned in the discovery proceedings. This is a new provision not expressly found in the Federal Rule. It is implicit in the Federal
Rule.
Where the full scope of the expert’s testimony is presented in the answer to interrogatories or the
separate report, as provided in subdivisions (a)(1) and (2), this will fix the permissible limits of his
testimony at the trial. But, if the inquirer limits his inquiry to one or more specific issues only, the
expert is free to testify at trial as to any other relevant issues not included in the discovery. Therefore,
what happens at the trial may depend upon the manner in which the expert is interrogated. The
inquirer may be well advised to conduct his discovery broadly, by paraphrasing the language of
4003.5(a), which will require the expert to state all his opinions and grounds, thus preventing surprise
testimony at trial concerning grounds never raised during the discovery.
All of the foregoing discussion relates to the expert expected to be called at the trial.
If the expert is not expected to be called at the trial, the situation is quite different. The special
procedures listed above will not be applicable. Under subdivision (a)(3) of the Rule, no discovery of
such a witness is permitted, except discovery of a medical expert under Rule 4010(b) infra, unless
there is an order of court. To obtain this order of court, the inquirer must prove ‘‘exceptional circumstances’’ under which there is no practical way to find the facts or opinions by some other means.
Therefore, even if the inquirer knows the name of this expert, or knows that there is a report, he
is forbidden to seek discovery of facts known or opinions held, unless he convinces the court that he
must have the discovery. This is a heavy burden, which explains the small use of this provision under
the Federal Rule. We can anticipate an equally small use in Pennsylvania.

testing and is destroyed in the testing. Then, if the defendant elects not to call that expert at the trial,
the plaintiff must get his testimony since the object is destroyed.
The Rule provides no special procedures in this instance. It is anticipated that ordinary discovery
will suffice. If the inquirer does not know the name of the expert, he can ask for it by conventional
interrogatory or oral deposition. If he knows there is a report, he can ask for it under Rule 4009.
Another difference is that the court may require the inquirer to pay the expert for his fees and
expenses in the discovery. In the case of the expert who is expected to be called at the trial, there is
no such provision in subsections (a)(1) and (2).
The Rule says nothing about the rare situation when the inquirer is an indigent party and cannot
pay the expenses of the expert. Any such situation will have to be handled by the courts ad hoc, under
the general principles of litigation in forma pauperis.
This subdivision is not intended, as pointed out by the federal draftsmen, to permit discovery of
experts who may have been informally consulted by a party. Finally, it applies only to experts
‘‘retained or specially employed.’’ A regular employe of a party who may have collected facts, prepared reports and rendered opinions, and who may be qualified as an expert, is not covered by this
sub-section and has no immunity from discovery, simply because the party elects not to call him at
the trial. He is not an ‘‘expert’’ within the meaning of the Rule; he is simply a witness, an employe
of a party.

the time and place of taking the deposition and the name and address of each
person to be examined if known, and, if the name is not known, a general
description sufficient to identify each person to be examined or the particular

the notice, or that it not be taken except upon oral examination.
DEPOSITIONS AND DISCOVERY 231 Rule 4003.8.
4000-15
(333803) No. 403 Jun. 08
Explanatory Note
The amendments make two major changes in the prior practice. First, in subdivision (a) the time
period for filing cross-interrogatories is extended from ten days to thirty days and the time period for
filing redirect interrogatories is extended from five days to ten days. These time periods follow the
Federal Rules. In subdivision (b) the time period for filing objections to the form of interrogatories is
extended from five days to ten days.
Second, subdivision (a) is further amended by adding a new subparagraph (2) providing for a
notice identifying the officer, the time and place, and the name and address of each witness. If a name
is unknown, it is sufficient to identify the witness or the particular class or group to which he belongs.
This was previously permitted only as to notice of oral depositions under Rule 4007(c) and written
interrogatories to a party under Rule 4005(a). It was not permitted as to written interrogatories to a
witness under Rule 4004.
This new subparagraph (2) also incorporates by reference the provisions of new Rule 4007.1(e).
This follows Fed. R.Civ.P. 30(b)(6) and 31(a) and permits a party to name a corporation, partnership,
association, or governmental agency as the deponent and to designate the matter on which the opponent requests examination. The organization is then required to name one or more of its officers,
directors, or managing agents, or other person who consents to appear as the person to be examined.
If a person who has knowledge of the facts is not an officer, director or managing agent but is an
employe and he refuses his consent, discovery may be used to ascertain his identity and he may
thereafter be subpoenaed to appear.
As stated by the draftsmen of the amendments to the Federal Rules, these provisions reduce the
difficulties previously encountered in determining, prior to the submission of written interrogatories
or the taking of a deposition, the identity of the proper person to testify. The provision will avoid the
necessity of deposing large numbers of officers, directors, agents or others, only to find in turn that
they have no knowledge, or incomplete knowledge, of the information sought.
Present subdivisions (c), (d) and (e) of this Rule remain unchanged.

Rule 4005. Written Interrogatories to a Party.
(a) Subject to the limitations provided by Rule 4011, any party may serve
upon any other party written interrogatories to be answered by the party served
or, if the party served is a public or private corporation or similar entity or a partnership or association, by any officer or agent, who shall furnish such information as is available to the party. Interrogatories may be served upon any party at
the time of service of the original process or at any time thereafter. Interrogatories which are to be served prior to service of the complaint shall be limited to
the purpose of preparing a complaint and shall contain a brief statement of the
nature of the cause of action. Interrogatories shall be prepared in such fashion that
sufficient space is provided immediately after each interrogatory or subsection
thereof for insertion of the answer or objection.
Official Note: Rule 440 requires the party serving interrogatories upon any other party to
serve a copy upon every party to the action.
Interrogatories that generally require the responding party to state the basis of particular
claims, defenses or contentions made in pleadings or other documents should be used sparingly
and, if used, should be designed to target claims, defenses or contentions that the propounding
attorney reasonably suspects may be the proper subjects of early dismissal or resolution or,
alternatively, to identify and to narrow the scope of claims, defenses and contentions made
where the scope is unclear.

(b) Rescinded.
Official Note: The subject matter governed by former Rule 4005(b) has been transferred to
Rule 4006(a).
(c) Interrogatories may relate to any matters which can be inquired into under
Rules 4003.1 through 4003.5 inclusive and the answers may be used to the same
extent as provided in Rule 4020 for the use of the deposition of a party. Interrogatories may be served after a deposition has been taken, and a deposition may
be taken after interrogatories have been answered, but the court, on motion of the
party interrogated, may make such protective order as justice requires. The number of interrogatories or of sets of interrogatories to be served may be limited as
justice requires to protect the party from unreasonable annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, burden or expense.
Explanatory Note
The amendments to Rule 4005 make a number of stylistic changes, and three important changes of
substance.
First, the word ‘‘adverse’’ has been deleted to permit interrogatories to be addressed to any other
party to the action, whether or not adverse to the inquiring party. This is the same change which was
made in Fed. R. Civ.P. 33 in 1970. The amendment clarifies the right to file interrogatories to additional defendants or co-defendants. Some lower court decisions held that additional defendants were
not adverse parties and that interrogatories must be addressed to them as witnesses. Similarly, an
additional defendant could not be compelled to respond to requests for admission under Rule 4014
since that likewise was restricted to adverse parties.
In a marked departure from the prior practice, amended Rules 4005 and 4006 require that the
interrogatories and the answers thereto be contained in one document, with the answer immediately
following the interrogatory to which it is responsive. Rule 4005 requires the inquiring party to leave
sufficient space after each interrogatory for insertion of the answer. The original and two copies are
served upon the answering party. The original is not filed until the answers have been inserted and
the document signed and verified as provided by Rule 4006. It is recognized that in some cases it will
be difficult to estimate the amount of space required for an answer. Rule 4006 provides that the
answering party may continue his answer to an individual interrogatory on a supplemental sheet,
identifying the number of the interrogatory to which it is responsive. Of course, the answering party
may desire, as a matter of style, to retype the page rather than attach a supplemental sheet.
The time restriction in the former Rule, requiring leave of court if the interrogatories are to be
served within 20 days of the commencement of the action, has been eliminated. Interrogatories may
be filed with the complaint or writ or at any time thereafter.
Finally, the last sentence of subdivision (c), which does not appear in Fed. R. Civ.P. 33(b), permits
the court to order a limitation upon the number of interrogatories or sets of interrogatories as justice
requires to protect a party from unreasonable annoyance, expense, embarrassment or oppression. It is
adapted from prior Rule 4005(c). Suggestions that the Rule specifically fix the number of interrogatories which can be submitted without leave of court was considered and rejected in favor of a more
flexible limitation.
Explanatory Note—2008
Civil Discovery Standard No. 8 of the American Bar Association (2004) establishes a guideline for
the use of contention interrogatories. This standard has been added as a note to Rule 4003.1(c) governing discovery of opinions and contentions and as the second paragraph to the present note to Rule
4005(a) governing written interrogatories to a party.
The rationale for the proposal is succinctly set forth in the Comment to Civil Discovery Standard
No. 8:
* * * Contention interrogatories, like all forms of discovery, can be susceptible to abuse. Among
other things, they can be used as an attempt to tie up the opposing party rather than to obtain discovery. The legitimate purpose of contention interrogatories is to narrow the issues for trial, not to force
the opposing side to marshal all its evidence on paper.***
The potential for overreaching is particularly present when interrogatories seeking the detailed
underpinnings of the opposing party’s allegations are served early in the case. Although, when used
with discretion, interrogatories served near the outset of the case can be useful in narrowing the issues
to define the scope of necessary discovery, contention interrogatories ordinarily are more appropriate
DEPOSITIONS AND DISCOVERY 231 Rule 4005
4000-17
(333805) No. 403 Jun. 08
after the bulk of discovery has already taken place. At that point, the party on whom the interrogatories are served should have the information necessary to give specific, useful responses. [Citations

Rule 4006. Answers to Written Interrogatories by a Party.
(a)(1) Answers to interrogatories shall be in writing and verified. The answers
shall be inserted in the spaces provided in the interrogatories. If there is insufficient space to answer an interrogatory, the remainder of the answer shall follow
on a supplemental sheet.
(2) Each interrogatory shall be answered fully and completely unless
objected to, in which event the reasons for the objection shall be stated in lieu
of an answer. The answers shall be signed by the person making them, and the
objections shall be signed by the attorney making them. The statement of an
objection shall not excuse the answering party from answering all remaining
interrogatories to which no objection is stated. The answering party shall serve
a copy of the answers, and objections if any, within thirty days after the service of the interrogatories. The party submitting the interrogatories may move
the court to dismiss an objection and direct that the interrogatory be answered.
Official Note: Rule 440 requires the answering party to serve a copy of the answers upon
every party to the action.
(3) [Rescinded].
Official Note: See Rule 4003.1 for the general scope of discovery.
(b) Where the answer to an interrogatory may be derived or ascertained from
the records of the party upon whom the interrogatory has been served or from an
examination, audit or inspection of that party’s records, or from a compilation,
abstract or summary based thereon, and the burden of deriving or ascertaining the
answer would be substantially the same for the party serving the interrogatory as
for the party served, a sufficient answer to such an interrogatory shall be to
specify the records from which the answer may be derived or ascertained and to
afford the party serving the interrogatory reasonable opportunity to examine,
audit or inspect those records and to obtain copies, compilations, abstracts or
summaries.
Explanatory Note
The prior Rule has been completely rewritten to incorporate substantial parts of Fed. R. Civ.P. 33
and to conform to Rule 4005.
(1) The restriction in the prior Rule to ‘‘adverse’’ parties is deleted.
(2) The answering party will respond to each interrogatory in the space provided. If the space is
inadequate, he may retype the interrogatories or he may use a supplemental sheet for the remainder
of his response.
(3) The amendment requires the answering person to sign the answer and the attorney to sign any
objections. This follows Fed. R. Civ.P. 33. Present practice provides only for signing the answer.
(4) An interrogatory which is otherwise proper is not objectionable because the answer will
require an opinion or the application of law to fact. This conforms to Fed. R. Civ.P. 33(b) and the
rescission of former Rule 4011(f).
231 Rule 4006 GENERAL
4000-18
(333806) No. 403 Jun. 08 Copyright  2008 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
(5) Subdivision (b) copies Fed. R. Civ.P. 33(c) by providing that, where the requested information may be derived or ascertained from a party’s records, he has an option to produce the records for
inspection by the inquiring party rather than detailing the information in his answer.
The amendment, however, goes beyond Fed. R. Civ.P. 33(c) by making the option applicable to all
records. The Federal Rule restricts the option to ‘‘business’’ records. This expansion of the option to
all records is not intended to give an answering party carte blanche to foist upon the inquiring party
a jumble of personal records. The option can be used only where the burden would be substantially
the same for both parties and never where it will be an undue burden on the inquiring party. The
amendment also goes beyond the Federal Rule in requiring the inquiring party who has made compilations, abstracts or summaries from the records to furnish a copy to the party who has produced the
records. This will help facilitate agreements as to their accuracy for use at trial and prevent surprise.
(6) The time periods for answer are extended to 30 days after service of the interrogatories to
conform to the time period of the Federal Rule.
(7) Under the amendment, as under the Federal Rule, the statement of an objection will not
excuse the answering party from answering all remaining interrogatories to which no objection is
stated.

Rule 4007.1. Procedure in Deposition by Oral Examination.
(a) General Rule. A party desiring to take the deposition of any person upon
oral examination shall give reasonable notice in writing to every other party to
the action, except that no notice need be given a defendant who was served by
publication and has not appeared in the action. A party noticed to be deposed
shall be required to appear without subpoena.
(b) General Notice Requirements. The notice shall:

4007.2(b) and (c), if appropriate;
(2) state the time and place of taking the deposition; and
(3) state the name and address of each person to be examined if known, or,
if the name is not known, a general description sufficient to identify the deponent or the particular class or group to which the deponent belongs.
(c) Notice Requirements for Deposition in Pre-Complaint Discovery. The purpose of the deposition and matters to be inquired into need not be stated in the
notice unless the action has been commenced by writ of summons and the plaintiff desires to take the deposition of any person upon oral examination for the
DEPOSITIONS AND DISCOVERY 231 Rule 4007

purpose of preparing a complaint. In such case, the notice shall include a brief
statement of the nature of the cause of action and of the matters to be inquired
into.
(d) Additional Notice Requirements on Party or Witness.
(1) If the person to be examined is a party, the notice may include a request
made in compliance with Rule 4009.1 et seq., for the production of documents
and tangible things at the taking of the deposition.
(2) If the person to be examined is not a party, and is to be served with a
subpoena duces tecum to produce designated materials, the notice shall specify
the materials to be produced. The materials shall be produced at the deposition
and not earlier, except upon the consent of all parties to the action.
(e) Notice to Public or Private Corporations, Partnerships, Associations, or
Governmental Agencies.
(1) In the notice or an issued subpoena, a party may:
(i) name as the deponent a public or private corporation, a partnership,
an association, or a governmental agency; and
(ii) describe with reasonable particularity the matters to be inquired into
and the materials to be produced.
(2) Any organization named pursuant to subdivision (e)(1)(i):
(i) shall serve a designation of one or more officers, directors, managing agents, or other persons who consent to testify on its behalf; and
(ii) may set forth for each designated person the matters on which each
person will testify.
(3) A subpoena shall advise a non-party organization of its duty to make
such a designation. The designated person or persons shall testify as to matters
known or reasonably available to the organization.
(4) Subdivision (e) does not preclude taking a deposition by any other procedure authorized in these rules.

Historical Commentary
The following commentary is historical in nature and represents statements of the Committee at the
time of rulemaking:
Explanatory Comment—1978
Former Rule 4007 has been rescinded. The subject matter of former subdivision (a), dealing with
the scope of discovery, has been enlarged and transposed to Rule 4003.1, supra. The provisions of
former subdivision (b), dealing with the requirement of leave of court, have been transposed to Rule
4007.2. The provisions of former subdivision (c), dealing with notice, are enlarged in Rule 4007.1.
The provisions of former subdivision (d)(1), authorizing local option rules for the content of the
notice, are deleted and all local rules under former subdivision (d) will be invalid. The provisions of
former subdivision (d)(2) for the filing of objections are deleted. A protective order under Rule 4012
is available.
231 Rule 4007.1 GENERAL
4000-20
(422098) No. 605 Apr. 25 Copyright  2025 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
In place of former Rule 4007 are new Rule 4007.1, which prescribes the procedure in deposition
by oral examination, Rule 4007.2, which prescribes when leave of court is required, and Rules 4007.3
and 4007.4, which govern the sequence and timing of discovery and supplementary responses, subjects not previously governed by the Rules. These new Rules will be commented on separately.
Subdivisions (a) and (b) repeat the substance of former Rule 4007(c). A provision has been added
to make it clear that a party noticed to be deposed need not be subpoenaed. The notice is sufficient
to support subsequent sanction procedures under Rule 4019 for failure to appear.
Subdivision (c) is new. It provides that the purpose of the deposition and the matters to be inquired
into need not be stated in the notice, except in the relatively infrequent case where the action has been
commenced by a writ of summons and the plaintiff desires to take a deposition upon oral examination for the purpose of preparing a complaint. In this situation the inquirer must provide a brief statement of the nature of the cause of action and of the matters to be inquired into. The reason for the
Rule is obvious. The party who has not yet been served with a complaint may in some instances not
be aware of the nature of the action and thus be totally unprepared to submit to oral examination.
Subdivision (d) clarifies the practice for the production of documents in connection with an oral
deposition. Under it, a simple request to a party to produce documents is sufficient. No subpoena is
needed. But if the person examined is a witness and not a party, a subpoena duces tecum to produce
specified materials and documents must be served.
Subdivision (e) is adapted, almost verbatim, from Fed.R.Civ.P. 30(b)(6). It provides, as an optional
alternative to other forms of discovery, that the notice may name as a deponent a public or private
corporation or a partnership or association or governmental agency. In this situation, however, the
notice must describe with reasonable particularity the matters to be inquired into and the materials to
be produced. The organization, if it is a party, is then required to serve on the inquirer a designation
of the officers, directors, managing agents or other persons who will testify on its behalf. The purpose
of the Rule is to avoid the wholesale subpoenaing of named directors, officers, and others where the
inquirer does not know the identity of the exact person or persons who will be able to testify as to the
requested information.
If it develops that the designated persons reveal others whose testimony may be relevant, they can
also be deposed. The procedure is not exclusive and the inquirer may resort to any other method of
discovery and subpoena available.
The reference to the ‘‘consent to testify’’ is limited to persons other than officers, directors or managing agents. The latter may not frustrate the discovery by declining to testify; their position requires
them to testify. A subordinate employe is not in the same position and the organization cannot designate such a subordinate employe unless it certifies that he will testify.
Explanatory Comment—1998
Section 5326 of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. § 5326, relating to ‘‘Assistance to tribunals and litigants outside this Commonwealth with respect to depositions’’ provides:
(a) General Rule.—A court of record of this Commonwealth may order a person who is
domiciled or is found within this Commonwealth to give his testimony or statement or to produce documents or other things for use in a matter pending in a tribunal outside this Commonwealth....
New subdivision (f) of Rule 4007.1 responds to the concern that there should be a limitation upon
the county from which an order may be sought so that the person who is the subject of the order is
not put to unreasonable expense or burden. A resident of Erie should not have to travel to Easton to
object to an order obtained in connection with litigation outside the Commonwealth.

outside the Commonwealth or a place more than one hundred miles from the
courthouse in which the action is pending.
(c) If the plaintiff proceeds under subdivision (b)(1) or (2) of this rule the
notice of taking the deposition shall set forth the facts which support taking it
without leave of court. The plaintiff’s attorney shall sign the notice and this signature shall constitute a certification that to the best of the attorney’s knowledge,
information and belief the statement of facts is true.
Official Note: The court upon cause shown may make a protective order with respect to
the time and place of taking the deposition. See Rule 4012.
(d) The deposition of a person confined in prison may be taken only by leave
of court on such terms as the court prescribes.
Explanatory Note
This Rule consolidates in one Rule various provisions for leave of court which are now scattered
through the prior Rules. It substantially follows present practice.
Rule 4003.5(a)(2), incorporated by reference, requires leave of court for further examination of
experts whose opinions or reports have already been disclosed in response to the interrogatories.
Leave of court will also be required, under subdivision (d), to take the deposition of a person confined in prison. This follows the practice under prior Rule 4007(b).
Subdivision (b) states a general rule that leave of court is required where a plaintiff seeks to take
an oral deposition prior to the expiration of 30 days after service of original process, if the defendant
has not within such period sought discovery or noticed a deposition of his own. This is adapted from
prior Rule 4007(b) with an extension of the time from 20 to 30 days.
However, subdivision (b) contains a special exception for aged, infirm or going witnesses. This was
not in prior Rule 4007. No leave of court is required if the plaintiff’s notice to take the deposition
sets forth the facts respecting the witness and the notice is signed by the plaintiff’s attorney. This constitutes a certification by him that the statement is true to the best of his knowledge, information and
belief. The court, however, upon cause shown may under Rule 4012, on motion of an objecting party,
enter a protective order changing the time or place.
Explanatory Note—1999
Rule 4007.2(a) has been amended to delete the reference to Rule 4001(a). Rule 4001(a) was
amended in 1997 by the deletion of the reference to domestic relations actions, the rules of which formerly contained a broad prohibition against discovery except upon leave of court. That broad prohibition has now been narrowed and discovery is available to the extent provided by Rule 1930.5 governing discovery in domestic relations matters generally and Rules 1910.9 and 1915.5 governing
discovery in the actions of support and custody, respectively. At the same time, those rules continue
to require leave of court in specified instances.

Rule 4007.3. Sequence and Timing of Discovery.
Unless the court upon motion, for the convenience of parties and witnesses and
in the interests of justice, orders otherwise, methods of discovery may be used in
any sequence and the fact that a party is conducting discovery, whether by deposition or otherwise, shall not operate to delay any other party’s discovery.
Explanatory Note
Neither the Federal Rules, prior to their amendment in 1970, nor prior Rule 4007 dealt with this
subject. Some courts held that a party who first gave notice obtained a priority which would prevent
depositions or discovery by other parties until the first party had completed his own depositions and
discovery. This led to a ‘‘race to the courthouse.’’ The proposed Rule, which is taken almost verbatim
from Fed. R.Civ.P. 26(d), is designed to reverse these decisions.
In principle, a party first initiating discovery gets no priority whatever. Nothing prevents other parties from proceeding simultaneously with their discovery.
Further, all methods of discovery may be used in any sequence; for example, interrogatories may
precede oral depositions, or oral depositions may be followed by interrogatories or requests for
admissions or requests for production of documents.
All this, however, is subject to the control of the court, which may enter special orders ‘‘for the
convenience of parties and witnesses and in the interest of justice.’’

Rule 4007.4. Supplementing Responses.
A party or an expert witness who has responded to a request for discovery with
a response that was complete when made is under no duty to supplement the
response to include information thereafter acquired, except as follows:
(1) A party is under a duty seasonably to supplement the response with
respect to any question directly addressed to the identity and location of persons having knowledge of discoverable matters and the identity of each person
expected to be called as an expert witness at trial, the subject matter on which
each person is expected to testify and the substance of each person’s testimony
as provided in Rule 4003.5(a)(1).
(2) A party or an expert witness is under a duty seasonably to amend a
prior response if he or she obtains information upon the basis of which he or
she knows
(i) the response was incorrect when made, or
(ii) the response though correct when made is no longer true.
DEPOSITIONS AND DISCOVERY 231 Rule 4007.3
4000-23
(295867) No. 341 Apr. 03
(3) A duty to supplement responses may be imposed by order of the court,
agreement of the parties, or at any time prior to trial through new requests to
supplement prior responses.
Explanatory Note
The prior Rules contained no provisions imposing any continuing obligation on an answering party
to supplement his responses to interrogatories or oral depositions if he becomes aware of subsequent
facts which make his prior answers incorrect when made or no longer true in the light of new circumstances.
Rule 4007.4 is adapted from Fed. R.Civ.P. 26(e) to provide such an automatic obligation. The automatic obligation is limited to (a) disclosure by a party of the identity and location of additional persons having knowledge of discoverable facts and the identity of persons expected to be called at trial
as expert witnesses, and (b) amendment of a prior answer if a party or expert witness obtains information on the basis of which he knows that the original response was incorrect, or, if correct when
originally made, is no longer true. Additional obligations to supplement may be imposed by (1) an
order of court; or (2) an agreement of the parties; or (3) supplemental interrogatories.
Fed. R.Civ.P. 26(e) has not been adopted verbatim. It restricts the duty to cases where ‘‘the circumstances are such that a failure to amend the response is in substance a knowing concealment.’’ This
limitation has been rejected. It would introduce collateral issues. The test in new Rule 4007.4 is
whether the party or the expert witness knows that the response was incorrect or is no longer correct
in the light of intervening events of which he has knowledge. If he knows this, he must correct the
response. If he does not know it, he need do nothing. Whether a failure to correct it is a ‘‘knowing
concealment’’ introduces a different issue.
The Rule operates in several different ways as a practical matter.
First, it is quite common, when an oral deposition is complete, for the inquirer to request, and
obtain, an agreement from the opponent or from an expert witness to supplement the response within
the scope of the Rule. This also can be accomplished by appropriate closing questions in interrogatories.
Second, the inquirer, if such an agreement is refused, may move the court to enter an appropriate
order.
Third, the inquirer may, at any time, force a review of prior responses by filing supplementary
interrogatories or noticing a supplementary oral examination to discover whether the respondent has
become aware of any information which requires an amendment of any prior response.
The Rule also expands the Federal Rule by including ‘‘a party or an expert witness’’; the Federal
Rule includes ‘‘a party’’ only.

Explanatory Note
This Rule remains unchanged.
It applies only where a deposition is to be taken by oral examination more than 100 miles from the
courthouse. It does not apply to other situations or to other forms of discovery. Other kinds of limitations are prescribed in Rule 4012, infra, which provides for protective orders in all forms of discovery, in Rule 4010(a) which provides for limitations of physical or mental examinations and Rule
4009(b)(2) which provides for objections to production of documents and things and entry for inspection.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
Explanatory Comment—Electronically Stored Information
A. No Importation of Federal Law
Though the term ‘‘electronically stored information’’ is used in these rules, there is no intent to
incorporate the federal jurisprudence surrounding the discovery of electronically stored information.
The treatment of such issues is to be determined by traditional principles of proportionality under
Pennsylvania law as discussed in further detail below.
B. Proportionality Standard
As with all other discovery, electronically stored information is governed by a proportionality standard in order that discovery obligations are consistent with the just, speedy and inexpensive determination and resolution of litigation disputes. The proportionality standard requires the court, within the
framework of the purpose of discovery of giving each party the opportunity to prepare its case, to
consider: (i) the nature and scope of the litigation, including the importance and complexity of the
issues and the amounts at stake; (ii) the relevance of electronically stored information and its importance to the court’s adjudication in the given case; (iii) the cost, burden, and delay that may be
imposed on the parties to deal with electronically stored information; (iv) the ease of producing electronically stored information and whether substantially similar information is available with less burden; and (v) any other factors relevant under the circumstances.
C. Tools for Addressing Electronically Stored Information
Parties and courts may consider tools such as electronic searching, sampling, cost sharing, and
non-waiver agreements to fairly allocate discovery burdens and costs. When utilizing non-waiver
agreements, parties may wish to incorporate those agreements into court orders to maximize protection vis-à-vis third parties. See, e.g., Fed. R. Evid. 502(c).

(361797) No. 454 Sep. 12
D. Eliminating References to ‘‘Depositions’’
The elimination of specific references to ‘‘depositions’’ in Rule 4011 is not intended to exclude
depositions from the scope of this rule. The reference was eliminated because there was no reason to
call out this one form of traditional discovery among many.
Rule 4009.1. Production of Documents and Things. General Provisions.
(a) Any party may serve a request upon a party pursuant to Rules 4009.11
and 4009.12 or a subpoena upon a person not a party pursuant to Rules 4009.21
through 4009.27 to produce and permit the requesting party, or someone acting
on the party’s behalf, to inspect and copy any designated documents (including
writings, drawings, graphs, charts, photographs, and electronically stored information), or to inspect, copy, test or sample any tangible things or electronically
stored information, which constitute or contain matters within the scope of Rules
4003.1 through 4003.6 inclusive and which are in the possession, custody or control of the party or person upon whom the request or subpoena is served, and may
do so one or more times.
(b) A party requesting electronically stored information may specify the format in which it is to be produced and a responding party or person not a party
may object. If no format is specified by the requesting party, electronically stored
information may be produced in the form in which it is ordinarily maintained or
in a reasonably usable form.
Official Note: These rules do not prevent a court from entering an order under its common
law power preserving or protecting a document or thing.
Parties to an action and persons not parties but served with a subpoena or request pursuant to
these rules have the protective and enforcement provisions of the discovery rules available to
them. See Rule 4012 governing protective orders and Rule 4019 governing enforcement and
sanctions for failure to make discovery.
The remedy of a protective order is available to the party to whom a request is directed to
prevent abuse.
These rules do not preclude (1) the issuance under Rule 234.1 et seq. of a subpoena or
request for the production of documents or things at a deposition pursuant to Rule 4007.1(d) or
(2) an independent action against a person not a party for production of documents or things.
For additional provisions governing the production of expert reports in medical professional
liability actions, see Rule 1042.26 et seq.

commencement of the action and upon any other party with or after service of the
original process upon that party.
(b) The request shall set forth in numbered paragraphs the items to be produced either by individual item or by category, and describe each item or category with reasonable particularity. Each paragraph shall seek only a single item

Rule 4009.12. Answer to Request Upon a Party for Production of
Documents and Things.
(a) The party upon whom the request is served shall within thirty days after
the service of the request
(1) serve an answer including objections to each numbered paragraph in
the request, and
(2) produce or make available to the party submitting the request those
documents and things described in the request to which there is no objection.
(i) Where the documents may be identified only after review of a larger
group of documents, and the burden of identifying the documents would be
substantially the same for the party serving the request as for the party
served, the party served may afford the party serving the request reasonable
opportunity to identify the documents, to examine or inspect them and to
obtain copies.
(b) The answer shall be in the form of a paragraph-by-paragraph response
which shall
(1) identify all documents or things produced or made available;
(2) identify all documents or things not produced or made available
because of the objection that they are not within the scope of permissible discovery under Rule 4003.2 through Rule 4003.6 inclusive and Rule 4011(c).
Documents or things not produced shall be identified with reasonable particularity together with the basis for non-production;
(3) specify a larger group of documents or things from which the documents or things to be produced or made available may be identified as provided
by subdivision (a)(2)(i);
(4) object to the request on the grounds set forth in Rule 4011(a), (b), and
(e) or on the ground that the request does not meet the requirements of Rule
4009.11;
(5) state that after reasonable investigation, it has been determined that
there are no documents responsive to the request.
Official Note: The party who is requested to produce documents or things is encouraged to
identify the documents or things produced and the documents or things withheld through a system of numbering. The party producing the documents and things and the party receiving them
DEPOSITIONS AND DISCOVERY 231 Rule 4009.12
4000-27
(361799) No. 454 Sep. 12
are encouraged to keep a current list of the documents and things produced and withheld based
on the numbering system. This procedure will assist the court in resolving disputes arising out
of production of documents.
Ordinarily, each page of a document should receive a separate number. However, a document
may be assigned a number as a whole if it is bound or if it contains pages which are sequentially numbered.
The court may require numbering.
(c) The answer shall be signed and verified by the party making it and signed
also by the attorney making an objection if one is set forth.
(d) If a request if reasonably susceptible to one construction under which
documents sought to be produced are within the scope of the request and another
construction under which the documents are outside the scope of the request, the
answering party shall either produce the documents or identify with reasonable
particularity the documents not produced together with the basis for nonproduction.

Rule 4009.31. Entry Upon Property for Inspection and Other Activities.
General Provisions.
Any party may serve a request upon a party pursuant to Rule 4009.32 or a
motion upon a person not a party pursuant to Rule 4009.33 to permit entry upon
designated property in the possession or control of the party or person upon
whom the request is served for the purpose of inspecting and measuring, surveying, photographing, testing, or sampling the property or any designated object or
operation thereon, within the scope of Rules 4003.1 through 4003.6 inclusive.
Official Note: These rules do not prevent a court from entering an order under its common
law power preserving or protecting property.
Parties to an action and persons not parties but served with a subpoena or request pursuant to

Rule 4010. Physical and Mental Examination of Persons.
(a)(1) As used in this rule, ‘‘examiner’’ means a licensed physician, licensed
dentist or licensed psychologist.
DEPOSITIONS AND DISCOVERY 231 Rule 4010
4000-33
(297599) No. 346 Sep. 03
(2)(a) When the mental or physical condition of a party, or of a person in
the custody or under the legal control of a party, is in controversy, the court in
which the action is pending may order the party to submit to a physical or
mental examination by an examiner or to produce for examination the person
in the party’s custody or legal control.
Official Note: The examination may include blood or genetic testing.
(3) The order may be made only on motion for good cause shown and
upon notice to the person to be examined and to all parties and shall specify
the time, place, manner, conditions and scope of the examination and the person or persons by whom it is to be made.
(4)(i) The person to be examined shall have the right to have counsel or
other representative present during the examination. The examiner’s oral interrogation of the person to be examined shall be limited to matters specifically
relevant to the scope of the examination.
Official Note: Ordinarily, the facts giving rise to liability are not germane to an examination and the information which the examiner seeks should be limited to facts of liability germane
to the issue of damages.
(ii) Subdivision (a)(4)(i) shall not apply to actions for custody, partial
custody and visitation of minor children.
(5)(i) The party who is being examined or who is producing for examination a person in the party’s custody or legal control may have made upon reasonable notice and at the party’s expense a stenographic or audio recording of
the examination. Upon request and payment of reasonable cost, the party who
caused the recording to be made shall provide each other party with a copy of
the recording.
(ii) Subdivision (a)(5)(i) shall not apply to actions for custody, partial
custody and visitation of minor children.
(b)(1) If requested by the party against whom an order is made under this rule
or the person examined, the party causing the examination to be made shall
deliver to the requesting party or person a copy of a detailed written report of the
examiner setting out the examiner’s findings, including results of all tests made,
diagnoses and conclusions, together with like reports of all earlier examinations
of the same condition. After delivery the party causing the examination shall be
entitled upon request to receive from the party against whom the order is made
a like report of any examination, previously or thereafter made, of the same condition, unless, in the case of a report of examination of a person not a party, the
party shows inability to obtain it. The court on motion may make an order against
a party requiring delivery of a report on such terms as are just, and if an examiner fails or refuses to make a report the court shall exclude the examiner’s testimony if offered at the trial.

(297600) No. 346 Sep. 03 Copyright  2003 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
(2) By requesting and obtaining a report of the examination so ordered or
by taking the deposition of the examiner, the party examined waives any privilege the party may have in that action or any other involving the same controversy, regarding the testimony of every other person who has examined or may
thereafter examine the party in respect of the same mental or physical condition.
(3) Subdivision (b) applies to an examination made by agreement of the
parties, unless the agreement expressly provides otherwise. It does not preclude
discovery of a report of an examiner or the taking of a deposition of the examiner in accordance with the provisions of any other rule.
Explanatory Note
Prior Rule 4010 has been substantially revised to conform closely to Fed. R.Civ.P. 35. It makes the
following changes in the prior practice:
(1) The Federal Rule covers a party and also a person in the custody or legal control of a party.
This expansion is incorporated in the amendment.
(2) The amendment introduces a specific requirement of ‘‘good cause shown’’ and notice to all
parties and to the person to be examined. Actually, this makes no change in present practice. Good
cause and notice were implicit in the prior Rule, which required a showing that the physical or mental condition was in controversy in the action. Good cause and notice are intended to protect parties
against undue invasion of their rights to privacy.
(3) Subdivision (b)(1) gives the party against whom the order is issued the right to require the
examining physician to give him a report of the results of all tests made and his diagnoses and conclusions, including like reports of all earlier examinations of the same condition to which the examining physician may have had access. This would include the results of X-rays, cardiograms or other
tests. If such a report is requested and received, the recipient must reciprocate, on request, and deliver
a copy of all prior or later examinations made by his physician. Sanctions are provided for refusal.
This follows Fed. R.Civ.P. 35(b)(1).
(4) Subdivision (b)(2) provides that if a report is requested and received under subdivision (b)(1)
or if the deposition of the examining physician is taken, the party examined waives any privilege he
may have concerning the testimony of anyone who may have examined him earlier or thereafter. This
follows Fed. R.Civ.P. 35(b)(2).
(5) Subdivision (b)(3) provides that examinations made by agreement of the parties may be subject to production under the Rule and that discovery of the report of an examining physician or
deposing him under other Rules is not precluded. This follows Fed. R.Civ.P. 35(b)(3) as amended in
1970.
In practice, medical reports, as part of the special damages, are routinely submitted during settlement discussions, sometimes even before suit is commenced. There was little litigation over prior
Rule 4010 and there should be relatively little under the amended Rule.

Rule 4010.1. Evaluation of Earning Capacity.
(a) When the earning capacity of a party, or of a person in the custody or
under the legal control of a party, is in controversy, the court in which the action
is pending may order the party to submit to an evaluation by a suitably licensed
or certified evaluator or to produce for evaluation the person in the party’s custody or legal control.

Rule 4011. Limitation of Scope of Discovery.
No discovery, including discovery of electronically stored information, shall be
permitted which
(a) is sought in bad faith;
(b) would cause unreasonable annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, burden
or expense to the deponent or any person or party;
(c) is beyond the scope of discovery as set forth in Rules 4003.1 through
4003.6;
(d) is prohibited by any law barring disclosure of mediation communications
and mediation documents; or
Official Note: Section 5949 of the Judicial Code, 43 Pa.C.S. § 5949, provides, with specified exceptions, that all mediation communications and mediation documents are privileged. See
Section 5949(c) for definitions of mediation communication and mediation document.
(e) would require the making of an unreasonable investigation by the deponent or any party or witness.
Official Note: As with all other discovery rules, this rule governs electronically stored
information. See the explanatory comment preceding Rule 4009.1.
Explanatory Note
The amendments, as already pointed out, make two important changes in present Rule 4011. They
delete subdivision (d) limiting the discovery of trial preparation material, and subdivision (f) forbidding any discovery which would require a deponent, whether or not a party, to give an opinion as an
expert witness over his objection. These changes have already been discussed under Rules 4003.3 to
4003.5, supra. Minor stylistic changes have been made in subdivision (b). The provision protecting
trade secrets or other confidential research, development, or commercial information has been transposed from subdivision (c) to Rule 4012(a)(9).

Rule 4012. Protective Orders.
(a) Upon motion by a party or by the person from whom discovery or deposition is sought, and for good cause shown, the court may make any order which
justice requires to protect a party or person from unreasonable annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, burden or expense, including one or more of the following:
(1) that the discovery or deposition shall be prohibited;
231 Rule 4011 GENERAL
4000-36
(361804) No. 454 Sep. 12 Copyright  2012 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
(2) that the discovery or deposition shall be only on specified terms and
conditions, including a designation of the time and place;
(3) that the discovery or deposition shall be only by a method of discovery
or deposition other than that selected by the party seeking discovery or deposition;
(4) that certain matters shall not be inquired into;
(5) that the scope of discovery or deposition shall be limited;
(6) that discovery or deposition shall be conducted with no one present
except persons designated by the court;
(7) that a deposition shall be sealed and shall be opened only by order of
the court;
(8) that the parties simultaneously shall file specified documents or information enclosed in sealed envelopes to be opened as directed by the court;
(9) that a trade secret or other confidential research, development or commercial information shall not be disclosed or be disclosed only in a designated
way.
If the motion for a protective order is denied in whole or in part, the court may,
on such terms and conditions as are just, order that any party or person provide
or permit discovery.
Official Note: Motions for a protective order are governed by the motion rules, Rule 208.1
et seq. A court of common pleas, by local rule numbered Local Rule 208.2(e), may require that
the motion contain a certification that counsel has conferred or attempted to confer with all
interested parties in order to resolve the matter without court action.
(b) At any time during the taking of a deposition, on motion of any party or
of the deponent, the court may order the officer conducting the examination to
cease forthwith from taking the deposition, or may limit the scope and manner of
the taking of the deposition as provided in subdivision (a). If the order made terminates the examination it shall be resumed thereafter only upon order of the
court. Upon demand of the objecting party or deponent, the taking of the deposition shall be suspended for the time necessary to make a motion for an order and
to obtain the court’s ruling thereon.
Explanatory Note
Under the prior practice, protective orders were available in depositions or discovery on oral
examination (Rule 4012) or on written interrogatories (Rule 4004(e)). They were not specifically
included in interrogatories to parties (Rule 4005) or in general discovery (Rule 4007). The amendment provides a comprehensive Rule which covers all depositions and all discovery. This follows
Fed. R.Civ.P. 26(c).
The eight subdivisions of prior Rule 4012(a) remain, with stylistic changes which broaden their
scope. No major change is made in principle. A new ninth subdivision is added, transposing the provisions of former Rule 4011(c) dealing with trade secrets, research and development. The nine subdivisions are defined as examples of the broad principle of protecting against ‘‘unreasonable annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, burden or expense.’’ The power of the court should be adequate to
furnish any needed protection.
DEPOSITIONS AND DISCOVERY 231 Rule 4012
4000-37
(301347) No. 350 Jan. 04
A self-explanatory clause is added at the end of subdivision (a) empowering the court, if it denies
the protective order, to order that discovery go forward.
The amendment permits a simple motion procedure for a protective order. This is not necessarily
the exclusive procedure for obtaining relief. The various forms of protective order authorized by the
Rule can be included by the court in orders entered at other stages of the litigation, if appropriate. For
example, a stay of all proceedings will automatically block any pending or prospective discovery.
The last sentence of former subdivision (b) is deleted, since all provisions for expenses and attorneys’ fees as sanctions are consolidated in Rule 4019, infra.

Immediately preceding text appears at serial pages (243960) to (243961) and (255409).
Rule 4013. Stay of Proceedings.
The filing of a motion for a protective order shall not stay the deposition, production, entry on land or other discovery to which the motion is directed unless
the court shall so order. The court for good cause shown may stay any or all proceedings in the action until disposition of the motion.
Explanatory Note
Former Rule 4013 provided that the filing of any motion or application directed to a deposition or
to discovery would automatically stay proceedings with respect to that deposition or discovery. Further, the court could also stay all proceedings in the action until disposition of the motion or application. It had no counterpart in the Federal Rules. Under federal practice the filing of a motion for a
protective order will not constitute a stay unless a stay order is granted.
The automatic stay under former Rule 4013 presented the possibility of misuse. Assume one party
notices an emergency deposition of a going, aged or infirm witness. Assume his opponent files a
motion for a protective order. This will automatically stay the deposition. The witness may be dead
or may have left the Commonwealth before the motion is disposed of and the stay is lifted.
If the motion, in such a case, was frivolous and filed in bad faith, simply to assure no deposition
before death or departure, Rule 4019(h) authorized the imposition of counsel fees and costs. This will
be a hollow benefit if the testimony of an important witness is irrevocably lost.
A number of alternative solutions for controlling misuse were suggested, including a provision for
timely filing as a prerequisite to automatic stay, or limiting the automatic stay to 48 hours unless the
court granted a further stay. None of these adequately solved the difficulties presented by the automatic stay procedure. Timely filing was imprecise as to time and the fixed 48-hour period failed to
reach critical situations in the case of going or aged witnesses.
The amendment therefore abolishes all automatic stay and adopts the federal practice requiring a
stay order in all cases. It is recognized that this will impose on the courts the creation of necessary
administrative machinery to insure prompt access to and prompt action by the court. A judge must be
available on short notice.
This has worked well in the federal courts and should work equally well in our courts.
231 Rule 4013 GENERAL
4000-38
(301348) No. 350 Jan. 04 Copyright  2004 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
In urgent discovery and deposition matters, there is no place for motion and argument lists held
only once a month or quarterly. This is not a matter limited to protective orders; it cuts across the
whole field of obstructive and dilatory tactics to frustrate discovery.
In many counties the machinery already exists, with special assignment of motion judges available
at all times. Most counties also provide for emergency judges assigned for weekends and holidays, so
that no major changes in administrative machinery should be required.
There are, in addition, a number of other Rules which provide for the equivalent of self-executing
stays without special allowance, so that the need for emergency action in many instances will be
obviated.
(a) Rule 4003.4 as amended permits a party to refuse to produce the statement of a party or a
witness. He needs no stay order, because the Rule puts the burden on the requesting party to move
for an order for production.
(b) Rule 4006(a)(1) provides that an answer to written interrogatories to a party may include
grounds for objection. This similarly puts the burden on the inquirer to move for dismissal of the
objection and a direction that the interrogatory be answered.
(c) Rule 4019 contains a group of additional instances where the burden is placed on the moving
party to move for relief on the basis of an unjustifiable refusal of a party or witness to respond. These
include failure to answer interrogatories (under Rules 4004 and 4005), refusal of a party to appear for
deposition after notice, refusal of a party to obey an order of court, inducing a person to refuse to
obey an order of court, refusal to obey an order of court under Rule 4009 for production and inspection of documents or things or entry upon land, refusal to obey an order of court under Rule 4010 for
a medical examination, and, generally, a failure to make discovery or to obey an order of court relating to discovery.
(d) Rule 4014, regulating requests for admission, provides that the answering party may raise
objections in his answer. The burden is placed on the requesting party to move for a determination of
the sufficiency of the objection. The requirement of a stay order to protect against abusive discovery should not be an excessive burden on the parties, nor should the courts be swamped with applications for a stay. The federal experience and the Pennsylvania experience suggest that there are
adequate means by which counsel can protect his client and his witnesses from abusive discovery
other than by seeking protective orders, and that the requirement of asking the court for a stay order
in a significant case is a minor procedural act.

Rule 4014. Request for Admission.
(a) A party may serve upon any other party a written request for the admission, for purposes of the pending action only, of the truth of any matters within
the scope of Rules 4003.1 through 4003.5 inclusive set forth in the request that
relate to statements or opinions of fact or of the application of law to fact,
including the genuineness, authenticity, correctness, execution, signing, delivery,
mailing or receipt of any document described in the request. Copies of documents
shall be served with the request unless they have been or are otherwise furnished
or available for inspection and copying in the county. The request may, without
leave of court, be served upon the plaintiff after commencement of the action and
upon any other party with or after service of the original process upon that party.

(b) Each matter of which an admission is requested shall be separately set
forth. The matter is admitted unless, within thirty days after service of the
request, or within such shorter or longer time as the court may allow, the party to
whom the request is directed serves upon the party requesting the admission an
answer verified by the party or an objection, signed by the party or by the party’s

attorney; but, unless the court shortens the time, a defendant shall not be required
to serve answers or objections before the expiration of forty-five days after service of the original process upon him or her. If objection is made, the reasons
therefor shall be stated. The answer shall admit or deny the matter or set forth in
detail the reasons why the answering party cannot truthfully do so. A denial shall
fairly meet the substance of the requested admission, and when good faith
requires that a party qualify the answer or deny only a part of the matter of which
an admission is requested, the party shall specify so much of it as is true and
qualify or deny the remainder. An answering party may not give lack of information or knowledge as a reason for failure to admit or deny unless the answering
party states that he or she has made reasonable inquiry and that the information
known or readily obtainable by him or her is insufficient to enable him or her to
admit or deny. A party who considers that a matter of which an admission has
been requested presents a genuine issue for trial may not, on that ground alone,
object to the request. That party may, subject to the provisions of Rule 4019(d),
deny the matter or set forth reasons why he or she cannot admit or deny it.
Official Note: The requirements of an answer are governed by this rule and not by Rule
1029(b).
(c) The party who has requested the admission may move to determine the
sufficiency of the answer or objection. Unless the court determines that an objection is justified, it shall order that an answer be served. If the court determines
that an answer does not comply with the requirements of this rule, it may order
either that the matter is admitted or that an amended answer be served. The court
may, in lieu of these orders, determine that final disposition of the request be
made at a pre-trial conference or at a designated time prior to trial.
(d) Any matter admitted under this rule is conclusively established unless the
court on motion permits withdrawal or amendment of the admission. Subject to
the provisions of Rule 212.3 governing pre-trial conferences, the court may permit withdrawal or amendment when the presentation of the merits of the action
will be subserved thereby and the party who obtained the admission fails to satisfy the court that withdrawal or amendment will prejudice him or her in maintaining the action or defense on the merits. Any admission by a party under this
rule is for the purpose of the pending action only and is not an admission by the
party for any other purpose nor may it be used against the party in any other proceeding.
Explanatory Note
Prior Rule 4014 has been completely revised to conform to Fed. R.Civ.P. 36 as amended in 1970.
The amendments make the following significant changes in present practice:
(1) The scope of the requests is enlarged. The prior Rule permitted requests for admission only
as to truth of any relevant matters of fact or the genuineness of any writing, agreement, or record.
DEPOSITIONS AND DISCOVERY 231 Rule 4014
4000-39
(255411) No. 296 Jul. 99
The revision will cover all matters within the scope of deposition Rules 4003.1 through 4003.5. This
includes all matters that relate to the truth of any matter, but also to statements or opinions of fact or
of the application of law to fact.
(2) The request may be made on any party; the prior Rule limited the request to ‘‘adverse’’ parties. The plaintiff may serve a request on any defending party after the party has been served with
original process. A defending party may serve a request on the plaintiff at any time after the action
is commenced.
(3) The respondent must answer or object. The answer must admit or deny in whole or in part.
The form of a denial is clarified. Lack of information or knowledge is an insufficient denial, unless
he avers that he has made reasonable inquiry and that the information available is still insufficient to
enable him to admit or deny. Subdivision (b), unlike the Federal Rule, requires a sworn answer. The
answer or the objections may be signed by the attorney.
(4) The form of the denial will not be governed by Pleading Rule 1029(b). Subdivision (b) provides that a denial shall fairly meet the substance of the requested admission and when good faith
requires that a party qualify his answer or deny only a part of the matter of which an admission is
requested, he shall specify so much of it as is true and qualify or deny the remainder. Thus, a good
faith general denial which would be insufficient under Rule 1029(b) might be sufficient here.
(5) Where the respondent believes that a request for admission involves a genuine issue of fact
for trial, this alone does not make the request objectionable. He must deny the matter or set forth reasons why he cannot admit or deny it. Sanction Rule 4019(d), which is specially mentioned in subdivision (b), provides that if, at trial, a party is required to prove that which should have been admitted,
the expenses, including counsel fees, of proving such matters may be imposed upon the respondent
unless the admission was of no substantial importance, or the request could have been held objectionable, or the respondent reasonably believed he could prevail at trial on the issue, or there was other
good reason for the failure to admit.
(6) The time periods for answer or objection are conformed to the Federal Rule and extended
from 10 to 30 days or to 45 days after service of original process.
(7) A specific procedure is provided in subdivision (c) for an early determination of the sufficiency of an answer or objection. The prior Rule provided no such determination before trial, and a
party often came to trial uncertain whether the answer constituted an admission or denial. The
amendment provides that the court may order the matter to be admitted or an amended answer to be
served, or it may postpone the final determination of this issue to pretrial conferences or a designated
time prior to trial.
(8) Finally, subdivision (d) sets forth the terms under which an admission may be withdrawn or
amended and the effect of possible prejudice to the inquirer from an amendment or withdrawal. It also
contains the important condition that the admission is localized in the pending action and cannot be
used against him in any other proceeding.

Rule 4015. Persons Before Whom Depositions May be Taken.
(a) Within the United States or within a territory or insular possession subject to the dominion of the United States, depositions shall be taken before an
officer authorized to administer oaths by the laws of the United States or of this
231 Rule 4015 GENERAL
4000-40
(255412) No. 296 Jul. 99 Copyright  1999 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
Commonwealth or of the place where the examination is held, or before a person
appointed by the court in which the action is pending. A person so appointed shall
have power to administer oaths and take testimony.
(b) In a foreign country, depositions may be taken
(1) on notice before a person authorized to administer oaths in the place in
which the examination is held, either by the law thereof or by the law of the
United States, or
(2) before a person commissioned by the court in which the action is
pending, and a person so commissioned shall have the power by virtue of the
commission to administer any necessary oath and take testimony, or
(3) pursuant to a letter rogatory. A commission or a letter rogatory shall be
issued on application and notice and on terms that are just and appropriate. It
is not requisite to the issuance of a commission or a letter rogatory that the
taking of the deposition in any other manner is impracticable or inconvenient;
and both a commission and a letter rogatory may be issued in proper cases. A
notice or commission may designate the person before whom the deposition is
to be taken either by name or descriptive title. A letter rogatory may be
addressed ‘‘To the Appropriate Authority in (here name the country).’’ Evidence obtained in response to a letter rogatory need not be excluded merely for
the reason that it is not a verbatim transcript or that the testimony was not taken
under oath or for any similar departure from the requirements for depositions
taken within the United States under these rules.
(c) No deposition shall be taken before a person who is a relative, employee
or attorney of any of the parties, or who is a relative or employee of such attorney, or who is financially interested in the action.
Explanatory Note
The amendments conform the Rule to Fed. R.Civ.P. 28. They make the following changes in
present practice:
(1) When depositions are to be taken within the United States or a territory or insular possession,
the list of persons authorized to take the deposition is increased by adding a person appointed by the
court in which the action is pending. That person thereby acquires the power to administer an oath.
This permits the taking of depositions in isolated places where no one would ordinarily be found who
is authorized to administer an oath, and where the parties do not stipulate that the oath be waived
under Rule 4002.
(2) When depositions are to be taken in foreign countries, the list of persons who may take the
deposition will now include any person authorized to administer an oath in the place in which the
examination is held, either by the law of that place or by the law of the United States. Commissions
or letters rogatory remain available, and a person commissioned by the court will have the power to
administer oaths or to take testimony by virtue of his commission. It is not requisite to the issuance
of a commission or a letter rogatory that the taking of a deposition in any other matter is impracticable or inconvenient and both a commission and a letter may be issued in proper cases.
In many cases international judicial assistance may be required, especially if there is a noncooperative witness whose appearance must be compelled. A check should be made to see if the foreign country involved is a signatory to the Hague Convention for the Taking of Evidence Abroad. If
DEPOSITIONS AND DISCOVERY 231 Rule 4015
4000-41
(255413) No. 296 Jul. 99
so, the procedure under that Convention may be useful. (3) Evidence obtained in response to a
letter rogatory may not be excluded merely for the reason that it is not a verbatim transcript or that
the testimony was not taken under oath or for any similar departure from the technique used in depositions taken within the United States. This provision is essential to permit the use of testimony taken
in non-common law countries where testimony may be taken before a judge or other officer who
questions the witness, sometimes without administering an oath and without a verbatim transcript, and
who prepares a summary of the testimony which the witness has given. While the court may not
exclude the evidence for this reason, its value or weight may be affected by the method of taking or
recording the testimony.

Rule 4016. Taking of Depositions. Objections.
(a) Objection to taking a deposition because of the disqualification of the
person before whom it is to be taken is waived unless made before the taking of
the deposition begins or as soon thereafter as the disqualification becomes known
or could be discovered with reasonable diligence.
(b) Objections to the competency of a witness or to the competency, relevancy, or materiality of the testimony are not waived by failure to make them
before or during the taking of the deposition, unless the ground of the objection
is one which was known to the objecting party and which might have been obviated or removed if made at that time.
(c) Errors and irregularities occurring at the oral examination in the manner
of taking the deposition, in the form of oral questions or answers, in the oath or
affirmation, or in the conduct of parties and errors of any kind which might have
been obviated, removed, or cured if objections had been promptly made, are
waived unless seasonable objection is made at the taking of the deposition.
(d) All errors and irregularities in the notice for taking a deposition are
waived unless written objection is promptly served upon the party giving the
notice.
Official Note: Objections to the form of written interrogatories must be made as provided
by Rule 4004(b).

Rule 4017. Transcript of Testimony. Objections.
(a) The person before whom the deposition is taken shall put the witness on
oath or affirmation and shall personally or by someone acting under his or her
direction and in his or her presence record the testimony of the witness.
(b) The testimony of the witness shall be transcribed. Objections to the manner of preparation or the correctness of the transcript are waived unless they are
filed in writing with the court promptly after the grounds of objection become
known or could have been discovered with reasonable diligence.
(c) When the testimony is fully transcribed a copy of the deposition with the
original signature page shall be submitted to the witness for inspection and signing and shall be read to or by the witness and shall be signed by the witness,
unless the inspection, reading and signing are waived by the witness and by all
parties who attended the taking of the deposition, or the witness is ill or cannot
be found or refuses to sign. Any changes in form or substance which the witness
desires to make shall be entered upon the deposition by the person before whom
it was taken with a statement of the reasons given by the witness for making the
changes. If the deposition is not signed by the witness within thirty days of its
submission to the witness, the person before whom the deposition was taken shall
sign it and state on the record the fact of the waiver or of the illness or absence
of the witness or the refusal to sign together with the reason, if any, given therefor; and the deposition may then be used as fully as though signed, unless the
court holds that the reasons given for the refusal to sign require rejection of the
deposition in whole or in part.
(d) The person before whom the deposition is taken shall certify on the deposition that the witness was duly sworn and that the deposition is a true record of
the testimony given by the witness.
(e) In lieu of participating in the oral examination, parties served with notice
of taking a deposition may transmit written interrogatories to the person taking
the deposition, who shall propound them to the witness and record the answers
verbatim.
(f) Upon payment of reasonable charges, the person before whom the deposition was taken shall furnish a copy thereof to any party or to the deponent.
Explanatory Note
Minor stylistic changes have been made in this Rule. In addition, a time limit of 30 days is given
the witness to make any changes in the transcript of the deposition and to sign it.

Rule 4017.1. Video Depositions.
(a) Any deposition upon oral examination may be taken as a matter of course
as a video deposition by means of simultaneous audio and visual electronic
recording. Except as provided by this rule, the rules of this chapter governing the
practice and procedure in depositions and discovery shall apply.
(1) Any party may have a video deposition recorded simultaneously by
stenographic means as provided by this chapter.
(2) A video deposition may be used in court only if accompanied by a
transcript of the deposition.
(b) Every notice or subpoena for the taking of a video deposition shall state
(1) that the deposition is to be taken as a video deposition,
(2) the name and address of the person whose deposition is to be taken,
(3) the name and address of the officer before whom it is to be taken,
(4) whether the deposition is to be simultaneously recorded by stenographic means, and
(5) the name and address of the video operator and of his or her employer.
The operator may be an employe of the attorney taking the deposition.
(c) The deposition shall begin by the operator stating on camera (1) his or her
name and address, (2) the name and address of his or her employer, (3) the date,
time and place of the deposition, (4) the caption of the case, (5) the name of the
witness, and (6) the party on whose behalf the deposition is being taken. The
officer before whom the deposition is taken shall then identify himself or herself
and swear the witness on camera. At the conclusion of the deposition the operator shall state on camera that the deposition is concluded. When the length of the
deposition requires the use of more than one videotape, the end of the videotape
and the beginning of each succeeding videotape shall be announced on camera by
the operator.
(d) The deposition shall be timed by a digital clock on camera which shall
show continually each hour, minute and second of each videotape of the deposition.
(e) No signature of the witness shall be required.
(f) The attorney for the party taking the deposition shall take custody of and
be responsible for the safeguarding of the videotape and shall permit the viewing
of and shall provide a copy of the videotape or the audio portion thereof upon
the request and at the cost of a party.
(g) In addition to the uses permitted by Rule 4020 a video deposition of a
medical witness or any witness called as an expert, other than a party, may be
used at trial for any purpose whether or not the witness is available to testify.
(h) At a trial or hearing that part of the audio portion of a video deposition
which is offered in evidence and admitted, or which is excluded on objection,
shall be transcribed in the same manner as the testimony of other witnesses. The
videotape shall be marked as an exhibit and may remain in the custody of the
court.

(327012) No. 392 Jul. 07 Copyright  2007 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
Official Note: Local rules and practice shall regulate the procedure for handling objections
to questions and answers on the videotape. Suggested devices include inter alia, previewing by
the judge and counsel and withholding from the evidence material to which objections are sustained; or having the operator turn off the audio portion of the videotape at the trial or hearing
to exclude objectionable material or the use of ‘‘fast forward’’ by the operator at the trial or
hearing to eliminate both the image and the sound of the objectionable material.
(i) As used in this rule, ‘‘videotape’’ includes all media on which a video
deposition may be recorded.
Explanatory Note
This Rule remains unchanged.
Pennsylvania was one of the first states to authorize videotape depositions. Although adopted in
April, 1973 as part of a two-year experimental program, the Rule appears to have worked well in
practice.

Rule 4019. Sanctions.
(a)(1) The court may, on motion, make an appropriate order if
(i) a party fails to serve answers, sufficient answers or objections to
written interrogatories under Rule 4005;
(ii) a corporation or other entity fails to make a designation under Rule
4004(a)(2) or 4007.1(e);

fails to appear before the person who is to take the deposition;
(v) a party or deponent, or an officer or managing agent of a party or
deponent, induces a witness not to appear;
(vi) a party or an officer, or managing agent of a party refuses or induces

(vii) a party, in response to a request for production or inspection made
under Rule 4009, fails to respond that inspection will be permitted as
requested or fails to permit inspection as requested;
(viii) a party or person otherwise fails to make discovery or to obey an

Official Note: Motions for sanctions are governed by the motion rules, Rule 208.1 et seq.
A court of common pleas, by local rule numbered Local Rule 208.2(e), may require that the
motion contain a certification that counsel has conferred or attempted to confer with all interested parties in order to resolve the matter without court action.
(b) If a deponent refuses to be sworn or to answer any question, the deposition shall be completed on other matters or adjourned, as the proponent of the
question may prefer. Thereafter, on reasonable notice to all persons affected
thereby, the proponent may apply to a proper court in the county where the deposition is being taken or to the court in which the action is pending, for an order
compelling the witness to be sworn or to answer, under penalty of contempt,
except that where the deposition of a witness not a party is to be taken outside
the Commonwealth, the application shall be made only to a court of the jurisdiction in which the deposition is to be taken.
(c) The court, when acting under subdivision (a) of this rule, may make
(1) an order that the matters regarding which the questions were asked, or
the character or description of the thing or land, or the contents of the paper, or
any other designated fact shall be taken to be established for the purposes of
the action in accordance with the claim of the party obtaining the order;
(2) an order refusing to allow the disobedient party to support or oppose
designated claims or defenses, or prohibiting such party from introducing in
evidence designated documents, things or testimony, or from introducing evidence of physical or mental condition;
(3) an order striking out pleadings or parts thereof, or staying further proceedings until the order is obeyed, or entering a judgment of non pros or by
default against the disobedient party or party advising the disobedience;
(4) an order imposing punishment for contempt, except that a party may
not be punished for contempt for a refusal to submit to a physical or mental
examination under Rule 4010;
(5) such order with regard to the failure to make discovery as is just.
(d) If at the trial or hearing, a party who has requested admissions as authorized by Rule 4014 proves the matter which the other party has failed to admit as
requested, the court on motion may enter an order taxing as costs against the
other party the reasonable expenses incurred in making such proof, including
attorney’s fees, unless the court finds that
231 Rule 4019 GENERAL

(327014) No. 392 Jul. 07 Copyright  2007 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
(1) the request was or could have been held objectionable pursuant to Rule
4014, or
(2) the admission sought was of no substantial importance, or
(3) the party failing to admit had reasonable ground to believe that he or
she might prevail on the matter, or
(4) there was other good reason for the failure to admit.
(e) If the party giving the notice of the taking of a deposition fails to attend
and proceed therewith and another party attends in person or by attorney pursuant to the notice, the court may order the party giving the notice to pay to such
other party the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred by such other party
and his or her attorney in so attending, including attorney’s fees.
(f) If the party giving the notice of the taking of a deposition of a witness
fails to serve a subpoena upon the witness and because of such failure the witness does not attend, and if another party attends in person or by attorney expecting the deposition of that witness to be taken, the court may order the party giving the notice to pay to such other party the amount of the reasonable expenses
incurred by such other party and his or her attorney in so attending, including
attorney’s fees.
(g)(1) Except as otherwise provided in these rules, if following the refusal,
objection or failure of a party or person to comply with any provision of this
chapter, the court, after opportunity for hearing, enters an order compelling compliance and the order is not obeyed, the court on a subsequent motion for sanctions may, if the motion is granted, require the party or deponent whose conduct
necessitated the motions or the party or attorney advising such conduct or both
of them to pay to the moving party the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s
fees, incurred in obtaining the order of compliance and the order for sanctions,
unless the court finds that the opposition to the motion was substantially justified
or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.
(2) If the motion for sanctions is denied, the court shall, after opportunity
for hearing, require the moving party or the attorney advising the motion or
both of them to pay to the party or deponent who opposed the motion the reasonable expenses incurred in opposing the motion, including attorney’s fees,
unless the court finds that the making of the motion was substantially justified
or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.
(3) If the motion for sanctions is granted in part and denied in part, the
court may apportion the reasonable expenses incurred in relation to the motion
among the parties and persons in a just manner.
Official Note: For other special provisions authorizing the award of expenses including
attorney fees see Rule 4008 where a deposition is to be taken more than 100 miles from the
courthouse; 4019(d) where a party unjustifiably refuses to admit causing the other party to incur
expenses of proof at trial; 4019(e) and (f) where a party notices a deposition and fails to appear
or to subpoena a witness to appear causing the other party to incur unnecessary expenses; and
4019(h) where a party files motions or applications for the purpose of delay or bad faith.

(h) If the filing of a motion or making of an application under this chapter is
for the purpose of delay or in bad faith, the court may impose on the party making the motion or application the reasonable costs, including attorney’s fees,
actually incurred by the opposing party by reason of such delay or bad faith. A
party upon whom such costs have been imposed may neither (1) take any further
step in the suit without prior leave of court so long as such costs remain unpaid
nor (2) recover such costs if ultimately successful in the action.
(i) A witness whose identity has not been revealed as provided in this chapter shall not be permitted to testify on behalf of the defaulting party at the trial of
the action. However, if the failure to disclose the identity of the witness is the
result of extenuating circumstances beyond the control of the defaulting party, the
court may grant a continuance or other appropriate relief.
(j) Expenses and attorney’s fees may not be imposed upon the Commonwealth under this rule.
Explanatory Note
Former Rule 4019 worked reasonably well since it was first adopted in 1950. Amendments were,
however, necessary to reflect the many amendments in other Rules. Opportunity was taken to make
additional amendments to approach more closely the language of Fed. R.Civ.P. 37.
(1) Subdivision (a)(viii) is a blanket authorization to the court to enter a sanction order whenever
there is a failure to make discovery or to obey an order of the court. The preceding subsections of
subdivision (a) set out a series of specific violations of Rules 4004, 4005, 4007.1, 4007.2, 4009 and
4010 which are included in the blanket authorization. These are only illustrations and do not limit the
all-inclusive coverage of subsection (viii).
(2) Prior Rule 4019(a) required a showing that an offender had acted ‘‘wilfully.’’ This word has
been deleted. The court may impose sanctions even if the failure is not wilful. Wilfulness of course
may be a factor in determining the extent of the sanction but it will not be an essential condition precedent to the power to impose a sanction.
(3) A new subdivision (a)(2), taken from Fed. R.Civ.P. 37(4), provides that failure to permit
deposition or discovery may not be excused on the ground that the discovery sought is objectionable,
unless the party failing to act has filed an appropriate objection or has applied for a protective order.
Subdivision (b) remains unchanged, except that the procedure for imposition of expenses and
counsel fees is transposed to the new subdivision (g).
Subdivision (c) remains unchanged except for the addition of a catch-all subsection (5).
Subdivision (d) permits an award of expenses including counsel fees where a party has unjustifiably failed or refused to admit requests for admissions under Rule 4014, and the inquirer is thereafter
compelled to prove the unadmitted facts at the trial. This has been discussed in the commentary to
Rule 4014, supra.
Subdivisions (e) and (f) are unchanged. These also permit the sanction of expenses, including
counsel fees. These provisions have been rarely invoked in practice. They remind counsel that lack of
professional courtesy in notifying opposing counsel that parties or witnesses may not attend a deposition may subject them to sanctions.
Subdivision (g) contains novel provisions with respect to the imposition of expenses and counsel
fees in situations other than those regulated in subdivisions (d), (e), (f) and (h). These four subsections cover requests for admissions, failure of a party or a witness to attend depositions and the
filing motion or application in bad faith or for purposes of delay.
231 Rule 4019 GENERAL
4000-48
(301354) No. 350 Jan. 04 Copyright  2004 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
These constitutes a relatively small area of deposition and discovery practice. They do not include
the situations regulated in subdivisions (a), (b) and (c), which cover the more common situations of
interrogatories and answers, oral depositions on notice, production of documents and things and
physical and mental examinations.
The prior Rule contained no provision for expenses and counsel fees in these situations except in
subdivision (b), the case where a witness refused to be sworn or to answer.
Fed. R.Civ.P. 37(a)(4) provides that, if a party is successful in obtaining an order of compliance,
the court shall, at the same time and without waiting to see if the order of compliance is obeyed,
award expenses including counsel fees unless the failure, refusal or objection of the offending party
is found to be substantially justified. Conversely, the court shall impose counsel fees against the parties unsuccessful in seeking a compliance order unless their conduct was substantially justified. If the
motion is granted in part and refused in part, the court could in its discretion apportion expenses in
a just manner.
The amendment suggest a new approach. It refers generally to ‘‘refusal, objection or failure of a
party or person to comply with any provision of this chapter’’ which could hardly be more allinclusive. However, it preserves the special provisions of subdivisions (d), (e), (f) and (h) by the
phrase ‘‘except as otherwise provided in these rules.’’ As to those situations not covered by subdivisions (d), (e), (f) and (h), it requires a ‘‘two step’’ procedure rather than the ‘‘single step’’ procedure
of the Federal Rule.
The first step under subdivision (g)(1) is a motion to compel compliance. If, after a hearing, the
motion is granted and depositions or discovery are ordered and the party against whom it is directed
complies, that is the end of the matter as far as expenses and counsel fees are concerned. There can
be no award of expenses and fees. If the order to comply is not obeyed, the aggrieved party may file
a new motion to impose sanctions. The court, at this ‘‘second step’’ of the proceedings, may award
expenses and counsel fees for either or both steps depending upon how the court views the conduct
of the defaulting party and his counsel. The Rule permits the court to decline any award if the court
finds that the opposition to the motion was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an
award unjust. Similarly, if the second step procedure is unsuccessful and no award is made, subdivision (g)(2) authorizes the court to impose expenses including counsel fees on the moving party unless
the court finds that the making of the second step motion was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust. Finally, subdivision (g)(3) permits the court to apportion expenses among the parties if the motion for sanctions is granted in part and denied in part.
An order of compliance entered in the first step of the proceedings, which is not obeyed, will ordinarily supply substantial justification for the second step procedure requesting sanctions including
expenses and counsel fees. There may be exceptional circumstances where the second step will fail.
For example, there may be a failure to notify the respondent and the failure to comply may have
resulted from no knowledge of the order. Or, the order of compliance may have directed the respondent to do something which the Rules do not permit or which was beyond the jurisdiction of the court.
Reference is made in the commentary to Rule 4003 of a possible ambiguity in the availability of
sanctions under the prior Rule for failure of a party to appear for a deposition taken on a petition,
motion or rule. Any such ambiguity will be removed by the all-inclusive language of subdivision
(g)(1).
The amendment authorizes the court, if it grants the motion for sanctions, to impose the payment
of the expenses on the guilty party or deponent or on the attorney who advised the conduct or on both.
If the motion for sanctions is refused, the court is authorized to impose the expenses on the moving
party or on the attorney who advised the filing of the motion or on both.
These are powerful disciplinary tools, if the courts will use them. The placing of the burden to
escape the expenses and counsel fees on the shoulders of the losing party, plus the new provision for
imposing the sanction on the attorney, will hopefully assure compliance with the Discovery Rules and
a minimum of sanction proceedings.
Subdivision (h) adds a new provision for expenses and counsel fees not expressly found in the
Federal Rule. It provides that if the filing of a motion or application is in bad faith or for the purpose
DEPOSITIONS AND DISCOVERY 231 Rule 4019
4000-49
(301355) No. 350 Jan. 04
of delay, the court may impose on the party making the motion reasonable costs, including attorney’s
fees, incurred by the opposing party by reason of such delay or bad faith. The party on whom such
costs have been imposed may take no further steps in the action without leave of court so long as the
costs remain unpaid and may not recover such cost if ultimately successful in the action. The language
of this Rule has been adapted from Rule 217 governing the imposition of costs in connection with
continuances.
Independent of the above provisions, Rule 4008 provides that, as to oral depositions to be taken
more than 100 miles from the courthouse, expenses including counsel fees may be imposed in the
discretion of the court. This is of course not a sanction provision.
Subdivision (i) adds a new provision for sanctions for failure to identify witnesses as to whom discovery has been sought. A witness whose identity has not been revealed as provided by the Rules will
not be permitted to testify at trial. If the failure to disclose his identity was the result of extenuating
circumstances beyond the control of the defaulting party, the court may grant a continuance or other
appropriate relief.
Subdivision (j) is former subdivision (g) with only a minor stylistic change. It forbids the imposition of expenses and counsel fees on the Commonwealth.
The amendment does not compel a party who has identified a witness under Rule 4003.1 as having
‘‘knowledge of discoverable matter’’ to call the witness at the trial. Nor, except as to the disclosure
under Rule 4003.5(b) of the identity of experts expected to be called at trial, is a party required to
present a ‘‘witness list’’ of those he intends to call at trial. Nor can an opponent claim surprise if an
identified witness is not called on the ground that this tactic deprives him of the opportunity for
cross-examination. He could have taken his deposition before trial.
The Rule does not deal specifically with the difficult problem of rebuttal witnesses. A plaintiff may
not identify persons who can testify to rebut a particular defense because the defendant’s pleadings
and discovery do not clearly identify that defense. If the defendant introduces this defense at the trial,
should the court exclude the plaintiff’s rebuttal witness, on the ground that he did not ‘‘identify’’ this
witness? A skilled plaintiff can avoid this danger by careful discovery from the defendant, which will
force a disclosure of all the defenses.
The problem, of course, can arise only if the defendant has asked the plaintiff to identify all persons ‘‘having knowledge,’’ and the plaintiff has done so.

3551; amended April 12, 1999, effective July 1, 1999, 29 Pa.B. 2281; amended October 24, 2003,
effective 9 months after the date of the Order, 33 Pa.B. 5506. Immediately preceding text appears at

Rule 4020. Use of Depositions at Trial.
(a) At the trial, any part or all of a deposition, so far as admissible under the
rules of evidence, may be used against any party who was present or represented
at the taking of the deposition or who had notice thereof if required, in accordance with any one of the following provisions:
(1) Any deposition may be used by any party for the purpose of contradicting or impeaching the testimony of a deponent as a witness, or as permitted by
the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence.
(2) The deposition of a party or of any one who at the time of taking the
deposition was an officer, director, or managing agent of a party or a person
designated under Rule 4004(a)(2) or 4007.1(e) to testify on behalf of a public
or private corporation, partnership or association or governmental agency
which is a party, may be used by an adverse party for any purpose.
231 Rule 4020 GENERAL
4000-50
(301356) No. 350 Jan. 04 Copyright  2004 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
(3) The deposition of a witness, whether or not a party, may be used by any
party for any purpose if the court finds
(a) that the witness is dead, or
(b) that the witness is at a greater distance than one hundred miles from
the place of trial or is outside the Commonwealth, unless it appears that the
absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the deposition, or
that the witness is unable to attend or testify because of age, sickness, infirmity or imprisonment, or that the party offering the deposition has been
unable to procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena, or upon application and notice that such exceptional circumstances exist as to make it
desirable, in the interest of justice and with due regard to the importance of
presenting the testimony of witnesses orally in open court, to allow the
deposition to be used.
(4) If only part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party, any other
party may require the offering party to introduce all of it which is relevant to
the part introduced, and any party may introduce any other parts.
Official Note:: See the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence for a broader statement of this rule.
(5) A deposition upon oral examination of a medical witness, other than a
party, may be used at trial for any purpose whether or not the witness is available to testify.
(b) Substitution of parties does not affect the right to use depositions previously taken; and, when an action has been dismissed and another action involving the same subject is afterward brought between the same parties or their representatives or successors in interest, all depositions lawfully taken in the former
action may be used in the latter as if originally taken therein. A deposition previously taken may also be used as permitted by the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence.
(c) Subject to the provisions of Rule 4016(b), objection may be made at the
trial or hearing to receiving in evidence any deposition or part thereof for any
reason which would require the exclusion of the evidence if the witness were then
present and testifying.
(d) A party shall not be deemed to make a person his or her own witness for
any purpose by taking the person’s deposition. The introduction in evidence of
the deposition or any part thereof for any purpose other than that of contradicting
or impeaching the deponent makes the deponent the witness of the party introducing the deposition, but this shall not apply to the use of an adverse party of a
deposition as described in subdivision (a)(2) of this rule. At the trial or hearing
any party may rebut any relevant evidence contained in a deposition whether
introduced by that party or by any other party.
Explanatory Note
Except for minor stylistic amendments this Rule remains unchanged, except for a new subdivision
(a)(5) permitting the use at trial of a deposition upon oral examination of a medical witness, other than
a party, whether or not the witness is available to testify.
DEPOSITIONS AND DISCOVERY 231 Rule 4020
4000-51
(422101) No. 605 Apr. 25
The rising costs of obtaining the testimony at trial of medical experts and the inconvenience which
may be caused to the medical witness and to his patients, have suggested relaxation of the requirement that a medical witness who is available to testify must be produced at trial. The witness may
have to appear a total of three times, first, at a deposition, second, at a compulsory arbitration hearing
and third, at trial in the Common Pleas Court.
Videotape Rule 4017.1(g) recognizes this hardship by permitting use at trial of the videotape deposition of a medical witness even if he is available to appear. Rule 1809(b) similarly provides that on
a de novo appeal to the Common Pleas Court from a Health Care Arbitration Panel the deposition of
any medical witness offered during arbitration shall be admissible whether or not the witness is available at trial on the appeal.
In fact, these two Rules go beyond the medical witness and give the same privilege to any ‘‘other’’
expert witness.
To the contrary, subdivision (a)(5) is limited to medical witnesses.
The Committee was concerned about the effect of the inclusion of ‘‘other experts’’ in this Rule
which permits a deposition to be read at a trial in lieu of the appearance of a witness who is available
to appear.
The videotape situation is different. Here the jury or the court will see the witness and can observe
his demeanor. Although there may be a reduction in the size of the image and the reproduction may
not be perfect, it is a far cry from having someone read from a stenographic transcript the words of
an absent person.
The Health Care Services cases are also different. These are by definition medical malpractice
cases. Here the issues are basically medical and majority of expert witnesses will be medical witnesses. Sometimes there will be issues which will need a non-medical expert witness, but these issues
will necessarily be subordinate to the essential medical character of the trial. For example, an issue
might be the construction and operating efficiency of a piece of hospital equipment or the purity of
a drug which was administered.
It is obvious that Rule 4020 is different from Rules 4017.1 and 1809(b). This Rule covers every
kind of action at law or in equity. The types of experts and the nature of their testimony will be almost
unlimited. These experts will have no ‘‘personal’’ problems like the physician, whose problems have
been the justification for special treatment. The ‘‘other experts’’ may talk about real estate values,
actuarial formulas, exploding bottles, concrete construction, security values, fire alarm systems, defective steering assemblies, false signatures, urban planning, defective heating systems, ballistics and the
endless list of topics which can be the focus of expertise in litigation.
If these manifold experts do not appear on videotape, what special reason is there for the jury never
to see them, if they are available to appear at the trial?

Rule 1.1. Short Title and Citation.
 These Rules shall be known as the Pennsylvania Orphans' Court Rules, shall be referred to individually herein as ''Rule,'' and cited as ''Pa.O.C. Rule ______ .''

 Note: Rule 1.1 is substantively similar to former Rule 17.

Rule 1.2. Construction and Application of Rules.
 (a) The Rules adopted by the Supreme Court regulating the practice and procedure of the Orphans' Court Divisions of this Commonwealth and the local rules adopted by such courts shall be liberally construed to secure the just, timely and efficient determination of every action or proceeding to which they are applicable. The court at every stage of any action or proceeding may disregard any error or defect of procedure that does not affect the substantive rights of the parties in interest.

 (b) The principles of interpretation and related matters set forth in Pa.R.C.P. Nos. 102 through 153 inclusive, with the exception of Pa.R.C.P. No. 126, shall apply to these Rules.

 Note: Rule 1.2(a) is identical to former Rule 2.1. Rule 1.2(b) is new.

 Explanatory Comment: The Orphans' Court Division exercises equitable powers and applies equitable principles. Estate of Hahn, 369 A.2d 1290, 1291-92 (Pa. 1977); Estate of Freihofer, 174 A.2d 282, 284 (Pa. 1961).

 The question frequently arises as to the effect and use of the notes and explanatory comments which are issued with the Orphans' Court Rules. Notes and explanatory comments are not part of the Rules but they may be used in construing the Rules. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has stated in Laudenberger v. Port Authority of Allegheny County, 436 A.2d 147, 151 (Pa. 1981):

These explanatory notes have not been officially adopted or promulgated by this Court, nor do they constitute part of the rule. However, they indicate the spirit and motivation behind the drafting of the rule, and they serve as guidelines for understanding the purpose for which the rule was drafted.

 (e) All proposed local rules and proposed amendments to local rules shall be submitted in writing to the Supreme Court Orphans' Court Procedural Rules Committee (''Committee'') for review in advance of becoming effective. The submitting court shall not adopt the proposed local rule or proposed amendment to the local rule until the submitting court receives written notification from the Committee that the proposed local rule or the proposed amendment to the local rule is not inconsistent with these Rules.

 (f) After written notification is received from the Committee, the submitting court shall comply with all the following requirements:

 (1) The local rule shall be set forth in writing;

 (2) One certified paper copy of the local rule shall be filed with the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts;

 (3) Two certified paper copies of the local rule and a computer diskette or a CD-ROM that complies with requirements of 1 Pa. Code § 13.11(b), or an agreed-upon alternate format, containing the text of the local rule shall be distributed to the Legislative Reference Bureau for publication in the Pennsylvania Bulletin;

 (h) No case shall be dismissed nor request for relief granted or denied because of the failure to comply with a local rule. In any case of noncompliance with a local rule, the court shall advise the party of the specific provision at issue and provide a reasonable time for the party to comply with the local rule. Subsequent noncompliance may result in court-imposed sanctions.

 (i) The Committee may at any time recommend that the Supreme Court suspend, vacate, or require amendment of a local rule.

 Note: Rule 1.5 is new; but, the procedures for promulgating local rules are based upon former Rule 1.2 and have been modeled after those found in Pa.R.Crim.P. 105. The Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts maintains a web site containing the texts of local rules at http://www.pacourts.us/T/SpecialCourts/LocalRules.htm.

 Explanatory Comment: After the court has alerted the party to the local rule pursuant to subparagraph (h), the court may impose a sanction for subsequent noncompliance either on the individual party or counsel who has entered a written appearance on behalf of a party, but may not dismiss the petition, or grant or deny relief because of noncompliance with the local rule. Cf. Pa.R.Crim.P. 105 Comment.

Rule 1.6. Mediation by Agreement, Local Rule, or Court Order.
 All parties having an interest in a matter may participate by written agreement, or the court by local rule or order in a particular matter may provide for the parties to participate, in private mediation or in court-supervised mediation.

 Note: Rule 1.6 has no counterpart in former Orphans' Court Rules.

 Explanatory Comment: The confidentiality of mediation is provided by statute, See 42 Pa.C.S. § 5949.

Rule 1.7. Entry and Withdrawal of Counsel.

 (1) filing an entry of appearance with the clerk or the Register;

 (2) signing a legal paper that is filed with the clerk or the Register; or

 (3) as prescribed by local rule, which may include submitting an appearance slip to the court, entering counsel's information when a legal paper is filed, or signing a cover sheet.

 (b) Withdrawal. Counsel who has entered an appearance before the court as provided in subparagraph (a) shall not be permitted to withdraw without filing a petition to withdraw and obtaining the court's leave, unless co-counsel, if any, will continue representing the party or there is a simultaneous entry of appearance by other counsel that will not delay the litigation.

 Note: Rule 1.7 has no counterpart in former Orphans' Court Rules, but is based upon many local rules of similar import.

 Explanatory Comment: Admission pro hac vice in accordance with Pennsylvania Bar Admission Rule 301 shall proceed by request, the disposition and content of which shall conform to the requirements of Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure No. 1012.1.

Rule 1.8. Forms.
 (a) The forms approved by the Supreme Court for statewide practice and procedure before the Registers and courts shall be used exclusively by all Registers and clerks. Where a Supreme Court-approved form exists, no other form shall be allowed or required by local rule or practice.

 (b) The forms approved by the Supreme Court for statewide practice are set forth in an Appendix to these Rules. The forms may be revised and supplemented from time to time. The forms shall also be maintained for public access at the official website of the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts.

 (c) A court may require a legal paper to be accompanied by a cover sheet or checklist. A court that imposes such requirements must promulgate a local rule, numbered Local Rule 1.8(c), stating the requirements and setting forth the form of the cover sheet or checklist.

 Note: Rule 1.8 is substantively similar to former Rule 1.3, but with some modifications.

 Explanatory Comment: Rule 1.8 has been modified from former Rule 1.3 by now mandating the exclusive use of statewide forms promulgated by the Supreme Court. Previously, forms approved or mandated for use pursuant to local rule could be accepted by the local register and clerk so long as the local register and clerk also permitted and accepted forms promulgated by the Supreme Court. Now, if the Supreme Court has promulgated or approved a form for use before the register or clerk, then such form is the only one that may be used by the applicant or petitioner and is the only one that can be accepted by the local register or clerk. The mandatory statewide forms are set forth in the Appendix attached hereto. The current website for electronic access to the forms is found at www.pacourts.us/forms under the For-the-Public category. The forms posted on the website are capable of on-line completion.

 (b) As illustrated in the Model Accounts, Accounts shall conform to the following rules:

 (1) The dates of all receipts, disbursements and distributions, the sources of the receipts, and the persons to whom disbursements and distributions are made and the purpose thereof shall be stated. When a number of payments have been received from the same source or disbursed or distributed to the same recipient for the same purpose over a period of time, such receipts, disbursements or distributions need not be itemized, but may be stated in total amounts only, with beginning and ending dates within the period covered.

The verification of a personal representative's Account shall contain a statement that the Grant of Letters and the first complete advertisement thereof occurred more than four months before the filing of the Account, unless the personal representative has been directed by the court to file an Account prior to that time.

 (c) The Uniform Fiduciary Accounting Principles with accompanying commentaries and illustrations, recommended by the Committee on National Fiduciary Accounting Standards in collaboration with the National Center for State Courts, shall serve as an elaboration of the requirements of this Rule.

 (d) When a non-profit corporation incorporated for charitable purposes or a cemetery company is required to file an Account, such corporation or company may file its financial statements for its three most recent fiscal years in lieu of filing an Account in the form required by this Rule. Financial statements shall be verified to be true and correct by a representative of the non-profit corporation or cemetery company.

 (iii) a concise statement of the general purpose of the corporation or company; and

 (iv) a copy of the corporation's or company's charter or articles of incorporation and bylaws.

 Note: Rule 2.1 is substantively similar to former Rule 6.1 and Rule 12.15, except that certain subparagraphs have been reordered and Rule 12.15 and its Official Note have become subparagraph (d).

 Explanatory Comment: Piggy-backed Accounts and limited Accounts are permitted pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. §§ 762, 3501.2, and 7799.1.

Rule 2.2. Form; Assets Transferred by the Exercise of a Power of Appointment.
 Assets that are appointed pursuant to the exercise of a power of appointment shall be accounted for separately, and testamentary assets shall be segregated from appointive assets.

 Note: Rule 2.2 has been revised but remains substantively similar to subparagraph (d) of former Rule 6.1.

Rule 2.3. Form; Separate Accounts for Minors.
 Unless the court for cause shown directs otherwise, the estate of each minor or the custodial account of each minor shall be accounted for separately.

 Note: Rule 2.3 is substantively similar to former Rule 6.2, except that Rule 2.3 now also expressly encompasses the Account of a minor's custodial account.

Rule 2.4. Petition for Adjudication/Statement of Proposed Distribution; Virtual Representation.
 (a) A petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution shall be filed with the clerk at the time of filing an Account.

 (b) In addition to other information required by the form, the petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution shall set forth the name of each interested party (whether sui juris or not) who is not receiving notice of the filing of the Account and the filing of the petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution because another individual or entity is proposed to represent such interested party pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. § 751(6) or §§ 7721—7726, and shall set forth additional facts as to the following:

 (1) a statement of the interested party's interest in the property; and

 (2) for representation being proposed pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. § 751(6),

 (i) a statement that the interested party is not sui juris or is unborn, unknown or unascertained; and

 (ii) one of the following:

 (A) a statement that the proposed representative has an interest in the property similar to that of the interested party who is not sui juris or is unborn, unknown or unascertained; or

 (B) a statement that the proposed representative is the sui juris living ancestor of the interested party who is not sui juris or is unborn, unknown or unascertained and that such living sui juris ancestor has an interest in the property that is not adverse to that of the interested party who is not sui juris or is unborn, unknown or unascertained; and

 (3) for representation in trust matters being proposed pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. §§ 7721—7726,

 (i) an explanation about how the interested party's interest in the property can be adequately represented by the proposed representative pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. § 7723,

 (ii) a statement that with respect to the matter at issue there is no conflict of interest between the proposed representative and the interested party to be represented that will or might affect the impartiality of the proposed representative (except as provided pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. § 7723(7)); and

 (iii) one of the following:

 (A) either a statement that the proposed representative has been informed of the right to decline such representation pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. § 7725 within the time period set forth therein and has failed to inform the trustee in writing that he or she declines to be the proposed representative; or

 (B) that the proposed representative's signed consent to serve is attached as an exhibit to the petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution.

 (c) The petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution shall be accompanied by such legal paper as is required by the form.

 (d) At least one of the accountants stating the Account shall sign and verify the petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution in accordance with Rules 3.12 and 3.13.

 (e) Counsel for the accountant shall sign the petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution in accordance with and pursuant to Rule 3.12.

 Note: Although substantially modified, Rule 2.4 is derived from former Rule 6.9. One modification is to require averments for virtual representation under 20 Pa.C.S. § 751(6) generally and representation in ''trust matters'' pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. § 7721 et seq. Another substantial modification is the addition of subparagraph (e) that requires counsel to sign the petition for adjudication/statement of distribution attesting that the submitted petition for adjudication/statement of distribution accurately replicates the Model Form and subjects counsel to rules and sanctions as provided in Pa.R.C.P. Nos. 1023.1 through 1023.4. (See Rule 3.12.)

 Explanatory Comment: The Supreme Court has adopted form petitions for adjudication/statements of proposed distribution of a decedent's estate, trust, guardian of an incapacitated person's estate, guardian of a minor's estate, and the estate of a principal stated by an agent under a power of attorney. These form petitions for adjudication/statements of proposed distribution are the exclusive forms for adjudicating an Account, and consequently, the local court and clerk must accept these statewide forms and may not accept or allow any other forms previously permitted under local rules. The exclusive statewide form petitions for adjudication/statements of proposed distribution appear in the Appendix and are available electronically at www.pacourts.us/forms under the For-the-Public category.

 Cover sheets or checklists may be required by local rule as permitted by Rule 1.8(c).

Rule 2.5. Notice of Account Filing.
 (a) No Account shall be confirmed or statement of proposed distribution approved unless the accountant has given written notice of the filing of the Account as provided in subparagraph (d) of this Rule to the following, as applicable:

 (1) every unpaid claimant who has given written notice of his or her claim to the accountant or who has performed any action that is the equivalent of giving written notice as provided in 20 Pa.C.S. §§ 3384 or 7755;

 (2) any other individual or entity with an asserted claim known to the accountant that is not shown in either the Account or the petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution as being either paid in full or to be paid in full;

 (3) any other individual or entity known to the accountant to have or claim an interest in the estate or trust as a beneficiary, heir, or next of kin, except for those legatees or claimants whose legacies or claims have been satisfied in full as reflected in the Account or will be satisfied in full as proposed in the petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution; and

 (4) For an Account where a charitable interest is involved, refer to Rule 4.4.

 (b) Notice to an individual or entity shall be given in accordance with Rule 4.2; provided, however, that if the individual or entity is represented by counsel who has entered his or her appearance in accordance with Rule 1.7(a), notice shall be given to counsel and the individual or entity.

 (c) If the proposed distribution is to an estate or trust and a charity is a ''qualified beneficiary,'' as defined in 20 Pa.C.S. § 7703, of that recipient estate or trust, then notice shall be given to the Attorney General on behalf of the charitable beneficiary. If the proposed distribution is to an estate or trust and any one of the accountants stating the Account is a personal representative or a trustee of the recipient estate or trust, then notice shall also be given to the beneficiaries of the estate or trust, to the extent known.

 (d) Written notice, as provided in subparagraph (a) of this Rule, shall be mailed at least 20 days prior to the audit in those counties having a separate Orphans' Court Division or 20 days prior to the date by which objections must be filed in all other counties, and the written notice shall state the date of the audit or the date by which objections must be filed, and the time and place of the audit, if one is to be held, to the extent then known. If an audit is to be held and the time and place of the audit is not known at the time the notice is mailed, the notice shall state that the time and place of the audit will be provided upon request. A copy of the Account, petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution, and any legal paper filed therewith shall be sent with the notice, unless the recipient of the notice is a trust beneficiary who is not a ''qualified beneficiary'' as defined in 20 Pa.C.S. § 7703, or unless the court orders otherwise in a particular matter.

 (e) If the audit of an Account is continued or the date for filing written objections is extended, additional notice shall be mailed at least 20 days prior to the date of the continued audit or the new date for filing written objections to all of those who initially received notice of the Account's filing. The additional notice shall state the date of the continued audit or the date by which objections must be filed, and the time and place of the continued audit, if one is to be held, to the extent then known. If the time and place of the continued audit is not known at the time the additional notice is mailed, the additional notice shall state that the time and place of the continued audit will be provided upon request.

 (f) All notices and additional notices shall be sent by first-class United States mail, postage prepaid. Service by mail is complete upon mailing.

 (g) A certificate of service and a copy of the notice shall be appended to the petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution or filed with the clerk prior to the audit or continued audit date, in those counties having a separate Orphans' Court Division, or by the date when objections must be filed in all other counties.

 (h) The notice shall contain the information provided in subparagraphs (1), (2), and (3), as applicable, and, in all cases, shall contain a statement as provided in subparagraph (4):

 (1) the accountant's position on any known dispute or interpretation question, together with a copy of any instrument or material parts thereof containing any provision which forms the basis of the dispute or question;

 (2) the accountant's understanding of the nature of each contested or unpaid claim, a detailed explanation that specifically identifies the claim, whether the claim is admitted or contested, and if admitted, why the claim is not being paid in full;

 (3) if the Account and petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution is not sent with the notice pursuant to subparagraph (d) of this Rule, the notice shall state the amount of all compensation paid or payable to the accountant, all attorneys' fees paid or payable, and that copies of the Account and petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution are available upon request; and

 (4) that any recipient of the notice who objects to any transaction shown in the Account, any interpretation or position taken by the accountant, or to any payment, failure to pay, distribution proposed, or any other aspect of the petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution must file written objections in accordance with Rule 2.7 with the clerk on or before the audit date in those counties holding an audit and by a specified date in all other counties, and if there is no such objection, then no action need be taken as such recipient will be deemed to have approved the Account, as stated, and agreed with the accountant's position on any dispute or question as set forth in the petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution, if any, and with the accountant's proposed disbursements and distribution.

 Note: Although substantially modified, Rule 2.5 is derived from former Rule 6.3.

 Explanatory Comment: Pursuant to the cross-references to 20 Pa.C.S. §§ 3384 and 7755, notice of the claim given to accountant's counsel of record is notice to the accountant. See 20 Pa.C.S. § 3384(b)(4). If the court is inclined not to agree with accountant's position, interpretation or proposed disbursements and distribution, best practice would be for the court to direct the accountant to notify the interested parties of the court's position and what additional action must be taken by any interested party who objects to the court's position.

Rule 2.6. Filing with the Clerk.
 All Accounts shall be filed with the clerk.

 Note: Rule 2.6 is derived from what was formerly Rule 6.6. Former Rule 6.4 regarding the time for filing the first Account of the personal representative has been deleted as it is codified in 20 Pa.C.S. § 3501.1.

Rule 2.7. Objections to Accounts or Petitions for Adjudication/Statements of Proposed Distribution.
 (a) Objections to an Account and/or a petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution shall be filed with the clerk on or before the time and date of the audit in those counties holding an audit, and by a specified date in all other counties, with a copy sent by first-class United States mail, postage prepaid, to the accountant or the accountant's counsel, if represented, and to each interested party and claimant who received the notice pursuant to Rule 2.5, to the extent known.

 (b) Objections shall be in writing, with consecutively numbered paragraphs, signed by counsel, or if not represented by counsel, then by all the objectors in accordance with Rule 3.12. Objections shall be verified by at least one of the objectors in accordance with Rule 3.13.

 (c) Each objection shall:

 (1) be specific as to description and amount;

 (2) raise one issue of law or fact, but if there are several objections relating to the same issue, all such objections shall be included in the same paragraph as subparts; and

 (3) briefly set forth the reason or reasons in support thereof.

 (d) The court may extend the time for filing objections.

 Note: Although substantially modified, Rule 2.7 is derived from former Rule 6.10.

 Explanatory Comment: If the notice received by the objector has a service list appended to it setting forth the name and address of each interested party who received the notice under Rule 2.5, the objector must mail his or her objections to every name and address appearing on the service list.

Rule 2.8. Pleadings Allowed After Objections are Filed.
 (a) Answers to objections, preliminary objections to objections, and answers to preliminary objections are permitted, but a party does not waive any rights by failing to file any of the foregoing. If an answer to objections is filed, no responsive pleading to the answer is permitted.

 (b) Preliminary objections to objections shall be limited to lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter and lack of standing.

 (c) If filed, answers to objections, preliminary objections to objections, and answers to preliminary objections must be filed within 20 days after service of the applicable preceding pleading, with a copy served upon the accountant, if applicable, and to each interested party and claimant who received the notice pursuant to Rule 2.5, or to his or her counsel, if represented.

 (d) The court may summarily decide preliminary objections to objections and may do so prior to the filing of an answer to the preliminary objections.

 Note: Rule 2.8 has no counterpart in former Orphans' Court Rules.

 Explanatory Comment: Preliminary objections to objections are limited in the grounds that may be raised. Insufficient specificity, failure to conform to law, and the inclusion of scandalous or impertinent matter, inter alia, are not properly raised as preliminary objections to objections. (Cf. Rule 3.9 and Pa.R.C.P. No. 1028).

Rule 2.9. Confirmation of Accounts; Awards.
 (a) An Account shall be confirmed or petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution approved when an adjudication or a decree of distribution is issued by the court and docketed by the clerk, expressly confirming the Account or approving the petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution and specifying, or indicating by reference to the petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution, the names of those to whom the balance available for distribution is awarded and the amount or share awarded to each.

 (b) An adjudication confirming an Account discharges the fiduciaries as to those transactions set forth in the Account.

 (c) The practice related to Schedules of Distribution shall be prescribed by local rule.

 Note: Rule 2.9 is substantively similar to former Rule 6.11(a). Former Rule 6.11(b) has been deleted.

Rule 2.10. Foreign Heirs and Unknown Dis- tributees.
 (a) If it appears that the decedent may have heirs in a foreign country but their location, existence or identity is unknown, the accountant or his or her counsel shall notify the consulate of the country, prior to audit, of the facts indicating that the decedent may have had heirs in that country.

 (b) Whenever the existence, identity or whereabouts of a distributee is unknown, or it appears that a distributee may not have the actual benefit, use, enjoyment or control of the money or other property if awarded to him or her, or the court is requested to withhold distribution or to make an award other than to the distributee or his or her nominee, the accountant or his or her counsel shall submit to the court or auditor, as the case may be, a written report outlining the investigation made and the facts relevant thereto. The report shall be in such form and may be filed at such place and time as shall be prescribed by local rule or order of the court.

 Note: With only minor modifications, Rule 2.10 is substantively similar to former Rules 13.2 and 13.3. Former Rule 13.1 has been deleted.

Rule 2.11. Appointment of Official Examiners.
 The court, by local rule or order in a particular matter, may appoint an official examiner who shall examine the assets held by or the transactions of any fiduciary.

 Note: Rule 2.11 is substantively identical to former Rule 9.1. The appointment and conduct of Auditors and Masters is provided for in Chapter IX.

3.5.	Mode of Proceeding on Petition.
Rule 3.1. Petitions Generally.
 Matters may be raised before the court by written petition filed with the clerk in conformity with these Rules. Petitions for adjudication/statements of proposed distribution shall be governed by Chapter II.

 Note: Rule 3.1 has no counterpart in former Orphans' Court Rules.

 Explanatory Comment: The filing of an Account provides the procedure for raising questions related to the administration or distribution of an estate or trust, including a guardianship or minor's estate as well as a decedent's estate. Application to the Orphans' Court Division may also be commenced by a petition that is verified or attested by an affidavit. See 20 Pa.C.S. §§ 761, 762.

Rule 3.2. Headings; Captions.
 Pleadings shall include the docket number, if one has been assigned to the matter by the clerk or Register, and shall include a heading identifying the type of pleading filed, and in the case of a petition, identifying the nature of the relief requested therein. In those counties having a separate Orphans' Court Division, pleadings shall be captioned ''Court of Common Pleas of ______ County, Orphans' Court Division''.

 Note: Rule 3.2 has no counterpart in former Orphans' Court Rules, but is derived from Pa.R.C.P. No. 1018.

Rule 3.3. Contents of All Pleadings; General and Specific Averments.
 The following rules shall apply to all pleadings:

 (a) Every pleading shall be divided into consecutively numbered paragraphs. Each paragraph shall contain as far as practicable only one material allegation.

 (b) The material facts on which a cause of action or defense is based shall be stated in a concise and summary form.

 (c) Averments of fraud or mistake shall be averred with particularity. Malice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of mind may be averred generally.

 (d) In pleading the performance or occurrence of conditions precedent, it is sufficient to aver generally that all conditions precedent have been performed or have occurred. A denial of such performance or occurrence shall be made specifically and with particularity.

 (e) In pleading an official document or official act, it is sufficient to identify it by reference and aver that the document was issued or the act done in compliance with law.

 (f) In pleading a judgment, order or decision of a domestic or foreign court, judicial or administrative tribunal, or board, commission or officer, it is sufficient to aver the judgment, order or decision without setting forth matter showing jurisdiction to render it.

 (g) Averments of time and place shall be specifically stated.

 (h) Any part of a pleading may be incorporated by reference in another part of the same pleading or in another pleading in the same action. A party may incorporate by reference any matter of record in any state or federal court of record whose records are within the county in which the action is pending, or any matter which is recorded or transcribed verbatim in the office of the prothonotary, clerk of any court of record, recorder of deeds or Register of such county.

 (i) When any claim or defense is based upon an agreement, the pleading shall state specifically if the agreement is oral or written.

 (j) When any claim or defense is based upon a writing, the pleading shall have attached to it a copy of the writing, or the material part thereof, but if the writing or copy is not accessible to the pleader, it is sufficient so to state, identifying the reason therefor, and setting forth the substance of the writing.

 Note: Rule 3.3 has no counterpart in former Orphans' Court Rules, but is derived from Pa.R.C.P. No. 206.1(c) and Pa.R.C.P. No. 1019.

Rule 3.4. Form of Petition; Exhibits; Consents; Signing and Verification.
 (a) In addition to the requirements of Rules 3.2 and 3.3, a petition shall set forth:

 (1) a title indicating briefly the purpose of the petition;

 (2) a concise statement of the facts relied upon to establish the court's jurisdiction and to justify the relief requested;

 (3) the questions of law with respect to the petition and the relief requested;

 (4) if the trust includes a charitable interest for which notice is required under Rule 4.4, whether the Office of the Attorney General has been given notice, whether the Office of the Attorney General has issued a statement of no objection to the petition, or the reason for failing to give the Office of the Attorney General notice;

 (5) the names and addresses of every interested party who has an interest in the matter that is the subject of the petition;

 (6) the name of any individual who is an interested party but is not sui juris, along with the following information:

 (i) the name and address of the guardian, agent under power of attorney, or another individual being proposed to represent such individual, if any;

 (ii) if such individual is a minor and no guardian has been appointed for such minor's estate, the minor's age, the names and addresses of his or her parents, and the individual with whom he or she resides or the facility at which he or she resides; and

 (iii) if the non-sui juris individual is proposed to be represented in the matter at issue by another individual or entity pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. §§ 751(6) or 7721—7726, then subparagraph (7) of this Rule shall also apply;

 (7) the name of each interested party (whether sui juris or not) who is not receiving notice of the filing of the petition because another individual or entity is proposed to represent such interested party pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. §§ 751(6) or 7721—7726, and shall set forth additional facts as to the following:

 (i) a statement of the interested party's interest in the property; and

 (ii) for representation being proposed pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. § 751(6),

 (A) a statement that the interested party is not sui juris or is unborn, unknown or unascertained; and

 (II) a statement that the proposed representative is the sui juris living ancestor of the interested party who is not sui juris or is unborn, unknown or unascertained and that such living sui juris ancestor has an interest in the property that is not adverse to that of the interested party who is not sui juris or is unborn, unknown or unascertained; and

 (iii) for representation in trust matters being proposed pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. §§ 7721—7726,

 (C) one of the following:

 (I) either a statement that the proposed representative has been informed of the right to decline such representation pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. § 7725 within the time period set forth therein and has failed to inform the trustee in writing that he or she declines to be the proposed representative; or

 (II) that the proposed representative's signed consent to serve is attached as an exhibit to such petition; and

 (8) a prayer for the relief desired.

 (b) A proposed form of decree bearing the caption of the case and setting forth the relief requested in the prayer of the petition shall be attached to the front of the petition. In the case of a petition requiring a citation under Rule 3.5(a), a proposed form of preliminary decree for the issuance of the citation to the interested parties, subject to subparagraph (a)(7) of this Rule, shall also be attached to the front of the petition.

 (c) Petitioner shall attach to the petition such exhibits, consents or approvals as may be required by these Rules, applicable statute, or local rule. If the petitioner is unable to attach any necessary exhibit, consent or approval, the petition shall so state and identify the reason therefor.

 (d) The petition shall be verified by at least one of the petitioners in accordance with Rule 3.13 and signed by counsel, or if not represented by counsel, then signed by all the petitioners in accordance with Rule 3.12.

 Note: Rule 3.4 is based upon former Rule 3.3 and Rule 3.4, but has been modified to require averments for virtual representation under 20 Pa.C.S. § 751(6) generally and representation in ''trust matters'' pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. § 7721 et seq. Another modification is the addition of subparagraph (d) that requires petitioner's counsel to sign the petition, or all of the petitioners to sign the petition, if unrepresented, thereby subjecting these signatories to rules and sanctions as provided in Pa.R.C.P. Nos. 1023.1 through 1023.4. (See Rule 3.12.)

Rule 3.5. Mode of Proceeding on Petition.
 (a) Citation Practice.

 (1) When personal jurisdiction is required and has not previously been obtained or conferred by statute, or when a citation is otherwise required by statute, the petition shall include a preliminary decree for the issuance of a citation to those interested parties for whom a citation is necessary to show cause why the relief requested in the petition should not be granted.

 (2) The citation to obtain personal jurisdiction and a copy of the petition shall be served upon each cited party at least 20 days before the date when a responsive pleading is due, in the same manner as service of original process under Pa.R.C.P. Nos. 402 through 404, Pa.R.C.P. No. 420, and Pa.R.C.P. Nos. 422 through 424 inclusive. If service cannot be made under the foregoing rules, the court may order service by publication in accordance with Pa.R.C.P. No. 430. Service of a citation as original process shall not be permitted by electronic means, unless agreed to by the respondent.

 (3) If the citation is not being issued in order to obtain personal jurisdiction over an interested party, the petition and the citation may be served by first-class United States mail, postage prepaid, at least 20 days before the date when a responsive pleading is due.

 (4) If the citation and petition are not served at least 20 days before the date when a responsive pleading is due, the court, upon request, may authorize the reissuance of the citation.

 (5) Once the citation to obtain personal jurisdiction has been served upon the cited party by original process in accordance with subparagraph (a)(2), then notice of a rescheduled return date or any other rescheduled date for filing a responsive pleading or appearing before the court may be served by first-class United States mail, postage prepaid, at least 20 days before such rescheduled date.

 (6) If an interested party (whether sui juris or not) is represented by another, the citation and petition shall be served upon the interested party's representative(s) pursuant to Rule 4.2.

 (7) Proof of service of the citation shall be filed with the clerk on or before the date when a responsive pleading is due.

 (8) Each interested party identified in the citation, or such interested party's representative identified in the citation, may file a responsive pleading in accordance with these Rules on or before the date provided in the citation.

 (b) Notice Practice.

 (1) In all cases where personal jurisdiction is not required or has been previously obtained, or conferred by statute, the petitioner shall, either in advance of filing or contemporaneously therewith, provide a copy of the petition to the interested parties identified in the petition. The petition shall have affixed to its first page a notice to plead that shall be substantially in the following form:

To: ______
You are hereby notified to file a written response to the (name of pleading) within twenty (20) days from the date of notice or on or before the date when the pleading is to be filed, whichever is later, or the court may deem that you have no objection to the relief requested therein and may grant such relief without further notice to you.
 (2) A certificate of service, listing the names and addresses of those individuals and entities receiving notice of the filing of the petition, shall be appended to, or filed contemporaneously with, the petition.

 (3) If an interested party (whether sui juris or not) is not receiving notice of the filing of the petition because he or she is represented by another, a copy of the petition shall be sent in accordance with subparagraph (b)(1) to the interested party's representative pursuant to Rule 4.2.

 (c) Consents/Statements of No Objection; Joinders.

 No citation or notice to plead is required where all individuals and/or entities identified in the petition as interested parties (or any representative thereof) satisfy one of the following:

 (1) they are named petitioners in the petition;

 (2) they filed joinders to the petition; or

 (3) they signed a document, that is attached to the petition as an exhibit, consenting to or stating that they have no objection to the relief requested in the petition.

 Note: Subparagraphs (a) and (b) of Rule 3.5 are derived from former Rule 3.5. The final sentence of subparagraph (a)(2) is identical to former Rule 3.7(h)(1); it merely has been relocated to this section. Subparagraphs (c) and (d) of this Rule have no counterpart in former Orphans' Court Rules.

 Explanatory Comment: Personal jurisdiction is conferred by statute in certain circumstances. See e.g., 20 Pa.C.S. § 7712. A sheriff does not need to serve the citation issued by the clerk; instead, any adult person may serve the citation and file the proof of service in accordance with subparagraph (a)(7) of this Rule 3.5. See 20 Pa.C.S. § 765. If a citation is not being issued with the petition, then the petition must be endorsed with a notice to plead. See Rule 3.5(b) and Pa.R.C.P. No. 1026. The court, by local rule or by order in a particular matter, may establish a procedure for rules to show cause as provided in Pa.R.C.P. No. 206.4 et seq.

Part B. Responsive Pleadings
Rule

3.6.	Pleadings Allowed After Petition.
3.7.	Time for Filing and Service of Responsive Pleadings.
3.8.	Headings of Responsive Pleadings.
3.9.	Preliminary Objections.
3.10.	Denials; Effect of Failure to Deny.
3.11.	Answer with New Matter.
Rule 3.6. Pleadings Allowed After Petition.
 Pleadings allowed after the filing of a petition are limited to:

 (a) an answer that can include new matter;

 (b) a reply, if an answer contains new matter;

 (c) preliminary objections to the petition as permitted by Rule 3.9;

 (d) an answer to preliminary objections; and

 (e) a petition to join one or more persons as parties to the proceeding and an answer thereto.

 Note: Rule 3.6 has no counterpart in former Orphans' Court Rules, but is based, in part, on Pa.R.C.P. No. 1017.

 Explanatory Comment: Any interested party may file a new petition bringing a new issue or dispute before the court or seeking alternative relief in the same trust or estate. Motions are permitted in Orphans' Court Division, and this Rule 3.6 does not prohibit or limit motions practice.

Rule 3.7. Time for Filing and Service of Responsive Pleadings.
 (a) Unless the court orders otherwise, each interested party identified in the petition, or such interested party's representative identified in the petition, may file a responsive pleading in accordance with these Rules within 20 days of the date of notice or the date of the filing, whichever is later. A party residing outside of the United States shall have 60 days, rather than 20 days, within which to file a responsive pleading to the citation or the petition initiating the proceeding.

 (b) A copy of the responsive pleading shall be sent to the petitioner or his or her counsel, if represented, and all interested parties identified in the petition or counsel representing an interested party if so identified in the petition or in a subsequent pleading. A certificate of service, listing the names and addresses of those individuals and entities receiving a copy of the responsive pleading shall be appended to, or filed contemporaneously with, the responsive pleading.

 (c) A notice to plead in substantially the form provided in Rule 3.5(b)(1) shall be affixed to the first page of an answer that contains new matter and to the first page of preliminary objections which aver a fact that is not contained in the petition.

 (d) Regardless of the residency of any interested party, each subsequent pleading shall be filed within 20 days after service of the preceding pleading, but no pleading need be filed unless the preceding pleading included a notice to plead that complies with the requirements of Rule 3.5(b)(1).

 Note: Rule 3.7 is new, but is derived from Pa.R.C.P. No. 1026.

 Explanatory Comment: The court, by local rule, may establish procedures for the disposition of matters after the pleadings are closed.

Rule 3.8. Headings of Responsive Pleadings.
 All responsive pleadings shall contain a heading identifying the name of the pleading to which it is responding.

 Note: Rule 3.8 has no counterpart in former Orphans' Court Rules.

Rule 3.9. Preliminary Objections.
 (a) General. Preliminary objections may be filed to any petition by any interested party or the interested party's representative.

 (b) Grounds for Preliminary Objections. Preliminary objections filed to any petition under the Rules of Chapter III are limited to the following grounds:

 (1) lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action or lack of jurisdiction over the person, improper venue, or improper form of service;

 (2) failure of a pleading to conform to law or rule of court or inclusion of scandalous or impertinent matter;

 (3) insufficient specificity in a pleading;

 (4) legal insufficiency of a pleading (demurrer);

 (5) lack of standing or lack of capacity to sue, nonjoinder of a necessary party, or misjoinder of a cause of action; and

 (6) pendency of a prior action or agreement for alternative dispute resolution.

 (c) Form. All preliminary objections shall be raised at one time in one pleading, shall state specifically the grounds relied upon, and may be inconsistent.

 (d) Disposition of Preliminary Objections.

 (1) A party may file an amended pleading, without consent of any other party and without leave of court, within 20 days after service of the preliminary objections. If a party files an amended pleading, the preliminary objections to the original pleading shall be deemed moot.

 (2) In all other instances, the court shall determine promptly all preliminary objections. If an issue of fact is raised, the court shall consider evidence by deposition or otherwise.

 (e) Pleadings Allowed Subsequent to the Disposition of Preliminary Objections.

 (1) If the preliminary objections are overruled, the party who filed the preliminary objections shall have the right to file an answer within 20 days after entry of the order overruling the preliminary objections or within such other time as the court shall direct.

 (2) If the filing of an amended petition or a new petition is allowed or required, it shall be filed within 20 days after entry of the order concerning such amended or new petition or within such other time as the court shall direct.

 (3) New preliminary objections may be filed to any amended or new petition in accordance with this Rule.

 Note: Rule 3.9 has no counterpart in former Orphans' Court Rules, but is derived from Pa.R.C.P. No. 1028.

 Explanatory Comment: Preliminary objections raising an issue under subparagraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(4), and in some instances (b)(1), may be determined from the facts of record so that further evidence is not required. In such situations, the court may summarily decide preliminary objections prior to the filing of an answer.

 Preliminary objections raising an issue under subparagraphs (b)(5) and (b)(6), and in some instances (b)(1), cannot be determined from the facts of record. In such situations, if the preliminary objections are not endorsed with a notice to plead in the form required by Rule 3.5(b)(1), no reply will be required under Rule 3.10, and the preliminary objections will be overruled.

 Pleadings may be amended only in accordance with subparagraphs (d)(1), (e)(2) or Rule 3.14.

 For preliminary objections to Objections to an Account, petition for adjudication/statement of proposed distribution or a notice, cf. Rule 2.8(b) for a more limited scope of permitted preliminary objections.

Rule 3.10. Denials; Effect of Failure to Deny.
 (a) A responsive pleading shall admit or deny each averment of fact in the preceding pleading or any part thereof. Admissions and denials in a responsive pleading shall refer specifically to the paragraph in which the averment admitted or denied is set forth. A party denying only a part of an averment shall specify so much of it as is admitted and shall deny the remainder.

 (b) Averments in a pleading to which a responsive pleading is required are admitted when not denied specifically or by necessary implication. A general denial or a demand for proof, except as provided by subparagraph (c) of this Rule, shall have the effect of an admission.

 (c) A statement by a party that after reasonable investigation the party is without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of an averment shall have the effect of a denial.

 (d) Averments in a pleading to which no responsive pleading is required shall be deemed to be denied.

 (e) A responsive pleading shall be signed by counsel, or if not represented by counsel, then by all the respondents in accordance with Rule 3.12. A responsive pleading that admits or denies any averment of fact shall be verified by at least one of the respondents in accordance with Rule 3.13.

 Note: Rule 3.10 has no counterpart in former Orphans' Court Rules, but is derived from Pa.R.C.P. No. 1029.

 Explanatory Comment: Reliance on subparagraph (c) does not excuse a failure to admit or deny a factual allegation when it is clear that the respondent must know whether a particular allegation is true or false. Cf. Cercone v. Cercone, 386 A.2d 1, 4 (Pa. Super. 1978).

Rule 3.11. Answer with New Matter.
 All applicable affirmative defenses shall be pleaded in the answer under the heading ''New Matter.'' A party may set forth as new matter any other material facts that are not merely denials of the averments of the preceding pleading.

 Note: Rule 3.11 has no counterpart in former Orphans' Court Rules, but is derived from Pa.R.C.P. No. 1030.

Part C. Pleadings in General
Rule

3.12.	Signing.
3.13.	Verification.
3.14.	Amendment.
3.15.	Pleading More Than One Cause of Action; Alternative Pleadings.
Rule 3.12. Signing.
 (a) Counsel who has entered an appearance for a party pursuant to Rule 1.7(a) shall sign every pleading and any brief or memorandum of law and shall include counsel's name and address. A party not represented by any counsel of record shall sign every pleading and any brief or memorandum of law and shall include the party's name, an address where legal paper may be served, and a telephone number.

 (b) If the legal paper includes a facsimile telephone number and/or email address, that party or his or her counsel agrees to accept service of legal paper by transmission of a facsimile copy or by electronic transmission.

 (c) By signing a legal paper, the party and counsel are subject to Pa.R.C.P. Nos. 1023.1 through 1023.4. The court has authority to impose sanctions and grant relief in accordance with Pa.R.C.P. No. 1023.4.

 Note: Rule 3.12 has no counterpart in former Orphans' Court Rules, but subparagraphs (a) and (b) are derived from Pa.R.C.P. No. 1025. Rule 3.12(c) is based upon Pa.R.C.P. No. 1023.1 et seq.

 Explanatory Comment: The Explanatory Comments appearing after Pa.R.C.P. Nos. 1023.1 and 1023.4 are fully incorporated by reference herein.

Rule 3.13. Verification.
 (a) Every pleading shall be verified, averring as true every fact not appearing of record in the action or containing a denial of fact based upon the signer's personal knowledge or information and belief. A pleading may be verified upon personal knowledge as to a part and upon information and belief as to the remainder. The signer need not aver the source of the information or expectation of ability to prove the averment or denial at the trial.

 (b) If a pleading contains averments that are inconsistent in fact, the verification shall state that the signer has been unable after reasonable investigation to ascertain which of the inconsistent averments, specifying them, are true but that the signer has knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief that one of them is true.

 (c) The verification shall be made by one or more of the parties filing the pleading unless all the parties (1) lack sufficient knowledge or information, or (2) are outside the jurisdiction of the court and the verification of none of them can be obtained within the time allowed for filing the pleading. In such cases, the verification may be made by any person having sufficient knowledge or information and belief and shall set forth the source of the person's information as to matters not stated upon his or her own knowledge and the reason why the verification is not made by a party.

 Note: Rule 3.13 has no counterpart in former Orphans' Court Rules, but is derived from Pa.R.C.P. No. 1024.

Rule 3.14. Amendment.
 A party may amend a pleading pursuant to Rule 3.9(d)(1), or at any other time, either by written consent of all other parties filed with the clerk or by leave of court. The amended pleading may aver transactions or occurrences that have happened before or after the filing of the original pleading. An amendment may be made to conform the pleading to the evidence offered or admitted.

 Note: Rule 3.14 has no counterpart in former Orphans' Court Rules, but is derived from Pa.R.C.P. No. 1033.

 Explanatory Comment: Rule 3.9(d)(1) provides for amending a pleading after the filing of preliminary objections.

Rule 3.15. Pleading More Than One Cause of Action; Alternative Pleadings.
 (a) More than one cause of action may be stated in a pleading. Each cause of action shall be stated in a separate count, preceded by a heading, and the count shall name the parties to that cause of action and shall contain a separate request for relief.

 (b) Causes of action and defenses may be pleaded in the alternative.

 Note: Rule 3.15 has no counterpart in former Orphans' Court Rules, but is derived from Pa.R.C.P. No. 1020.

CHAPTER IV. FORMAT AND SERVICE OF LEGAL PAPER BY PARTIES AND COURT; ELECTRONIC FILING
Rule

4.1.	Format of All Legal Paper.
4.2.	Citation or Notice to Individuals and Entities.
4.3.	Service of Legal Paper Other than Citations or Notices.
4.4.	Charities—Notice to the Attorney General.
4.5.	Service of Legal Paper by Court and Clerk.
4.6.	Notice of the Date of Entry of an Adjudication or Court Order on the Docket.
4.7.	Electronic Filing.
Rule 4.1. Format of All Legal Paper.
 All legal paper filed with the clerk must conform to the following requirements:

 (a) The document shall be on 8 1/2 inch by 11 inch paper.

 (b) The document shall be prepared on white paper (except for dividers and similar sheets) of good quality.

 (c) The text must be double spaced, but quotations more than two lines long may be indented and single-spaced. Margins must be at least one inch on all four sides.

 (d) The lettering shall be clear and legible and no smaller than point 12. The lettering shall be on only one side of a page, except that exhibits and similar supporting documents may be double-sided.

 Note: Rule 4.1 has no counterpart in former Orphans' Court Rules, but is derived from Pa.R.C.P. No. 204.1.

 Explanatory Comment: Rule 4.1 governing the format of legal paper is modeled after Pa.R.C.P. No. 204.1 and thus is substantively identical to Pa.R.A.P. No. 124(a) and Pa.R.Crim.P. 575(C). See Explanatory Comment to Pa.R.C.P. No. 204.1. The goal is to foster uniformity in the formatting of legal paper filed in all judicial tribunals, regardless of the level of court or division of court; this uniformity, in turn, will promote the objective of the unified judicial system under the Constitution of 1968 and facilitate the statewide practice of law.

Rule 4.2. Citation or Notice to Individuals and Entities.
 (a) To individuals. Whenever a citation under Rule 3.5(a) is to be served or notice under Rule 2.5 or Rule 3.5(b) is to be given to an individual:

 (1) If the individual is sui juris, or if the individual has reached the age of 18 and is believed to be incapacitated (under the provisions of Chapter 55 of Title 20), but for whom no guardian is known to have been appointed by a Pennsylvania court or by the court of any other jurisdiction (including a guardian ad litem with respect to the matter at issue), then such notice or citation shall be provided:

 (i) to the individual; or

 (ii) if the individual will be represented with respect to the matter at issue by a representative under the provisions of 20 Pa.C.S. §§ 7721—7726, then such notice or citation may instead be provided to such representative, including notice as required by 20 Pa.C.S. § 7725 that each such representative may decline to act as a representative for the sui juris individual.

 (2) If the individual is not sui juris, or is unborn, unknown or unascertained, then such notice or citation shall be provided to such individual's representative with respect to the matter at issue under the provisions of 20 Pa.C.S. §§ 751(6) or 7721—7726, including notice required by 20 Pa.C.S. § 7725 that each such representative may decline to act as a representative for the individual; provided, however, that if a guardian or trustee ad litem has been appointed to represent such individual by the court having jurisdiction over the matter at issue, then such notice or citation shall also be provided to the guardian or trustee ad litem.

 (b) To entities. Whenever a citation under Rule 3.5(a) is to be served or notice under Rule 2.5 or Rule 3.5(b) is to be given to an entity, then such citation or notice shall be provided:

 (1) to the entity through the entity's duly authorized representative; or

 (2) if the entity will be represented with respect to the matter at issue by a representative under the provisions of 20 Pa.C.S. §§ 7721—7726, then such notice or citation may instead be provided to such representative, including notice as required by 20 Pa.C.S. § 7725 that each such representative may decline to act as a representative for the entity.

 (c) Counsel. If counsel has entered an appearance on behalf of an individual, entity or representative who would otherwise receive notice or a citation as provided under subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this Rule, then such notice or citation shall instead be given to counsel, except as provided in Rule 2.5(b) wherein the notice must be given to both counsel and the individual, entity or representative.

 (d) Additional service or notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the court having jurisdiction over the matter determines that the representation is or might be inadequate, then the court may in its discretion direct to whom a citation or notice shall be provided.

 Note: Rule 4.2 is derived from former Rule 5.2, but has been substantially modified to address virtual representation under 20 Pa.C.S. § 751(6) generally and representation in ''trust matters'' pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. § 7721 et seq. Cf. Rule 2.5(b) for different requirements that the notice must be mailed to the individual or entity and to counsel representing such individual or entity.

Rule 4.3. Service of Legal Paper Other than Citations or Notices.
 (a) Copies of all pleadings, and any brief or memorandum of law in connection therewith, other than notices served pursuant to Rule 2.5 or citations served pursuant to Rule 3.5(a), filed in an action or served upon any party to an action shall be served upon every other party to the action. This service shall be made:

 (1) by handing, or mailing by first-class United States mail, postage prepaid, a copy to, or leaving a copy for, each party at the address of the party's counsel of record listed on an entry of appearance or prior pleading of the party, or at such other address as a party may agree;

 (2) by transmitting a facsimile copy to the party's counsel of record as provided by subparagraph (c); or

 (3) by electronic transmission as provided in subparagraph (d).

 (b) If there is no attorney of record,

 (1) Service shall be made by handing a copy to the party or by mailing a copy to, or leaving a copy for, the party at the address listed on an entry of appearance or prior pleading or at the residence or place of business of the party, or by transmitting a facsimile copy as provided by subparagraph (c) or by electronic transmission as provided in subparagraph (d).

 (2) If such service cannot be made, service shall be made by leaving a copy at, or mailing a copy to, the last known address of the party to be served.

 (c)(1) A facsimile copy may be served if the parties agree thereto or if a facsimile telephone number is included on an entry of appearance or other legal paper previously filed with the court in the action.

 (2) A facsimile copy shall begin with a facsimile cover sheet containing:

 (i) the name, firm, address, telephone number, of both the party making service and the party served;

 (ii) the facsimile telephone number of the party making service and the facsimile telephone number to which the facsimile copy was transmitted;

 (iii) the title of the legal paper served; and

 (iv) the number of pages transmitted.

 (d) Service may be effected by electronic transmission if the parties agree thereto or if an email address is included on an entry of appearance or other legal paper previously filed with the court in the action.

 (e) Service by mail is complete upon mailing, and service by facsimile is complete when transmission is confirmed. Electronic service is complete when the legal paper is sent to the recipient's email address, or when the recipient is notified by email that a legal paper affecting the recipient has been filed and is available for review on the court's website.

 Note: Most of Rule 4.4 has no counterpart in former Orphans' Court Rules, but is based on Pa.R.C.P. No. 440 with modifications. Subparagraph (d) of this Rule is identical to former Rule 3.7(h)(2); it merely has been reformatted and relocated to this Chapter IV.

 Explanatory Comment: The Notes and Explanatory Comment appearing after Pa.R.C.P. No. 440 are fully incorporated by reference herein. Service of legal papers as provided in Rule 4.3 can occur even if the local judicial district has not implemented electronic filing.

Rule 4.4. Charities—Notice to the Attorney General.
 (a) In every court proceeding involving or affecting a charitable interest with the exception hereinafter set forth, at least 20 days advance written notice thereof shall be given to the Attorney General of the Commonwealth at the principal office in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, or to a deputy of the Attorney General designated for such purpose for the judicial district in which the proceeding is pending. The notice shall include or be accompanied by such of the following as may be appropriate:

 (1) the caption of the case;

 (2) a description of the nature of the proceeding;

 (3) the date, time and place when the matter is to be heard by the court to the extent then known;

 (4) the name of the decedent, settlor, incapacitated person or minor, if not disclosed by the caption;

 (5) a copy of the will or other instrument creating the charitable interest;

 (6) the name and address of any specific charity which may be affected by the proceeding;

 (7) if the charitable interest is a present interest, a description and the approximate market value of that interest;

 (8) if the charitable interest is a future interest and the estimated present value of the charity's future interest in the property exceeds $25,000, a brief description thereof including the conditions precedent to its vesting in enjoyment and possession, the names and ages of persons known to have interests preceding such charitable interest, and the approximate market value of the property involved;

 (9) a description of any unresolved claim and any material question of interpretation or distribution likely to be submitted for adjudication which may affect the value of the charitable interest;

 (10) the names and addresses of all fiduciaries;

 (11) the name and address of counsel for each fiduciary;

 (12) the name and address of counsel for any charity who has received notice or has appeared for the charity and the name of the charity which counsel represents; and

 (13) a copy of an Account if the proceeding involves an Account and if the charity is any one of the following:

 (i) a residuary beneficiary, including as a beneficiary of a residuary trust;

 (ii) a pecuniary legatee in an amount greater than $25,000; or

 (iii) a pecuniary legatee where the bequest has not and will not be paid in full.

 (b) Proof of service of the above notice or an acknowledgment of such notice received from the Attorney General or a deputy of the Attorney General shall be filed with the clerk in every proceeding involving a charitable interest prior to the entry of any decree.

 (c) Unless the court directs otherwise, no notice to the Attorney General or a deputy of the Attorney General shall be required with respect to a pecuniary legacy to a charity in the amount of $25,000 or less which has been or will be paid in full.

 Note: Rule 4.4 is substantively identical to former Rule 5.5.

 Explanatory Comment: See Appendix (OC-06) for form of notice under this Rule.

Rule 4.5. Service of Legal Paper by Court and Clerk.
 (a) The clerk and the court may serve all notices, opinions, and orders via electronic means where any one of the following has occurred:

 (1) the parties have agreed to receipt of legal paper by electronic transmission;

 (2) the underlying legal paper related to the notice, opinion or order was electronically filed; or

 (3) an email address appears on an entry of appearance or other legal paper previously filed with the clerk in the action.

 (b) The clerk and the court may serve all notices, opinions, and orders by facsimile in accordance with Rule 4.3(c).

 Note: Rule 4.5 is based upon former Rule 3.7(i); it has been reformatted and relocated to this Chapter IV.

 Explanatory Comment: This Rule 4.5 differs from its counterpart in former Rule 3.7(i) in several respects: first, this Rule permits the clerk and court to serve not only notices, but also opinions and orders, via electronic means as well as by facsimile; and second, it provides that the clerk and court are able to send notices, opinions, and orders via electronic means if the underlying legal paper was filed electronically. Service from the court and clerk as provided in Rule 4.5 can occur even if the local judicial district has not implemented electronic filing.

Rule 4.6. Notice of the Date of Entry of an Adjudication or Court Order on the Docket.
 (a) The clerk shall immediately give written notice of the entry of an adjudication or court order in a particular matter to each party's counsel of record or, if unrepresented, to each party. The notice shall include a copy of the adjudication or court order.

 (b) The clerk shall note in the docket the date when notice was given to the party or to his or her counsel under subparagraph (a) of this Rule.

 Note: Rule 4.6 has no counterpart in former Orphans' Court Rule, but is derived from Pa.R.C.P. No. 236.

Rule 4.7. Electronic Filing.
 (a) Authorization for Electronic Filing. A court may permit or require electronic filing of legal paper. Any court that implements electronic filing shall establish procedures governing such filing by local rule, which shall not be inconsistent with the procedures set forth herein.

 (b) Electronic Filing of Legal Paper.

 (1) If implemented by court, a filing party may file a legal paper with the clerk by means of electronic filing.

 (2) Any party may require the filing party to file the original of a legal paper or exhibit by filing a notice to file with the clerk and serving a copy of the notice upon the filing party. The filing party shall file the specified document with the clerk within 14 days after service of the notice. The court for any reason may direct any party to file the original of a legal paper or exhibit with the clerk within the time specified in the order. Upon disposition of the matter before the court, an original document may be returned to the party who filed it or retained by the court, as the court may determine.

 (c) Signature, Verification and Retention of Legal Paper.

 (1) The original legal paper shall be properly signed, and where required, verified.

 (2) The electronic filing of a legal paper constitutes a certification by the filing party that the original document was signed, and where applicable, verified.

 (3) Unless retained by the court, the filing party shall maintain the original of all documents so certified, together with any exhibits filed, for 5 years after the final disposition of the case.

 (d) Website and Filing Date.

 (1) The court shall designate a website for the electronic filing of legal paper. A user name and password shall be issued to authorized users.

 (2) The court shall provide electronic filing access at all times. The time and date of the filing shall be that registered by the court's computer system.

 (3) The court shall provide, through its website, an acknowledgement from the clerk that the filing has been processed. Such acknowledgement shall include the date and time of filing in a form which can be printed for retention by the filing party.

 (e) Delay in Filing. A filing party shall be responsible for any delay, disruption, or interruption of electronic transmission, and for the legibility of the document electronically filed, except for delays caused by the failure of the court's website. The filing party may petition the court to resolve any dispute concerning an alleged failure of the court's website.

 (f) Fees.

 (1) A filing party shall pay the fee for electronically filing a legal paper as provided by the court.

 (2) The court may assess an additional automation fee for each legal paper electronically filed which shall be used for the development, implementation, maintenance, and training in the use of the court's electronic filing system and other related uses.

 Note: Rule 4.7 is substantively identical to former Rule 3.7, but has been relocated to Chapter IV of these Rules.

 Explanatory Comment: This Rule is designed as a general enabling mechanism by which local judicial districts can, if they so choose, implement electronic filing. Implementation procedures not inconsistent with this Rule will be determined by local rules of court.

 Those jurisdictions which require e-filing must also provide the necessary technical assistance to those parties who lack the capacity to electronically file legal paper.

 Nothing in this Rule is intended to change the procedural requirements of Orphans' Court practice, as embodied in the statutes and rules of court. Rather, this Rule is intended to facilitate the delivery of legal paper to the court and the parties, as well as to reduce record management burdens in the office of the clerk. The terms ''electronic filing,'' ''filing party,'' and ''legal paper'' are defined in Rule 1.3.

 The court may, from time to time, modify the approved electronic filing system to take into consideration the costs and security of the system and the maintenance of electronic data and images.

Comment:
Pa.R.O.C.P. 1.8 is substantively similar to former Pa.R.O.C.P. 1.3, but with some modifications.

access to the forms is found at https://www.pacourts.us/forms/for-the-public/orphans-court-forms. The
forms posted on the website are capable of on-line completion.
In 2019, Pa.R.O.C.P. 1.8 was revised to permit versions of Supreme Court forms to be accepted
for filing, provided the replication was identical in content. This revision was intended to permit forms
to differ stylistically as to format if content requirements do not differ. This revision was not intended
to permit the re-ordering of content required by a form.

have attached to it a copy of the writing, or the material part thereof, but if the
writing or copy is not accessible to the pleader, it is sufficient so to state, identifying the reason therefor, and setting forth the substance of the writing.

Rule 3.5. Mode of Proceeding on Petition.
(a) Citation Practice.
(1) When personal jurisdiction is required and has not previously been
obtained or conferred by statute, or when a citation is otherwise required by
statute, the petition shall include a preliminary decree for the issuance of a
citation to those interested parties for whom a citation is necessary to show
cause why the relief requested in the petition should not be granted.
(2) The citation to obtain personal jurisdiction and a copy of the petition
shall be served upon each cited party at least 20 days before the date when a
responsive pleading is due, in the same manner as service of original process
under Pa.R.C.P. Nos. 402 through 404, Pa.R.C.P. No. 420, and Pa.R.C.P. Nos.
422 through 424 inclusive. If service cannot be made under the foregoing rules,
the court may order service by publication in accordance with Pa.R.C.P. No.
430. Service of a citation as original process shall not be permitted by electronic means, unless agreed to by the respondent.
(3) If the citation is not being issued in order to obtain personal jurisdiction over an interested party, the petition and the citation may be served by
first-class United States mail, postage prepaid, at least 20 days before the date
when a responsive pleading is due.
(4) If the citation and petition are not served at least 20 days before the
date when a responsive pleading is due, the court, upon request, may authorize
the reissuance of the citation.
(5) Once the citation to obtain personal jurisdiction has been served upon
the cited party by original process in accordance with subparagraph (a)(2), then
notice of a rescheduled return date or any other rescheduled date for filing a
responsive pleading or appearing before the court may be served by first-class
United States mail, postage prepaid, at least 20 days before such rescheduled
date.
(6) If an interested party (whether sui juris or not) is represented by
another, the citation and petition shall be served upon the interested party’s
representative(s) pursuant to Rule 4.2.
(7) Proof of service of the citation shall be filed with the clerk on or before
the date when a responsive pleading is due.
(8) Each interested party identified in the citation, or such interested party’s representative identified in the citation, may file a responsive pleading in
accordance with these Rules on or before the date provided in the citation.

(399701) No. 543 Feb. 20
(b) Notice Practice.
(1) In all cases where personal jurisdiction is not required or has been previously obtained, or conferred by statute, the petitioner shall, either in advance
of filing or contemporaneously therewith, provide a copy of the petition to the
interested parties identified in the petition. The petition shall have affixed to its
first page a notice to plead that shall be substantially in the following form:
To:
You are hereby notified to file a written response to the (name of
pleading) within twenty (20) days from the date of notice or on or
before the date when the pleading is to be filed, whichever is later, or
the court may deem that you have no objection to the relief requested
therein and may grant such relief without further notice to you.
(2) A certificate of service, listing the names and addresses of those individuals and entities receiving notice of the filing of the petition, shall be
appended to, or filed contemporaneously with, the petition.
(3) If an interested party (whether sui juris or not) is not receiving notice
of the filing of the petition because he or she is represented by another, a copy
of the petition shall be sent in accordance with subparagraph (b)(1) to the
interested party’s representative pursuant to Rule 4.2.
(c) Consents/Statements of No Objection; Joinders.
No citation or notice to plead is required where all individuals and/or entities
identified in the petition as interested parties (or any representative thereof) satisfy one of the following:
(1) they are named petitioners in the petition;
(2) they filed joinders to the petition; or
(3) they signed a document, that is attached to the petition as an exhibit,
consenting to or stating that they have no objection to the relief requested in
the petition.
Note: Subparagraphs (a) and (b) of Rule 3.5 are derived from former Rule 3.5. The final
sentence of subparagraph (a)(2) is identical to former Rule 3.7(h)(1); it merely has been relocated to this section. Subparagraph (c) of this Rule has no counterpart in former Orphans’ Court
Rules.
The filings required by this rule are subject to the Case Records Public Access Policy of the
Unified Judicial System of Pennsylvania. See Rule 1.99.
Explanatory Comment: Personal jurisdiction is conferred by statute in certain circumstances. See e.g., 20 Pa.C.S. § 7712. A sheriff does not need to serve the citation issued by the
clerk; instead, any adult person may serve the citation and file the proof of service in accordance
with subparagraph (a)(7) of this Rule 3.5. See 20 Pa.C.S. § 765. If a citation is not being issued
with the petition, then the petition must be endorsed with a notice to plead. See Rule 3.5(b) and
Pa.R.C.P. No. 1026. The court, by local rule or by order in a particular matter, may establish a
procedure for rules to show cause as provided in Pa.R.C.P. No. 206.4 et seq.

All responsive pleadings shall contain a heading identifying the name of the

Note: Rule 3.8 has no counterpart in former Orphans’ Court Rules.
Rule 3.9. Preliminary Objections.
(a) General. Preliminary objections may be filed to any petition by any interested party or the interested party’s representative.
(b) Grounds for Preliminary Objections. Preliminary objections filed to any
petition under the Rules of Chapter III are limited to the following grounds:
(1) lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action or lack of
jurisdiction over the person, improper venue, or improper form of service;
(2) failure of a pleading to conform to law or rule of court or inclusion of
scandalous or impertinent matter;
(3) insufficient specificity in a pleading;
(4) legal insufficiency of a pleading (demurrer);
(5) lack of standing or lack of capacity to sue, nonjoinder of a necessary
party, or misjoinder of a cause of action; and
(6) pendency of a prior action or agreement for alternative dispute resolution.
(c) Form. All preliminary objections shall be raised at one time in one pleading, shall state specifically the grounds relied upon, and may be inconsistent.
(d) Disposition of Preliminary Objections.
(1) A party may file an amended pleading, without consent of any other
party and without leave of court, within 20 days after service of the preliminary objections. If a party files an amended pleading, the preliminary objections to the original pleading shall be deemed moot.
(2) In all other instances, the court shall determine promptly all preliminary objections. If an issue of fact is raised, the court shall consider evidence
by deposition or otherwise.
(e) Pleadings Allowed Subsequent to the Disposition of Preliminary Objections.
(1) If the preliminary objections are overruled, the party who filed the preliminary objections shall have the right to file an answer within 20 days after
entry of the order overruling the preliminary objections or within such other
time as the court shall direct.

3-8
(399704) No. 543 Feb. 20 Copyright  2020 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
(2) If the filing of an amended petition or a new petition is allowed or
required, it shall be filed within 20 days after entry of the order concerning
such amended or new petition or within such other time as the court shall
direct.
(3) New preliminary objections may be filed to any amended or new petition in accordance with this Rule.
Note: Rule 3.9 has no counterpart in former Orphans’ Court Rules, but is derived from
Pa.R.C.P. No. 1028.
The filings required by this rule are subject to the Case Records Public Access Policy of the
Unified Judicial System of Pennsylvania. See Rule 1.99.
Explanatory Comment: Preliminary objections raising an issue under subparagraphs
(b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(4), and in some instances (b)(1), may be determined from the facts of record
so that further evidence is not required. In such situations, the court may summarily decide preliminary objections prior to the filing of an answer.
Preliminary objections raising an issue under subparagraphs (b)(5) and (b)(6), and in some
instances (b)(1), cannot be determined from the facts of record. In such situations, if the preliminary objections are not endorsed with a notice to plead in the form required by Rule
3.5(b)(1), no reply will be required under Rule 3.10, and the preliminary objections will be
overruled.
Pleadings may be amended only in accordance with subparagraphs (d)(1), (e)(2) or Rule 3.14.
For preliminary objections to Objections to an Account, petition for adjudication/statement of
proposed distribution or a notice, cf. Rule 2.8(b) for a more limited scope of permitted preliminary objections.

Rule 3.10. Denials; Effect of Failure to Deny.
(a) A responsive pleading shall admit or deny each averment of fact in the
preceding pleading or any part thereof. Admissions and denials in a responsive
pleading shall refer specifically to the paragraph in which the averment admitted
or denied is set forth. A party denying only a part of an averment shall specify so
much of it as is admitted and shall deny the remainder.
(b) Averments in a pleading to which a responsive pleading is required are
admitted when not denied specifically or by necessary implication. A general
denial or a demand for proof, except as provided by subparagraph (c) of this
Rule, shall have the effect of an admission.
(c) A statement by a party that after reasonable investigation the party is
without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of an
averment shall have the effect of a denial.
(d) Averments in a pleading to which no responsive pleading is required shall
be deemed to be denied.
(e) A responsive pleading shall be signed by counsel, or if not represented by
counsel, then by all the respondents in accordance with Rule 3.12. A responsive

Explanatory Comment: Reliance on subparagraph (c) does not excuse a failure to admit
or deny a factual allegation when it is clear that the respondent must know whether a particular
allegation is true or false. Cf. Cercone v. Cercone, 386 A.2d 1, 4 (Pa. Super. 1978).

Rule 3.13. Verification.
(a) Every pleading shall be verified, averring as true every fact not appearing
of record in the action or containing a denial of fact based upon the signer’s personal knowledge or information and belief. A pleading may be verified upon personal knowledge as to a part and upon information and belief as to the remainder. The signer need not aver the source of the information or expectation of
ability to prove the averment or denial at the trial.
(b) If a pleading contains averments that are inconsistent in fact, the verification shall state that the signer has been unable after reasonable investigation to
ascertain which of the inconsistent averments, specifying them, are true but that
the signer has knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief that one of
them is true.
(c) The verification shall be made by one or more of the parties filing the
pleading unless all the parties (1) lack sufficient knowledge or information, or (2)
are outside the jurisdiction of the court and the verification of none of them can
be obtained within the time allowed for filing the pleading. In such cases, the
verification may be made by any person having sufficient knowledge or information and belief and shall set forth the source of the person’s information as to
matters not stated upon his or her own knowledge and the reason why the verification is not made by a party.
Note: Rule 3.13 has no counterpart in former Orphans’ Court Rules, but is derived from
Pa.R.C.P. No. 1024.
Rule 3.14. Amendment.
A party may amend a pleading pursuant to Rule 3.9(d)(1), or at any other time,
either by written consent of all other parties filed with the clerk or by leave of
court. The amended pleading may aver transactions or occurrences that have happened before or after the filing of the original pleading. An amendment may be
made to conform the pleading to the evidence offered or admitted.

similar sheets) of good quality.
(c) The text must be double spaced, but quotations more than two lines long
may be indented and single-spaced. Margins must be at least one inch on all four
sides.
(d) The lettering shall be clear and legible and no smaller than point 12. The
lettering shall be on only one side of a page, except that exhibits and similar supporting documents may be double-sided.
Note: Rule 4.1 has no counterpart in former Orphans’ Court Rules, but is derived from
Pa.R.C.P. No. 204.1.
Explanatory Comment: Rule 4.1 governing the format of legal paper is modeled after
Pa.R.C.P. No. 204.1 and thus is substantively identical to Pa.R.A.P. No. 124(a) and Pa.R.Crim.P.
575(C). See Explanatory Comment to Pa.R.C.P. No. 204.1. The goal is to foster uniformity in
LEGAL PAPER 231 Rule 4.1
4-1
(382121) No. 502 Sep. 16
the formatting of legal paper filed in all judicial tribunals, regardless of the level of court or
division of court; this uniformity, in turn, will promote the objective of the unified judicial system under the Constitution of 1968 and facilitate the statewide practice of law.
Rule 4.2. Citation or Notice to Individuals and Entities.
(a) To individuals. Whenever a citation under Rule 3.5(a) is to be served or
notice under Rule 2.5 or Rule 3.5(b) is to be given to an individual:
(1) If the individual is sui juris, or if the individual has reached the age of
18 and is believed to be incapacitated (under the provisions of Chapter 55 of
Title 20), but for whom no guardian is known to have been appointed by a
Pennsylvania court or by the court of any other jurisdiction (including a guardian ad litem with respect to the matter at issue), then such notice or citation
shall be provided:
(i) to the individual; or
(ii) if the individual will be represented with respect to the matter at
issue by a representative under the provisions of 20 Pa.C.S. §§ 7721—7726,
then such notice or citation may instead be provided to such representative,
including notice as required by 20 Pa.C.S. § 7725 that each such representative may decline to act as a representative for the sui juris individual.
(2) If the individual is not sui juris, or is unborn, unknown or unascertained, then such notice or citation shall be provided to such individual’s representative with respect to the matter at issue under the provisions of 20
Pa.C.S. §§ 751(6) or 7721—7726, including notice required by 20 Pa.C.S.
§ 7725 that each such representative may decline to act as a representative for
the individual; provided, however, that if a guardian or trustee ad litem has
been appointed to represent such individual by the court having jurisdiction
over the matter at issue, then such notice or citation shall also be provided to
the guardian or trustee ad litem.
(b) To entities. Whenever a citation under Rule 3.5(a) is to be served or notice
under Rule 2.5 or Rule 3.5(b) is to be given to an entity, then such citation or
notice shall be provided:
(1) to the entity through the entity’s duly authorized representative; or
(2) if the entity will be represented with respect to the matter at issue by a
representative under the provisions of 20 Pa.C.S. §§ 7721—7726, then such
notice or citation may instead be provided to such representative, including
notice as required by 20 Pa.C.S. § 7725 that each such representative may
decline to act as a representative for the entity.
(c) Counsel. If counsel has entered an appearance on behalf of an individual,
entity or representative who would otherwise receive notice or a citation as provided under subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this Rule, then such notice or citation
shall instead be given to counsel, except as provided in Rule 2.5(b) wherein the
notice must be given to both counsel and the individual, entity or representative.

(d) Additional service or notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the court
having jurisdiction over the matter determines that the representation is or might
be inadequate, then the court may in its discretion direct to whom a citation or
notice shall be provided.
Note: Rule 4.2 is derived from former Rule 5.2, but has been substantially modified to
address virtual representation under 20 Pa.C.S. § 751(6) generally and representation in ‘‘trust
matters’’ pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. § 7721 et seq. Cf. Rule 2.5(b) for different requirements that
the notice must be mailed to the individual or entity and to counsel representing such individual
or entity.
Rule 4.3. Service of Legal Paper Other than Citations or Notices.
(a) Copies of all pleadings, and any brief or memorandum of law in connection therewith, other than notices served pursuant to Rule 2.5 or citations served
pursuant to Rule 3.5(a), filed in an action or served upon any party to an action
shall be served upon every other party to the action. This service shall be made:
(1) by handing, or mailing by first-class United States mail, postage prepaid, a copy to, or leaving a copy for, each party at the address of the party’s
counsel of record listed on an entry of appearance or prior pleading of the

by electronic transmission as provided in subparagraph (d).
(2) If such service cannot be made, service shall be made by leaving a
copy at, or mailing a copy to, the last known address of the party to be served.
(c)(1) A facsimile copy may be served if the parties agree thereto or if a facsimile telephone number is included on an entry of appearance or other legal
paper previously filed with the court in the action.
(2) A facsimile copy shall begin with a facsimile cover sheet containing:
(i) the name, firm, address, telephone number, of both the party making service and the party served;

facsimile telephone number to which the facsimile copy was transmitted;
(iii) the title of the legal paper served; and
(iv) the number of pages transmitted.
(d) Service may be effected by electronic transmission if the parties agree
thereto or if an email address is included on an entry of appearance or other legal
paper previously filed with the court in the action.
(e) Service by mail is complete upon mailing, and service by facsimile is

the legal paper is sent to the recipient’s email address, or when the recipient is
notified by email that a legal paper affecting the recipient has been filed and is
available for review on the court’s website.
(f) A certificate of service shall be attached to any legal paper filed or served
pursuant to this Rule, setting forth the manner of service and listing the names
and addresses of those individuals and entities served with the legal paper.
Note: Most of Rule 4.4 has no counterpart in former Orphans’ Court Rules, but is based on
Pa.R.C.P. No. 440 with modifications. Subparagraph (d) of this Rule is identical to former Rule
3.7(h)(2); it merely has been reformatted and relocated to this Chapter IV.
Explanatory Comment: The Notes and Explanatory Comment appearing after Pa.R.C.P.
No. 440 are fully incorporated by reference herein. Service of legal papers as provided in Rule
4.3 can occur even if the local judicial district has not implemented electronic filing.

Rule 4.4. Charities—Notice to the Attorney General.
(a) In every court proceeding involving or affecting a charitable interest with
the exception hereinafter set forth, at least 20 days advance written notice thereof
shall be given to the Attorney General of the Commonwealth at the principal
office in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, or to a deputy of the Attorney General designated for such purpose for the judicial district in which the proceeding is pending. The notice shall include or be accompanied by such of the following as may

(1) the caption of the case;

description thereof including the conditions precedent to its vesting in enjoyment and possession, the names and ages of persons known to have interests
preceding such charitable interest, and the approximate market value of the
property involved;
(9) a description of any unresolved claim and any material question of
interpretation or distribution likely to be submitted for adjudication which may
affect the value of the charitable interest;

(12) the name and address of counsel for any charity who has received
notice or has appeared for the charity and the name of the charity which counsel represents; and

filed with the clerk in every proceeding involving a charitable interest prior to the
entry of any decree.

Note: Rule 4.4 is substantively identical to former Rule 5.5.
Explanatory Comment: See Appendix (OC-06) for form of notice under this Rule.
Rule 4.5. Service of Legal Paper by Court and Clerk.
(a) The clerk and the court may serve all notices, opinions, and orders via
electronic means where any one of the following has occurred:
(1) the parties have agreed to receipt of legal paper by electronic transmission;
(2) the underlying legal paper related to the notice, opinion or order was
electronically filed; or
(3) an email address appears on an entry of appearance or other legal paper
previously filed with the clerk in the action.

Explanatory Comment: This Rule 4.5 differs from its counterpart in former Rule 3.7(i) in
several respects: first, this Rule permits the clerk and court to serve not only notices, but also
opinions and orders, via electronic means as well as by facsimile; and second, it provides that
the clerk and court are able to send notices, opinions, and orders via electronic means if the
underlying legal paper was filed electronically. Service from the court and clerk as provided in
Rule 4.5 can occur even if the local judicial district has not implemented electronic filing.

Rule 4.7. Electronic Filing.
(a) Authorization for Electronic Filing. A court may permit or require electronic filing of legal paper. Any court that implements electronic filing shall
establish procedures governing such filing by local rule, which shall not be
inconsistent with the procedures set forth herein.
(b) Electronic Filing of Legal Paper.
(1) If implemented by court, a filing party may file a legal paper with the
clerk by means of electronic filing.
(2) Any party may require the filing party to file the original of a legal
paper or exhibit by filing a notice to file with the clerk and serving a copy of
the notice upon the filing party. The filing party shall file the specified document with the clerk within 14 days after service of the notice. The court for any
reason may direct any party to file the original of a legal paper or exhibit with
the clerk within the time specified in the order. Upon disposition of the matter
before the court, an original document may be returned to the party who filed
it or retained by the court, as the court may determine.
(c) Signature, Verification and Retention of Legal Paper.
(1) The original legal paper shall be properly signed, and where required,
verified.
(2) The electronic filing of a legal paper constitutes a certification by the
filing party that the original document was signed, and where applicable, verified.
(3) Unless retained by the court, the filing party shall maintain the original
of all documents so certified, together with any exhibits filed, for 5 years after
the final disposition of the case.
(d) Website and Filing Date.
(1) The court shall designate a website for the electronic filing of legal
paper. A user name and password shall be issued to authorized users.
(2) The court shall provide electronic filing access at all times. The time
and date of the filing shall be that registered by the court’s computer system.
231 Rule 4.6 ORPHANS’ COURT RULES
4-6
(399708) No. 543 Feb. 20 Copyright  2020 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
(3) The court shall provide, through its website, an acknowledgement from
the clerk that the filing has been processed. Such acknowledgement shall
include the date and time of filing in a form which can be printed for retention
by the filing party.
(e) Delay in Filing. A filing party shall be responsible for any delay, disruption, or interruption of electronic transmission, and for the legibility of the document electronically filed, except for delays caused by the failure of the court’s
website. The filing party may petition the court to resolve any dispute concerning
an alleged failure of the court’s website.
(f) Fees.
(1) A filing party shall pay the fee for electronically filing a legal paper as
provided by the court.
(2) The court may assess an additional automation fee for each legal paper
electronically filed which shall be used for the development, implementation,
maintenance, and training in the use of the court’s electronic filing system and
other related uses.
Note: Rule 4.7 is substantively identical to former Rule 3.7, but has been relocated to
Chapter IV of these Rules.
Explanatory Comment: This Rule is designed as a general enabling mechanism by which
local judicial districts can, if they so choose, implement electronic filing. Implementation procedures not inconsistent with this Rule will be determined by local rules of court.
Those jurisdictions which require e-filing must also provide the necessary technical assistance
to those parties who lack the capacity to electronically file legal paper.
Nothing in this Rule is intended to change the procedural requirements of Orphans’ Court
practice, as embodied in the statutes and rules of court. Rather, this Rule is intended to facilitate
the delivery of legal paper to the court and the parties, as well as to reduce record management
burdens in the office of the clerk. The terms ‘‘electronic filing,’’ ‘‘filing party,’’ and ‘‘legal
paper’’ are defined in Rule 1.3.
The court may, from time to time, modify the approved electronic filing system to take into
consideration the costs and security of the system and the maintenance of electronic data and
images.

(1) facts establishing a prima facie right of the petitioner to the exemption;
(2) whether allowance of the claim is being requested prior to the confirmation or audit of the Account;
(3) a description of the property claimed; and
(4) if the exemption is claimed from real estate and a valuation has not
been agreed upon by all interested parties, the nomination of two appraisers for
appointment by the court to appraise the same.
(b) Exhibits. A copy of the qualifications and credentials of the two appraisers nominated in the petition for appointment by the court shall be attached to the
petition as exhibits.
231 Rule 5.1 ORPHANS’ COURT RULES
5-2
(402508) No. 552 Nov. 20 Copyright  2020 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
(c) Award by Consent. The court may, at the request of the petitioner, award
in distribution specific real estate included in the Account in satisfaction of, or on
account of, the family exemption without compliance with the procedure outlined
in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this Rule if all interested parties agree in writing
that the petitioner is entitled to the family exemption and to the valuation at
which such real estate is to be awarded.
Note: Rule 5.2 is based upon former Rule 12.1.
Rule 5.3. Intestate Share to Surviving Spouse from Real Estate.
(a) Contents of Petition. When no Account is filed and all or part of the
spouse’s intestate share under 20 Pa.C.S. § 2102 is claimed from real estate, the
claim shall be presented by petition, which shall conform to the requirements
provided by the Rules in Chapter III, and shall set forth the following:
(1) facts establishing a prima facie right of the spouse to the statutory
intestate share;
(2) a description of the property claimed; and
(3) if the share is claimed from real estate and a valuation has not been
agreed upon by all interested parties, the nomination of two appraisers for
appointment by the court to appraise the same.
(b) Exhibits. A copy of the qualifications and credentials of the two appraisers nominated in the petition for appointment by the court shall be attached to the
petition as exhibits.
(c) Award by Consent. The court may, at the request of the surviving spouse,
award specific real estate in satisfaction of, or on account of, the spouse’s statutory intestate share without compliance with the procedure outlined in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this Rule if all interested parties agree in writing that the
surviving spouse is entitled to the statutory share and to the valuation at which
such real estate is to be awarded.
Note: Rule 5.3 is based upon former Rule 12.2.
Explanatory Comment: Deletion of specific reference to the former statutory allowance of
$10,000.00 increased to $30,000.00 allows greater flexibility. The Rule would not need to be
amended in the future if the statutory amount should be further increased. With the broader language employed there is no longer any need to refer to the specific statutory provisions. As
amended, the Rule recognizes the present practice of making the award of real estate in satisfaction of the spouse’s allowance a part of the distribution decree when a court accounting is
filed. While this Rule will be employed only in a minimum of instances for the foregoing reason and also because of the availability of § 3546 of Title 20, it, nevertheless, is considered
advisable to preserve it in its altered form as a guide when it is to be employed.

in personal representative, a personal representative or the personal representative’s counsel shall send a written notice of estate administration in the form
approved by the Supreme Court to:
(1) every person, corporation, association, entity or other party named in
decedent’s will as a beneficiary, whether individually or as a class member;
(2) the decedent’s spouse and children, whether or not they are named in,
or have an interest under, the will;
(3) where there is an intestacy in whole or in part, to every person entitled
to inherit as an intestate heir under Chapter 21 of Title 20;
(4) the appointed guardian of the estate, parent or legal custodian of any
beneficiary who is a minor;
(5) the appointed guardian of the estate or, in the absence of such appointment, the institution or person with custody of any beneficiary who is an adjudicated incapacitated person;
(6) the Attorney General on behalf of any charitable beneficiary (i) which
is a residuary beneficiary, including as a beneficiary of a residuary testamentary trust; (ii) whose legacy exceeds $25,000; or (iii) whose interest in a legacy
will not be paid in full;
(7) the Attorney General on behalf of any governmental beneficiary;
(8) the fiduciary of any estate or trust which is a beneficiary or, if the personal representative is a fiduciary of such estate or trust, then the beneficiaries
of such estate or trust; and
(9) such other persons and in such manner as may be required by local
rule.
(b) A ‘‘beneficiary’’ shall be deemed to include any person who may have an
interest by virtue of the Pennsylvania anti-lapse statute, 20 Pa.C.S. § 2514.

each person and entity entitled to notice under subparagraph (a)(1)—(9) whose

REGISTER OF WILLS 231 Rule 10.5
10-3
(420999) No. 602 Jan. 25
Note: Rule 10.5 is derived from former Rule 5.6. Subdivision (a) applies to an initial grant
of letters and to all changes in personal representative, including a grant of letters to a successor
personal representative or due to the death or resignation of a personal representative when there
are other personal representatives who continue to serve. Subdivision (d) of this Rule does not
prohibit the Register from charging a fee for filing this certification. The form of notice and certification of notice required by Rule 10.5 is set forth in the Appendix. Subdivision (e) of this
Rule is not intended to limit the inherent power of the court to impose sanctions upon a delinquent personal representative or counsel.
Explanatory Comment: It is not the intention of this Rule to require notice beyond the
degree of consanguinity entitling a person to inherit under Chapter 21 of Title 20.

Rule 10.6. Status Report by Personal Representative.
(a) Report of Uncompleted Administration. If administration of an estate has
not been completed within two years of the decedent’s death, the personal representative or counsel shall file at such time, and annually thereafter until the
administration is completed, a report with the Register showing the date by which
the personal representative or his, her, or its counsel reasonably believes administration will be completed.
(b) Report of Completed Administration. Upon completion of the administration of an estate, the personal representative or his, her or its counsel shall file
with the Register a report showing:
(1) completion of administration of the estate;
(2) whether a formal Account was filed with the Orphans’ Court;
(3) whether a complete Account was informally stated to all parties in
interest;
(4) whether final distribution has been completed; and
(5) whether approvals of the Account, receipts, joinders and releases have
been filed with the clerk.
(c) Form of Status Report. The report required by this Rule shall be in the
form approved by the Supreme Court.
(d) Copy of Rule. Upon the grant of letters, the Register shall give a copy of
Rule 10.6 to each personal representative not represented by counsel.
(e) Failure to File a Status Report. After at least ten (10) days subsequent to
providing written notice to a delinquent personal representative and counsel, the
Register shall inform the court of the failure to file the report required by this
Rule with a request that the court conduct a hearing to determine what sanctions,
if any, should be imposed.
Note: Rule 10.6 is based upon former Rule 6.12, except that this Rule no longer includes
former subparagraph (d) that prohibited the Register from charging a fee for filing the status
report. The form of status report required by Rule 10.6 is set forth in the Appendix.

Rule 10.7. Disclosure of Certain Digital Assets or a Catalog of Electronic
Communications of a Decedent.
(a) At Time of Filing Petition for Grant of Letters. If a personal representative intends to access the digital assets or a catalog of electronic communications
of a decedent, other than the content of the decedent’s electronic communications,
the personal representative may file with the petition an affidavit containing the
recitals set forth in 20 Pa.C.S. § 3908(b). The affidavit shall be taken before and
administered by the Register pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. § 3908(c).
(b) After Filing Petition for Grant of Letters. If a personal representative
intends to access the digital assets or a catalog of electronic communications of
a decedent, other than the content of the decedent’s electronic communications,
the personal representative may file an affidavit with the Register containing the
recitals set forth in 20 Pa.C.S. § 3908(b). The affidavit shall be taken before and
administered by the Register pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. § 3908(c).
(c) Upon Request of a Custodian. If a custodian requests a finding of the
court with respect to a catalog of electronic communications of a decedent pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. § 3908(a)(4)(iv) from a personal representative who has not
already filed an affidavit as provided under subdivisions (a) or (b):
(1) the personal representative may file an affidavit with the Register pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. § 3908(b)(1); and
(2) provide the custodian a copy of the affidavit bearing evidence of filing
with the Register.
Comment: This rule is intended to implement § 3908 of the Revised Uniform Fiduciary
Access to Digital Assets Act relating to the disclosure of certain digital assets or a catalog of
electronic communications of a decedent, other than the content of such electronic communications, to a personal representative. See 20 Pa.C.S. § 3908. Relevant terms, such as ‘‘catalog of
electronic communications,’’ ‘‘content of electronic communication,’’ ‘‘custodian,’’ and ‘‘digital
asset’’ are defined by statute. See 20 Pa.C.S. § 3902. This rule does not apply to access to the
contents of a decedent’s electronic communications; such access is governed by 20 Pa.C.S.
§ 3907.
A filing made pursuant to subdivision (a) or (b) is independent of any filing made pursuant
to subdivision (c).
An affidavit filed by the personal representative with the Register pursuant to subdivision (c)
is not required to be taken before and administered by the Register. See 20 Pa.C.S. § 3908(b)(1)
(requiring, in pertinent part, that the affidavit be filed subject to penalties under 18 Pa.C.S.
§ 4904 (relating to unsworn falsification to authorities)). Moreover, such an affidavit does not
need to be notarized.
While Registers are not subject to the Case Records Public Access Policy of the Unified
Judicial System, they are encouraged to ensure the confidentiality of identifying information
contained in affidavits filed pursuant to this rule. See Case Records Public Access Policy of the
Unified Judicial System, § 1.0, Comment.

(Petition to Enforce a Contact Agreement), and Rule 15.19 (Petition to Discontinue a Contact Agreement).
(b) Filing of Original Birth Certificate. Unless previously filed, the child’s
original birth certificate or certification of registration of birth shall be filed when
the petition to terminate parental rights is filed, and the clerk shall make the
original birth certificate or certification of registration of birth part of the court
file pertaining to that child.
Explanatory Comment
For the following reasons, a separate petition must be filed for each child and any adult adoptee
who is the subject of any one of the enumerated proceedings: (i) privacy concerns; (ii) better and more
accurate data collection, especially if siblings do not share the same birth parents; and (iii) facilitating
appellate proceedings if an appeal from an order terminating parental rights is taken as to only one of
the involved children. The court in its discretion may consolidate separate petitions for any hearing.
A county agency unduly burdened by the costs of filing separate petitions for a group of siblings
may petition the court for relief from such filing costs. It is anticipated that such petitions for relief
would be made only when the costs are burdensome.

account, or to the person’s counsel of record, if represented.
(c) Timing of Notice. Notice of the hearing shall be provided at least 10 days
prior to the date of the hearing.
Explanatory Comment
The notice required by subparagraph (a)(3) advises a parent whose rights are subject to termination
in an involuntary termination proceeding that he or she has the right to be represented at the hearing
by a lawyer. The notice includes the contact information for the person or agency in the judicial district from whom information as to the availability of legal help may be obtained. The court shall
appoint counsel for a parent whose rights are subject to termination in an involuntary termination
proceeding, if upon petition of the parent, the court determines that the parent is unable to pay for
counsel or that payment would result in substantial financial hardship. See 23 Pa.C.S. § 2313(a.1);
Rule 15.10(d)(2).
Personal service in the context of this Rule means service by handing a copy to the person entitled
to notice.
See Pa.R.C.P. No. 76 that certified mail is the equivalent of registered mail.
See also Pa.R.C.P. No. 430(a) regarding the averments necessary in a motion for alternative service if service cannot otherwise be accomplished. If the motion under Pa.R.C.P. No. 430(a) avers sufficient facts and includes sufficient supporting exhibits to establish that a reasonable investigation was
made to ascertain the identity or whereabouts of the subject birth parent, the court need not conduct

a hearing on the motion, but shall issue an order directing alternative service, including service by
electronic transmission or publication.
The PACFile electronic filing system, developed and administered by the Administrative Office of
Pennsylvania Courts, does not provide notice of the hearing that is compliant with the requirements
of (b)(1)(C) and (b)(2)(C), unless a person consents in writing to notices being sent by electronic
transmission. In the alternative, a court may, per subparagraphs (b)(1)(D), (b)(2)(D), and (b)(3)(A)(iii)
and dependent upon the facts of an individual case, permit notification of the hearing by PACFile
without requiring consent in writing that the notice be sent by electronic transmission.

Rule 15.5. Certification Filed with the Clerk Maintaining the Dependency
Docket.
(a) Within seven days of the filing of a petition to terminate parental rights
under Rules 15.7, 15.8, 15.9, or 15.10, or a petition to adopt under Rule 15.13,
the county agency shall file a praecipe with the clerk of the court where the child
was declared dependent using the caption of the dependency proceeding, notifying that clerk of the name of the petition filed and the date of its filing in substantially the form approved by the Supreme Court.
(b) Within seven days of receiving the court’s disposition of the petitions
described in paragraph (a), the county agency shall file a praecipe with the clerk
of the court where the child was declared dependent using the caption of the
dependency proceeding, notifying that clerk of the disposition of the petition and
the date of the order in substantially the form approved by the Supreme Court.
(c) If a notice of appeal from an order described in paragraph (b) is filed, then
within seven days of service of the notice of appeal, the county agency shall file
a praecipe with the clerk of the court where the child was declared dependent
using the caption of the dependency proceeding, notifying that clerk of the appeal
and the date of its filing in substantially the form approved by the Supreme Court.
(d) Within seven days of receiving the appellate court’s disposition of the
appeal described in paragraph (c), the county agency shall file a praecipe with the
clerk of the court where the child was declared dependent using the caption of
the dependency proceeding, notifying that clerk of the disposition of the appeal
and the date of the decision in substantially the form approved by the Supreme
Court.
Explanatory Comment
The purpose of the Rule is to provide a procedure for collecting data concerning children who have
been declared dependent under the Juvenile Act and placed in the custody of the county agency. The
information is entered into the Common Pleas Case Management System-Dependency Module to
comply with reporting requirements and to monitor dependent children in the foster care system.
Unlike a ‘‘notice,’’ as used in Rule 15.4, the county agency is not required to serve the praecipe upon
ADOPTIONS 231 Rule 15.5
15-7
(409793) No. 572 Jul. 22
the parties to the dependency, termination, or adoption proceeding. The definition of ‘‘county agency’’
as used in this Rule is that contained in Pa.R.J.C.P. 1120.
Pursuant to Rule 1.8 (Forms), the Supreme Court has approved forms for statewide practice to
comply with the requirements of this Rule. These forms can be found in the Appendix to these Rules.

Rule 15.6. Filing of Termination Petitions when an Agency is Not
Involved.
Except in cases involving an agency or as otherwise provided by law, a petition to terminate parental rights shall not be granted unless a Report of Intention
to Adopt under 23 Pa.C.S. § 2531 or an adoption petition under Rule 15.13 has
been filed.
Explanatory Comment
This Rule implements long-standing Pennsylvania Supreme Court precedent that a parent can petition to terminate the parental rights of the other parent only where there is evidence of a present plan
for the child to be adopted by a stepparent or other person. In re Adoption of M.R.D., 145 A.3d 1117,
1120 (Pa. 2016); In re T.R., 465 A.2d 642 (Pa. 1983); In re B.E., 377 A.2d 153 (Pa. 1977). See also
In re E.M.I, 57 A.3d 1278 (Pa. Super. 2012); In re Adoption of J.F., 572 A.2d 223 (Pa. Super. 1990).
A mere averment in the petition or testimony by the petitioning birth parent is insufficient; instead,
evidence must be presented to the court considering the parental rights termination petition that the
child’s adoption is intended and foreseeable. However, neither such averments nor evidence are
required when a petition has been filed by a parent seeking to involuntarily terminate the parental
rights of the other parent pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S. § 2511(a)(7) (relating to a child conceived as a result
of a rape or incest). See 23 Pa.C.S. § 2514.
A Report of Intention to Adopt is required to be filed with the clerk within 30 days of when the
child is placed with the non-relative individuals. 23 Pa.C.S. § 2532. In the case of an adoption by
one not required to file such a report, see 23 Pa.C.S. § 2531(c), this Rule requires the adoption petition to be filed. If the adoption proceeding will occur in the same judicial district as the hearing on
the parental rights termination petition, the court will be able to review the Report of Intention to
Adopt or the adoption petition to determine if there are any possible impediments to completing the
adoption, which then can be explored and investigated as part of the hearing on the parental rights
termination petition.

(12) that each petitioner understands the petition, has considered the alternatives, and has executed the petition voluntarily.
(b) Exhibits. The following exhibits shall be attached to the petition:
(1) Documentation signed by each petitioner as required by 23 Pa.C.S.
§ 2501(a).
(2) A verified statement from a representative of the agency, counsel for

(4) The joinder or consent of the agency having care of the child, including its consent to accept custody of the child until such time as the child is

rights of a putative father are to be terminated as part of the same proceeding,
and shall be served in accordance with Rule 15.4(b)(1).
(2) On or before the hearing, the court shall be presented with a certificate
of service stating that notice of the hearing on the petition was given to the
petitioner and all others entitled to a copy of the notice in accordance with 23
Pa.C.S. § 2503 and Rule 15.4(b)(1).
(3) The petitioner birth parent voluntarily relinquishing his or her parental
rights shall be present at the hearing and available to be examined under oath.
(4) If as part of hearing on the petition, the parental rights of a putative

written notice was provided to the subject putative father regarding the opportunity of a birth relative to enter into a Contact Agreement, that such notice was

to the last known address, or by electronic transmission in accordance with
Rule 15.4(b)(1)(C), and the date(s) that such notice was given or the reasons
why such notice cannot be given, including efforts made to identify or locate
the subject person. If notice was given, a copy of the notice shall accompany
this verified statement.
Explanatory Comment
Section 2733(c) of the Adoption Act requires the agency, the intermediary or an attorney for a party
to provide notice of the opportunity to enter into a Contact Agreement to the Prospective Adoptive
Parents, a birth parent, and, in some instances, a child. Notice to a birth relative who is not a birth
parent is not statutorily required, although birth relatives may enter into and become parties to a Contact Agreement.
An original birth certificate or certification of registration of the child’s birth must be filed with the
clerk by the time of filing the initial petition to terminate parental rights. See Rule 15.3(b).

Explanatory Comment
An original birth certificate or certification of registration of the child’s birth must be filed with the
clerk by the time of filing the initial petition to terminate parental rights. See Rule 15.3(b).
If the petitioner is an agency, Prospective Adoptive Parents need not have been identified prior to
the agency’s filing of a petition to involuntarily terminate parental rights. Also, an averment of a present intent to adopt the child is not required if the petitioner is an agency. Where petitioner is an individual, see Rule 15.6. Neither the averments nor evidence set forth in subdivisions (a)(13) and (b)(2)
are required when the petition has been filed by a parent seeking to involuntarily terminate the parental rights of the other parent pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S. § 2511(a)(7) (relating to a child conceived as a
result of a rape or incest). See 23 Pa.C.S. § 2514.
ADOPTIONS 231 Rule 15.10

(421003) No. 602 Jan. 25
Section 2733(c) of the Adoption Act requires the agency or intermediary, counsel representing the
agency or intermediary, or counsel representing any other party to provide notice to the Prospective
Adoptive Parents, birth parents, and, in some instances, a child of the opportunity to enter into a Contact Agreement. The statute does not require notice to birth relatives who are not the birth parents,
although birth relatives may enter into and become parties to a Contact Agreement.
It is understood that County Agencies may be encouraged early in the process, even during dependency proceedings, to give notice to a birth parent of the opportunity to enter into a Contact Agreement. Requiring the verified statement to set forth the specific date(s) as to when notice was given is
only to further ensure that the particular notice was given and not to suggest that providing this notice
is time sensitive and expires after a certain time.

(g) Court Decree. The court shall review and grant or deny the petition to
approve the proposed agreement on or before the date of any adoption decree

Explanatory Comment
Although agreements providing for post-adoption contact and communication may be negotiated
and entered without anyone seeking judicial approval, the court will enforce and provide remedies
only for those agreements that receive court approval on or before the date when the adoption is
finalized. See 23 Pa.C.S. §§ 2735(c), 2738(c)(2).
Discussions about post-adoption contact and communication agreements should begin as early as
possible, especially once all the necessary parties are identified. To this end, the courts can review
and approve a proposed agreement for post-adoption contact and communication at any time after
termination of parental rights and prior to finalization of the adoption. If practical, a hearing on the
petition to approve an executed proposed agreement may be conducted immediately following a hearing to terminate parental rights by the same judge who presided over the termination hearing. This
ADOPTIONS 231 Rule 15.12
15-21
(409807) No. 572 Jul. 22
Rule establishes where the petition to approve the proposed agreement may be filed depending upon
whether Prospective Adoptive Parents have been identified by the time of the hearing to terminate
parental rights.
Section 2735 of the Adoption Act, 23 Pa.C.S. § 2735, does not indicate who is responsible for filing the petition seeking court approval of the proposed agreement for post-adoption contact and communication. The Orphans’ Court Procedural Rules Committee decided not to require a particular party
to file the requisite petition in all instances, but rather, to allow the individuals to the proposed agreement and the agency or intermediary facilitating the negotiation and development of the proposed
agreement to determine who should be responsible for drafting and filing the petition depending upon
the resources and circumstances of all those involved.
Section 2735 of the Adoption Act, 23 Pa.C.S. § 2735, does not require a hearing in order for the
court to approve the proposed agreement, and the Orphans’ Court Procedural Rules Committee
decided not to impose an evidentiary hearing requirement in all instances. Nevertheless, given that
one who has not attained the age of 18 cannot attest to a notary that he or she executed or consented
to a proposed agreement voluntarily, knowingly, without coercion, fraud or duress, best practices
would be for the court to conduct its own inquiry whenever a child or any of the child’s minor siblings signed a separate consent agreeing to the proposed agreement or signed the proposed agreement
as evidence of such consent. At such hearing, the court can ensure that any individual who is a minor
consented to or signed the proposed agreement voluntarily and fully understands the terms of the proposed agreement. Because section 2738(c)(3) of the Adoption Act, 23 Pa.C.S § 2738(c)(3), requires
a child who has attained 12 years of age to consent to the proposed agreement, best practices would
be to conduct an evidentiary hearing in these situations.
The court must find, either by reviewing the petition and exhibits or by conducting an evidentiary
hearing, the proposed agreement, as submitted, is in the child’s best interests. Since the statute does
not specify the standard of proof, this question will have to be determined by developing case law.
Section 2734 does specify that the proposed agreement may not be enforced unless the child who has
attained 12 years of age at the time of the agreement’s execution consents to the proposed agreement,
thereby suggesting that a proposed agreement cannot be found to be in the best interests of a child
who has attained 12 years of age and refuses to consent to the proposed agreement.
If the court finalizing the adoption will be different from the court that approved the Contact
Agreement, the Contact Agreement must be filed with the clerk of the court that signs and enters the
adoption decree under 23 Pa.C.S. §§ 2902, 2907. Neither the statute nor these Rules impose that
obligation on any one of the signatories to the Contact Agreement, except as provided in Rule 15.13.

entities as provided in subparagraph (f)(3) of Rule 15.12.
(d) Investigation. A petition for adoption shall be subject to investigation as
prescribed by local rules. The investigation report shall cover the matters alleged

Pa.C.S. §§ 2901-2902, 2904.
(1) If the petition for adoption contains averments requesting that the court

the petitioner has shown cause for failing to meet the statutory requirement and
has demonstrated that the adoptee’s needs and welfare nevertheless will be best
served by entering a decree of adoption.
(2) At the hearing on the petition for adoption, there shall be offered in
evidence a report, verified by the petitioners or counsel, setting forth the

(f) Adult—Change of Name. When the person to be adopted is over the age
of 18 years and desires to assume the surname of the adopting parents, evidence
showing compliance with the law relating to change of name must be introduced
before a decree will be made. See 54 Pa.C.S. § 702.
Explanatory Comment
The court, in its discretion, can dispense with any statutory requirement of the Adoption Act for
cause shown. See 23 Pa.C.S. § 2901. As a result, if petitioner is unable to satisfy all the prerequisites
or attach all the exhibits required by the Adoption Act, the adoption petition should not be dismissed
summarily. Rather, the petitioner should be afforded an opportunity to demonstrate why a statutory
requirement has not or cannot be met and why the proposed adoptee’s best interests nevertheless are
served by granting the adoption petition. In re Adoption of R.B.F. and R.C.F., 803 A.2d 1195 (Pa.
2002). If, upon reviewing the petition’s averments as to why a statutory requirement should be
waived, the court determines that cause has been demonstrated, the court can grant the relief requested
and dispense with the relevant statutory requirement without conducting a hearing. However, if the
court is not inclined to waive the pertinent statutory requirement, the petitioner is entitled to a hearing
and an opportunity to present evidence in support of the averments in the petition. See In re Adoption
of R.B.F. and R.C.F.
Subparagraph (c)(1) of this Rule applies if a parent’s parental rights are being terminated as part
of the hearing on the adoption petition. In such cases, the birth parent, putative father, or presumptive
father whose rights are being terminated must receive notice of the adoption hearing in accordance
with Rule 15.4. On the other hand, such persons do not need to be notified of the adoption hearing
if (i) he or she previously consented to the adoption and his or her consent was confirmed by the court
as provided in 23 Pa.C.S. § 2504 and Rule 15.9; (ii) he or she previously relinquished his or her
parental rights as provided in 23 Pa.C.S. §§ 2501, 2502 and Rule 15.7 or Rule 15.8 as applicable; or
(iii) his or her parental rights were involuntarily terminated by the court as provided in 23 Pa.C.S.
§§ 2511 et seq. and Rule 15.10.

Rule 15.14. Registration of Foreign Adoption Decree.
(a) Adopting parents may petition the court in the county of their residence
to register a foreign adoption decree so that it will be given full and final effect
in this Commonwealth. The petition and final decrees shall be in substantially the
form approved by the Supreme Court. See Appendix of Forms to these Rules. As
part of the Petition to Register Foreign Adoption Decree, an adopted child’s name
may be changed from that appearing on the foreign adoption decree if the
adopted child has not yet attained 12 years of age.
(b) A foreign adoption decree previously registered or otherwise finalized by
a court of this Commonwealth or of any other state may not be registered subsequently in another court of this Commonwealth.
(c) If the court determines that the foreign adoption decree can be registered,
the court shall sign the final decree and shall direct the clerk to enter the date of
the foreign adoption decree and identify the foreign court on the docket. The
clerk shall send Form No. HD01273F, Certificate of Adoption of a Foreign-Born
Child, and Form No. HD01275F, Statement of Citizenship and Residency, to the
Department of Health, Division of Vital Records, along with a copy of U.S. Government Form N-560, Certificate of Citizenship, or a copy of the child’s United
States passport, or both, if the documents have been provided by the adopting
parents. The clerk shall issue to the adopting parents a certificate of adoption in
accordance with 23 Pa.C.S. § 2907.
(d) If the court determines that the foreign adoption decree cannot be registered, the adopting parents shall proceed as applicable under the provisions set
forth in the Adoption Act, 23 Pa.C.S. §§ 2101 et seq., Rule 15.15 (specific to the
adoption of a foreign born child), and local rules.
(e) Adopting parents who are eligible to register the foreign adoption decree
under this Rule may, for any reason, proceed under Rule 15.15.
Explanatory Comment
Pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S. § 2908(b), as amended by Act 96 of 2006, a set of forms, consisting of a
Petition to Register Foreign Adoption Decree, Final Decrees approving and denying the Petition, and
detailed Instructions for the pro se petitioners are set forth in the Appendix to these Rules.
The petition should be filed with the clerk of the Orphans’ Court, except in Philadelphia County,
where it should be filed with the clerk of the Family Court Division. The petition and accompanying
documents, including the final decree, are confidential and should be impounded and withheld from
public inspection as provided in the Adoption Act, 23 Pa.C.S. §§ 2906, 2907, 2908(f), and 2911—
2937 and Rule 15.21.
The clerk shall make available to petitioner(s) the necessary Department of Health, Division of
Vital Records forms: Form No. HD01273F, Certificate of Adoption of a Foreign-Born Child; and
Form No. HD01275F, Statement of Citizenship and Residency.
A change of name from that appearing on the foreign adoption decree is permitted without the need
to comply with the procedures of 54 Pa.C.S. § 702 if the adopted child is younger than 12 years of
age. Cf. 23 Pa.C.S. § 2711(a)(1). If the foreign born adopted child is 12 years of age or older, then
the adopted child and parent(s) either may proceed under Rule 15.15 or follow the procedures set
forth in 54 Pa.C.S. § 702. In this latter situation, the adopted child and parent(s) would not be foreclosed by 54 Pa.C.S. § 702(b)(5)(ii) because the name change petition would not be in connection
with any adoption proceeding as the foreign adoption is full and final and therefore completed.
231 Rule 15.14 ORPHANS COURT RULES

(409812) No. 572 Jul. 22 Copyright  2022 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
A foreign born child who has been issued an IR-2, IR-3 or IH-3 United States Visa has had the
adoption proceeding fully completed in the foreign country and the foreign adoption decree only
needs to be registered here to be given the full force and effect of an adoption decree issued by this
Commonwealth. However, situations may arise that necessitate proceeding under Rule 15.15 even
though the foreign born child has been issued an IR-2, IR-3 or IH-3 United States Visa, such as the
inclusion of an incorrect birth year on the foreign adoption decree, or other personal family reasons.
Proceeding under Rule 15.15 is permitted; Rule 15.14 is not the exclusive means to obtain a Pennsylvania adoption decree and birth certificate for a foreign born adopted child.
Only one court, whether in this Commonwealth or another state, should exercise jurisdiction over
the foreign adoption decree. Thus, if the foreign adoption decree has been registered or otherwise
finalized in another state court, the adopting parents need not and should not register the foreign
adoption decree in this Commonwealth under this Rule. In similar fashion, if the foreign adoption
decree has been registered in this Commonwealth, and thereafter, another petitioner in this Commonwealth seeks to adopt this adopted individual, the subsequent proceeding will be a proceeding under
the applicable provisions of the Adoption Act, 23 Pa.C.S. §§ 2101 et seq. Such a situation could occur
when the adopted child is to be adopted by a stepparent after divorce or death of the original adopting
parents, or when, after termination of parental rights, the adopted child is to be adopted by Prospective Adoptive Parents different than the original adopting parents.
If the court determines that the foreign adoption is not a full and final adoption because the foreign
born child has been issued an IH-4 or IR-4 Visa, the adopting parent(s) shall proceed under subdivision (d) of this Rule. See also Rule 15.15.
Notice of the opportunity to enter into a Contact Agreement is not required to be given to the birth
parent(s) of a foreign born adopted child if such adopted child has been issued an IR-2, IR-3, or IH-3
United States Visa because the adoption was completed in the native country of the foreign born
adopted child pursuant to the laws and rules of that country. Under Rule 15.14, the court is merely
registering the foreign adoption decree, which evidences a completed adoption, and giving it the full
force and effect of a Pennsylvania adoption.

shall be in substantially the form approved by the Supreme Court. See Appendix
of Forms to these Rules.
(d) Judicial Review and Hearing.
(1) Scope of Review. The petition and accompanying documents filed
under this Rule shall be subject to review by the court as prescribed by the
Pennsylvania Adoption Act, 23 Pa.C.S. §§ 2101 et seq., Pennsylvania
Orphans’ Court Rules and local rules.
(2) Home Study and Investigation. The court may rely in whole or in part
upon a home study containing information required by 23 Pa.C.S. § 2530(b)
and an investigative report containing information required by 23 Pa.C.S.
§ 2535(b) previously commissioned in the foreign adoption proceeding without regard to when such reports were prepared. The court may in its discretion
require additional reports and investigations to be made in accordance with the
Pennsylvania Adoption Act and local rules.
(3) Original Documents, Decrees and Translations. All original documents, decrees and translations must be available for review by the court upon
request.
(4) Pre-adoption Requirements. In order to grant an adoption, the court
must be satisfied that the pre-adoption requirements set forth in 23 Pa.C.S.
§§ 2530—2535 have been met. If the Prospective Adoptive Parents or adopting parents were Pennsylvania residents at the time that the United States Visa
was issued to the foreign born child, the court may accept an IH or IR United
States Visa as proof that the pre-adoption requirements have been met.
(5) Proof that the Child is an Orphan. In order to grant an adoption, the
court must be satisfied that the adoptee is an orphan. The court may accept the
IH or IR United States Visa of the child as proof that the foreign born child is
an orphan.

child shall appear at the hearing. The court may in its discretion require the
presence of additional persons, including a representative of the intermediary.
(e) Disclosure of Fees and Costs. At the hearing on the petition for adoption,
there shall be offered in evidence a report, verified by the petitioners or counsel,
setting forth the amount of fees, expenses, and costs paid or to be paid to counsel, and any other fees, costs and expenses paid or to be paid to an intermediary
or to any other person or entity, in connection with the adoption of the foreign
born adoptee or adopted child. The court may request an itemization of any of
the amounts reported.
(f) Final Decree. After the hearing, the court shall determine if the adoption
of the foreign born child can be granted, and if so, the court shall enter a decree
as provided in 23 Pa.C.S. § 2902.
(g) Clerk of the Appropriate Court. Upon the filing of a decree granting the
adoption under this Rule, the clerk shall enter the decree and date of the decree
on the docket. The clerk shall send Form No. HD01273F, Certificate of Adoption
of a Foreign-Born Child, and Form No. HD01275F, Statement of Citizenship and
Residency, to the Department of Health, Division of Vital Records, along with a
copy of U.S. Government Form N-560, Certificate of Citizenship, or a copy of

in accordance with 23 Pa.C.S. § 2907.
(h) Only One Court May Assume Jurisdiction. Prospective Adoptive Parents
or adopting parent(s) shall not proceed under this Rule if the foreign adoption has

other state.
Explanatory Comment
Pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S. § 2908(e), as amended by Act 96 of 2006, a set of forms, consisting of a
Petition for Adoption of a Foreign Born Child, Report of Intermediary, Preliminary Decree, and Final
Decree are set forth in the Appendix to these Rules.
In most instances, the adopting parent(s) of a foreign born adopted child who has entered the
United States with an IR-2, IR-3 or IH-3 United States Visa will not need to proceed under Rule
15.15, but can register the foreign adoption decree pursuant to Rule 15.14. Situations may arise,
though, that necessitate proceeding under this Rule, such as the inclusion of an incorrect birth year on
the foreign adoption decree, or other personal family reasons. In these situations, adopting parent(s)
of a foreign born adopted child entering the United States with an IR-2, IR-3, or IH-3 United States
Visa may proceed under Rule 15.15; however, adopting parent(s) should be advised by counsel of the
additional costs, additional documentation required, and the delay caused by the need for a hearing.
If a foreign born adoptee has entered the United States with an IH-4 or IR-4 United States Visa,
the Prospective Adoptive Parents must proceed under Rule 15.15.
Only one state court, whether in this Commonwealth or another state, should exercise jurisdiction
over the registration of the foreign adoption decree or the completion of the adoption initiated in the
native country of the foreign born child. Thus, if the adoption has been finalized or the foreign adoption decree has been registered in another state court or in another court within this Commonwealth,
the adopting parents need not and should not proceed under this Rule. In similar fashion, if the adoption of the foreign born adopted child has been finalized in this Commonwealth, and thereafter,
another petitioner seeks to adopt this adopted individual, the subsequent proceeding will be a proceedADOPTIONS 231 Rule 15.15
15-29
(409815) No. 572 Jul. 22
ing under the applicable provisions of the Adoption Act, 23 Pa.C.S. §§ 2101 et seq. Such a situation
could occur when the adopted child is to be adopted by a stepparent after divorce or death of the
original adopting parents, or when, after termination of parental rights, the adopted child is to be
adopted by Prospective Adoptive Parents different than the adopting parents.
The documents referenced in Rule 15.15 should be filed with the clerk of the Orphans’ Court,
except in Philadelphia County, where they should be filed with the clerk of the Family Court Division. The petition and accompanying documents under this Rule, including the decree granting the
adoption, are confidential and should be impounded and withheld from public inspection as provided
in the Adoption Act, 23 Pa.C.S. §§ 2906, 2907, 2908(f), and 2911—2937 and Rule 15.21.
The clerk shall make available to the petitioners the necessary Department of Health, Division of
Vital Records forms: Form No. HD01273F, Certificate of Adoption of a Foreign-Born Child; and
Form No. HD01275F, Statement of Citizenship and Residency.
Notice of the opportunity to enter into a Contact Agreement is not required to be given to the birth
parent(s) of a foreign born child under either Rule 15.14 or Rule 15.15. If the adopted child has been
issued an IR-2, IR-3, or IH-3 United States Visa, then the adoption has been completed in the native
country of the foreign born adopted child pursuant to the laws and rules of that country. If the foreign
born child has been issued an IR-4 or IH-4 United States Visa, then the child has been determined to
be an orphan and the parental rights of the child’s parents have been terminated pursuant to the laws
of the child’s native country. The child thus has no legal parents to receive notice. See Rule
15.15(d)(5).

(a) Service of the Petition.
(1) The petitioner shall mail by first-class United States mail, postage prepaid a copy of any petition to modify, enforce, or discontinue the Contact

(C) any sibling of the adopted child who has continuing contact or
communication with the adopted child under the terms of the Contact Agreement; and
(D) all counsel who entered an appearance for any party, including
appearing as counsel or guardian ad litem for the adopted child, in the proceeding to approve the Contact Agreement or who have filed an entry of an
appearance in the current proceeding.
(2) A certificate of service shall be appended to the petition or filed separately and contemporaneously with the filing of the petition, stating the date
when the petition and the notice for filing a timely responsive pleading was
mailed by first-class, United States mail, postage prepaid, to those listed in
subparagraphs (1)(A)—(1)(D), as applicable.
(b) Service of Notice of the Hearing on the Petition.

effectively inform everyone entitled to notice of the date, time, and place of the
hearing.
(3) A certificate of service shall be presented to the court at the time of the
hearing. The certificate of service shall indicate the method of notice and shall
have attached thereto a copy of the notice, any affidavit by one who made personal service, any receipt cards for service sent by registered or certified mail,

Rule 15.17. Petition to Modify a Contact Agreement.
(a) General rule. By filing a petition under 23 Pa.C.S. § 2737 with the court
that entered the adoption decree, the adopting parents or the adopted child, if he
or she has attained 12 years of age, may seek to modify the Contact Agreement.
(b) Contents of petition to modify. The petition to modify the Contact Agreement shall set forth specific averments to establish the following facts:
(1) the age and birth date of the adopted child;
(2) the date when the court approved the Contact Agreement and that such
date was on or before the date of the adoption decree;
(3) whether the adopted child was then represented by a guardian ad litem;
(4) whether the adopted child either signed a separate written consent
agreeing to the Contact Agreement or signed the Contact Agreement as evidence of his or her consent, or that the adopted child had not attained 12 years
of age at the time of the execution of the Contact Agreement;
(5) whether there are siblings of the adopted child who have continuing
contact or communication with the adopted child under the terms of the Contact Agreement, and if so, the names, ages, and birth dates of such siblings, the
names of previously appointed guardians ad litem, if any, and who such guardian ad litem represented;
(6) a description of the proposed modification; and
(7) the reasons why the proposed modification will serve the needs, welfare and best interest of the adopted child.
(c) Exhibits. A copy of the Contact Agreement shall be attached to the petition.
(d) Service. The petition shall be served in accordance with Rule 15.16(a) and
notice of any scheduled hearing shall be provided in accordance with Rule
15.16(b).
(e) Decree. After a hearing, if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that modification of the Contact Agreement shall serve the needs, welfare
ADOPTIONS 231 Rule 15.17
15-31
(409817) No. 572 Jul. 22
and best interest of the adopted child, the court shall enter a decree so modifying
the Contact Agreement as necessary.
Explanatory Comment
Section 2741(b) provides that a guardian ad litem may be appointed to represent siblings who have
not attained 18 years of age in a proceeding to enforce or discontinue a Contact Agreement, but does
not specifically mention a proceeding to modify a Contact Agreement. 23 Pa.C.S. § 2741(b)(1).
However, the court has inherent powers to appoint a guardian ad litem whenever the court finds that
the interests of a minor are not adequately represented by others who are sui juris.
The evidentiary standard of clear and convincing evidence is statutorily mandated. See 23 Pa.C.S.
§ 2737(b).

(a) General Rule. By filing a petition under 23 Pa.C.S. § 2738, any party to
the Contact Agreement, the adopted child, or a sibling who has continuing contact or communication with the adopted child under the terms of the Contact
Agreement may seek to enforce the terms of the Contact Agreement.
(b) Contents of petition to enforce. The petition to enforce the Contact Agreement shall set forth specific averments to establish the following facts:
(1) the age and birth date of the adopted child;
(2) the date when the court approved the Contact Agreement and that such
date was on or before the date of the adoption decree;
(3) whether the adopted child was then represented by a guardian ad litem;
(4) whether the adopted child either signed a separate written consent
agreeing to the Contact Agreement or signed the Contact Agreement evidencing his or her consent, or that the adopted child had not attained 12 years of
age at the time of the execution of the Contact Agreement;
(5) whether there are siblings of the adopted child who have continuing
contact or communication with the adopted child under the terms of the Contact Agreement, and if so, the names, ages, and birth dates of such siblings, the
names of previously appointed guardians ad litem, if any, and who such guardians ad litem represented;

(d) The clerk where parental rights were terminated shall copy and forward
any statement of medical, personal, or social history information and forms
signed by a birth parent authorizing the release of identifying information, withholding the release of identifying information, or revoking previously given
authorizations as follows:
(1) a completed document in the form promulgated by the Department
shall be forwarded to the Pennsylvania Adoption Information Registry
(‘‘PAIR’’); and
(2) documents in whatever form or format shall be forwarded to the clerk
where the adoption decree has been entered if the court entering the adoption
decree is known or reasonably ascertainable from information in the court file
of the court that terminated parental rights.
(e) All documents described in subparagraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(4),
(c)(1), and (c)(3) shall be stamped with the date of receipt and an acknowledgement of receipt shall be sent to the individual who filed the document or the clerk
who sent the document.
Explanatory Comment
In order to avoid confusion, the term ‘‘court file,’’ rather than ‘‘court records,’’ is being used to
describe all documents that can be part of the court’s file because ‘‘court records’’ is statutorily
defined in 23 Pa.C.S. § 2911 to include only the petition, exhibits, reports, notes of testimony, decrees
and other papers pertaining to the judicial proceeding.
The statute directs that notice of the filing of a statement of medical, personal, or social history
information shall be given to ‘‘the individual who is at least 21 years of age and whom the information is intended to benefit, if known or identified in its records.’’ 23 Pa.C.S. § 2934(e)(2). Rule
15.22(g) provides the procedure for determining who is the person intended to be benefitted and how
notice of the filing of this Statement shall be provided to that intended beneficiary. Because the procedure in Rule 15.22(g) requires the filing of an initial request for information and because all
requests for information are filed through the clerk where the adoption decree is entered, it is that
court, and not the court that terminated parental rights, that shall review the statement of medical,
personal, or social history information, determining who is the individual intended to be benefitted
and whether and how information is to be provided to that individual. The clerk where parental rights
were terminated need only forward the statement of medical, personal, or social history information
to the clerk where the adoption decree is entered, if such court is known or can be readily identified
from items in the court file, and to the Pennsylvania Adoption Information Registry (‘‘PAIR’’) if the
completed Statement is in the form promulgated by the Department.
PAIR has a website (www.pagov-pair.org) and is requesting that any statement of medical, personal, or social history information be forwarded electronically in a .pdf format. The clerk shall forward the Statement to PAIR in a .pdf format as filed.
Notwithstanding the development of forms by the Department, the statute does not limit or restrict
what statements and forms the clerk can accept from birth parents, adopted individuals or their statutorily permissible representatives. Thus, in keeping with the spirit of the statute, clerks are encouraged to accept any document that reveals medical, personal, or social history information from a birth
parent, adopted individual, his or her statutorily permissible representative, descendants of a deceased
adopted individual, or survivors of a deceased birth parent. Likewise, clerks are encouraged to accept
and maintain any form or statement that reasonably can be construed as providing authorization or
consent to release identifying information, withholding such authorization or consent, or revoking a
prior authorization or consent given. The local courts are also free to adopt, through the promulgation
of local rules, their own forms for such uses. The Department has designed sample forms for the local
courts to use or to modify for use.
Because requests for identifying information are permitted to be filed only with the clerk where
the adoption decree is entered, only the clerk where the adoption decree is entered shall accept
ADOPTIONS 231 Rule 15.20
15-35
(409821) No. 572 Jul. 22
requests for non-identifying or identifying information and forms from the adopted individual authorizing the release of identifying information or withholding or revoking such authorization. See 23
Pa.C.S. § 2931(a). Despite the preceding sentence, the statute implies that the clerk where parental
rights were terminated must accept and maintain as part of its court file an authorization or consent
to release identifying information or any document withholding or revoking such authorization signed
by a birth parent. See 23 Pa.C.S. §§ 2933(a)(2)—(4). For this reason, Rule 15.20(d)(2) requires the
clerk where parental rights were terminated to forward a copy of any such signed authorization or
consent form or any document withholding or revoking authorization or consent to the clerk where
the adoption decree is entered, if known, thereby streamlining the efforts required by the court that
entered the adoption decree if a request for non-identifying or identifying information is later filed.
Finally, attorneys representing a party to an adoption proceeding or representing a child thereto
either as counsel or as a guardian ad litem are permitted to forward their records and information only
to the clerk where the adoption decree is entered. 23 Pa.C.S. § 2916. In this age of document management and given the judiciary’s limited financial and physical resources, the attorney representing
an agency may not deposit his or her records with the court as the agency already has record-keeping
requirements imposed by the Department. See 23 Pa.C.S. § 2915. Moreover, the court, by local rule,
may adopt procedures for attorneys forwarding documents to be retained in the court file, e.g., on a
disc, CD-ROM, or other electronic format. The court may charge reasonable fees for the acceptance
and retention of an attorney’s records. See 23 Pa.C.S. § 2913 (‘‘Any court. . .may charge reasonable fees for services provided under this chapter.’’).

(2) if the statement contains information about the adopted individual,
notice of its filing shall be sent to the birth parents, any legal guardian of a
birth parent, the parents of a deceased birth parent, and in limited circumstances to a birth sibling, but only if such person, at any time prior, had filed
a request for non-identifying or identifying information that was approved by
the court or was then denied by the court due only to the age of the requester
or the age of the subject of the request.
(3) Notice under this subparagraph (g) shall be provided to the individual
at the address listed on the request for non-identifying or identifying information or at the last updated address in the court file.

has been received, the date of its filing, and that the information contained in
the statement may be provided either in redacted form or with identifying
information upon the filing of new request for non-identifying or identifying
information.
(5) If a new request for non-identifying or identifying information is thereafter filed, the request shall contain the information required in paragraph (a)
and shall be processed as provided in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) as applicable.
(h) The court may permit reasonable fees to be charged for the filing, handling, and processing of any request for non-identifying or identifying information, and the fees may vary depending upon the time and efforts involved, the
extent of information made available to the requester, whether an Authorized
Representative is appointed by the court, and the extent of any search required.
Explanatory Comment
The handling of requests for non-identifying information, identifying information, or contact will
largely be dictated by local rule, custom and practice. Judges, law clerks, or court personnel experienced in adoptions should handle and address requests for non-identifying information and only an
appointed Authorized Representative duly trained by the Department should handle and address all
requests for identifying information. The statute has very specific rules as to who may request nonidentifying and identifying information and the age or existence of one individual may change the
requester’s right to have the request answered. See 23 Pa.C.S. § 2931(a). Further, the statute is specific about who can be the subject of a request. See 23 Pa.C.S. § 2931(b). Consequently, requests for
non-identifying and identifying information or contact should be reviewed by those trained in the law
or otherwise well versed in this statute.
The statutory deadlines set forth in 23 Pa.C.S. § 2932 for a court to notify a requester of the court’s
receipt of a non-identifying information request and to fulfill the request are not incorporated in this
Rule because these deadlines are procedural and compliance may not be practical in all cases. The
statutory deadlines are aspirational, rather than mandatory. Individual judges must view the specific
circumstances when enforcing a request for information and a non-response.
If the court believes that a request for identifying information or contact could cause physical or
emotional harm to the requestor or others, the court shall issue an order to this effect that can be
appealed by the requestor in accordance with 23 Pa.C.S. § 2936(b).

B. Each of the courts exercising dependency jurisdiction, as provided in the
Juvenile Act, 42 Pa.C.S. § 6301 et seq., may adopt local rules of procedure in

Comment
The Pennsylvania Rules of Juvenile Court Procedure are split into two categories: delinquency
matters and dependency matters. All delinquency matters are governed by Chapters One through Ten
(Rules 100—1099). All dependency matters are governed by Chapters Eleven through Twenty (Rules
1100—2099).
Unless specifically provided in these rules, the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure and the
Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure do not apply to dependency proceedings commenced pursuant to rule 1200 and 42 Pa.C.S. § 6301 et seq.
These rules govern proceedings when the Juvenile Act vests jurisdiction in the Court of Common
Pleas. See 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 6321 and 6302.
Each judicial district may promulgate local rules that follow the requirements of Rule 1121 and
Pa.R.J.A. 103.

The authority for rule-making is granted to the Supreme Court by Article V § 10(c) of the Pennsylvania Constitution, which states in part, ‘‘[t]he Supreme Court shall have the power to prescribe
general rules governing practice, procedure and the conduct of all courts . . . if such rules are consistent with this Constitution and neither abridge, enlarge nor modify the substantive rights of any litigant, nor affect the right of the General Assembly to determine the jurisdiction of any court or justice
of the peace, nor suspend nor alter any statute of limitation or repose. All laws shall be suspended to
the extent that they are inconsistent with rules prescribed under these provisions.’’

Comment:
In 2013, the definition of ‘‘child’’ was expanded to include those children who have requested the
court to resume jurisdiction after juvenile court supervision had been previously terminated. This rule
change followed the changes to the definition of ‘‘child’’ in the Juvenile Act pursuant to Act of July
5, 2012 (P.L. 880, No. 91). See 42 Pa.C.S. § 6302.

(422176) No. 605 Apr. 25 Copyright  2025 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
A party to the proceedings is not to function as the clerk of courts. Because the clerk of courts
maintains the official court record, this person is to remain neutral and unbiased by having no personal connection to the proceedings. The county agency is a party to the proceeding and is not to
function as the ‘‘Clerk of Courts.’’
The definition of ‘‘Clerk of Courts’’ should not necessarily be interpreted to mean the office of
clerk of courts as set forth in 42 Pa.C.S. § 102, but instead refers to that official who maintains the
official court record and docket regardless of the person’s official title in each judicial district. It is
to be determined locally which official is to maintain these records and the associated docket.
The county institution districts, as used in the definition of ‘‘county agency,’’ in counties of the
fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth classes were abolished pursuant to 16 P.S. § 2161. It is the
county commissioners’ duties in the counties of those classes to provide the children and youth social
service agency with the necessary services for the agency to provide care for the child. See 16 P.S.
§ 2168.
Under the term ‘‘court,’’ to determine if juvenile court hearing officers are permitted to hear cases,
see Rule 1187.
An ‘‘educational decision maker’’ is to be appointed by court order. The scope of the appointment
is limited to decisions regarding the child’s education. The educational decision maker acts as the
child’s spokesperson on all matters regarding education unless the court specifically limits the authority of the educational decision maker. The educational decision maker holds educational and privacy
rights as the child’s guardian for purposes of 20 U.S.C. § 1232g and 34 C.F.R. § 99.3. See also Rule
1147(C) for the duties and responsibilities of an educational decision maker.
The definition of ‘‘family finding’’ is derived from 67 Pa.C.S. § 7502.
Diligence is to include utilizing reasonable resources available when engaging in family finding,
never ceasing efforts until multiple relatives and kin are identified, and going beyond basic searching
tools by exploring alternative tools and methodologies. ‘‘Diligent efforts’’ is to include, but not limited to, interviews with immediate and extended family and kin, genograms, eco-mapping, case mining, cold calls, and specialized computer searches.
It is insufficient to complete only a basic computer search or attempt to contact known relatives at
a last-known address or phone number.
For multiple resources efforts that may be utilized, see Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Public Welfare, Office of Children, Youth and Families Bulletin, No. 3130-12-03, issued May
11, 2012, effective July 1, 2013; Seneca Family Finding, which may be found at www.familyfinding.
org, or Legal Services Initiative, diligent search packet, Statewide Adoption and Permanency
Network, which may be found at www.diakon-swan.org.
Supporting a child under the definition of ‘‘family finding’’ means any type of aid, including but
not limited to emotional, financial, physical, or psychological aid.
See also 67 Pa.C.S. §§ 7501 et seq. and 42 U.S.C. § 675 (Fostering Connections) to comply with
state and federal regulations.
For the family service plan, see 55 Pa. Code § 3130.61.
‘‘Health care’’ includes, but is not limited to, routine physical check-ups and examinations; emergency health care; surgeries; exploratory testing; psychological exams, counseling, therapy and treatment programs; drug and alcohol treatment; support groups; routine eye examinations and procedures;
teeth cleanings, fluoride treatments, fillings, preventative dental treatments, root canals, and other
dental surgeries; and any other examination or treatment relating to any physical, mental, and dental
needs of the child.
The definition for ‘‘Indian Child’’ originates from the Indian Child Welfare Act, 25 U.S.C. §§ 1901
et seq., and the Bureau of Indian Affairs regulations, 25 C.F.R. § 23.2.
A ‘‘juvenile probation officer’’ is an officer of the court. ‘‘Properly commissioned’’ as used in the
definition of a juvenile probation officer includes the swearing in under oath or affirmation and receipt
of a document, certificate, or order of the court memorializing the authority conferred upon the juvenile probation officer by the court.
A properly commissioned juvenile probation officer is vested with all the powers and duties set
forth in 42 Pa.C.S. § 6304, and the power to take a child into protective custody as a duly authorized
GENERAL PROVISIONS 237 Rule 1120

officer of the court pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 6324 unless the President Judge has limited such authority pursuant to Rule 195. See also 23 Pa.C.S. § 6315.
The definition of ‘‘law enforcement officer’’ does not give the power of arrest to any person who
is not otherwise given that power by law.
The ‘‘official court record’’ is to contain all court orders, court notices, docket entries, filed documents, evidence admitted into the record, and other court designated documents in each case. The
court may also designate any document to be a part of the record. It does not include items contained
in county agency’s records unless they are made a part of the official record by being filed with the
clerk of courts.
The term ‘‘petitioner’’ may include any person; however, if the person is not the county agency, an
application to file a petition pursuant to Rule 1320 is to be made. If the court, after a hearing, grants
the application, the applicant may file a petition.
The definition of ‘‘proceeding’’ includes all formal stages once a shelter care application has been
submitted or a petition has been filed, including all subsequent proceedings until supervision is terminated pursuant to Rule 1613.

Rule 1121. Local Rules.
The requirements for the promulgation and amendment of local procedural
rules for dependency proceedings are set forth in Pennsylvania Rule of Judicial
Administration 103(d).
Comment
Effective August 1, 2016, Pennsylvania Rule of Judicial Administration 103 was amended to consolidate and include all local rulemaking requirements. Accordingly, the rulemaking requirements
under Pa.R.J.C.P. 1121 for the promulgation and amendment of local procedural rules for dependency
proceedings were rescinded and replaced. All local rules previously promulgated in accordance with
the requirements of Pa.R.J.C.P. 1121 prior to rescission of this rule remain effective upon compilation
and publication pursuant to Pa.R.J.A. No. 103(d)(7).

Rule 1122. Continuances.
A. Generally. In the interests of justice, the court may grant a continuance
on its own motion or the motion of any party. On the record, the court shall identify the moving party and state its reasons for granting or denying the continuance.
B. Notice and rescheduling. If a continuance is granted, all persons summoned to appear shall be notified of the date, place, and time of the rescheduled
hearing.
Comment
Whenever possible, continuances should not be granted when they could be deleterious to the
safety or well-being of a party. The interests of justice require the court to look at all the circumstances, effectuating the purposes of the Juvenile Act, 42 Pa.C.S. § 6301, in determining whether a
continuance is appropriate.
A party seeking a continuance should notify the court and opposing counsel as soon as possible.
Whenever possible, given the time constraints, notice should be written.
Under paragraph (B), if a person is summoned to appear and the case is continued, the party is
presumed to be under the scope of the original summons and a new summons is not necessary.

C. Duration. A subpoena shall remain in force until the end of a proceeding.
D. Bench Warrant. If any subpoenaed person fails to appear for the hearing
and the court finds that sufficient notice was given, the judge may issue a bench
warrant pursuant to Rule 1140.
GENERAL PROVISIONS 237 Rule 1122
11-9
(414089) No. 584 Jul. 23
E. Parental notification.
1) Generally. If a witness is a minor, the witness’s guardian shall be
a) notified that the minor has been subpoenaed; and
b) provided with a copy of the subpoena.
2) Exception. Upon prior court approval and good cause shown, a subpoena may be served upon a minor without such notification to the guardian.
If and when necessary, request for such prior court approval may be obtained
ex parte.
Comment
A subpoena is used to order a witness to appear and a summons is issued to bring a party to the
proceeding.
A subpoena duces tecum is to set forth with particularity, the documents, records, or other papers
to be produced at the hearing. The items sought are to be relevant to the proceedings. See Rule 1340
on discovery, In re J.C., 412 Pa. Super. 369, 603 A.2d 627 (1992), and In re A.H., 763 A.2d 873 (Pa.
Super. Ct. 2000) for production of documents necessary to prepare for a hearing.
Prior to issuing a bench warrant for a minor, the judge should determine if the guardian of the witness was served. Nothing in these rules gives the guardians of witnesses legal standing in the matter
being heard by the court or creates a right for witnesses to have their guardians present. In addition,
lack of required notice to the guardian does not prevent the minor witness from testifying. See Rule
1140 for procedures on bench warrants.
For power to compel attendance, see 42 Pa.C.S. § 6333. Nothing in this rule prohibits the court
from holding a contempt hearing. See In re Crawford, 360 Pa. Super. 36, 519 A.2d 978 (1987) for
punishment of contempt (children). See also In re Griffin, 456 Pa. Super. 440, 690 A.2d 1192 (1997)
(foster parents), Janet D. v. Carros, 240 Pa. Super. 291, 362 A.2d 1060 (1976) (county agency), and
In re Rose, 161 Pa. Super. 204, 54 A.2d 297 (1947) (parents) for additional guidance on contempt for
other parties.
Any person may file a motion to quash the subpoena for a witness and/or for requested items. The
court is to rule on the motion prior to the production of the witness or the items.

Rule 1124. Summons.

1) be in writing;

2) set forth the date, time, and place of the hearing;
3) instruct the parties about the right to counsel; and
4) give a warning stating that the failure to appear for the hearing may
result in arrest.
B) Method of Service. The summons shall be served:
1) in-person; or
2) by certified mail, return receipt and first-class mail.
C) Exception to service. If service cannot be accomplished pursuant to paragraph (B), the party may move for a special order directing the method of service. The motion shall be accompanied by an affidavit stating the nature and
extent of the investigation which has been made to determine the whereabouts of
the person sought to be served and the reasons why service cannot be made.
D) Bench Warrant. If any summoned person fails to appear for the hearing
and the court finds that sufficient notice was given, the judge may issue a bench
warrant pursuant to Rule 1140.
Comment
A subpoena is used to order a witness to appear and a summons is issued to bring a party to the
proceeding.
In paragraph (D), this rule provides that a summoned person is to fail to appear and the court is to
find that sufficient notice was given before a bench warrant may be issued. The Juvenile Act, 42
Pa.C.S. § 6335(c), which provides for the issuance of arrest warrants if the child may abscond or may
not attend or be brought to a hearing, is suspended to the extent that it conflicts with this rule. See
Rule 1800 for suspensions.

Rule 1126. Defects in Form, Content, or Procedure.
A child shall not be released, nor shall a case be dismissed, because of a defect

hearing, and the defect is prejudicial to the rights of a party.

A petition, emergency custody authorization form, shelter care application, or warrant may be

custody authorization form, a new or amended petition, or the reissuance of process.

Rule 1127. Recording and Transcribing Juvenile Court Proceedings.
A. Recording. There shall be a recording of all dependency proceedings,
including proceedings conducted by juvenile court hearing officers, except as
provided in Rule 1242(B)(2).
B. Transcribing. The transcript shall be requested in accordance with
Pa.R.J.A. No. 4007.
C. Correcting or Modifying. At any time before an appeal is taken, the transcript may be corrected, and the record may be corrected or modified, in the same
manner as is provided by Pa.R.A.P. 1922(c) and Pa.R.A.P. 1926, respectively.
Comment
Some form of record or transcript is necessary to permit meaningful consideration of claims of
error and effective appellate review. In re J.H., 788 A.2d 1006 (Pa. Super. 2001). See, e.g., Pa.R.A.P.
1922, 1923, 1924; Commonwealth v. Fields, 387 A.2d 83 (Pa. 1978); Cmmonwealth v. Shields, 383
A.2d 844 (Pa. 1978). This rule is intended to provide a mechanism to ensure appropriate recording
and transcribing of court proceedings. Pursuant to Rule 1800, 42 Pa.C.S. § 6336(c) was suspended
only to the extent that all proceedings are to be recorded, except as provided in Rule 1242(B)(2). Full
minutes are not recordings. This change was to effectuate effective appellate review.
The rule is intended to apply to all dependency proceedings and to ensure all proceedings are
recorded, including proceedings before juvenile court hearing officers, except for shelter care hearings.
Paragraph (B) is not intended to preclude the court from ordering a transcript in the absence of a
request.
Paragraph (C) provides a method for correcting transcripts and correcting or modifying the record
before an appeal is taken by incorporating Pa.R.A.P. 1922(c) and Pa.R.A.P. 1926, which otherwise
apply only after an appeal has been taken.

Rule 1128. Presence at Proceedings.
A) General Rule. All parties, including the child, shall be present at any proceeding unless the exceptions of paragraph (B) apply.
B) Exceptions.
1) Absence from Proceedings. The court may proceed in the absence of a
party upon good cause shown except that in no case shall a hearing occur in
the absence of a child’s attorney. If a child has a guardian ad litem and legal
counsel, both attorneys shall be present.
2) Exclusion from Proceedings. A party may be excluded from a proceeding only for good cause shown. If a party is so excluded, counsel for the party
shall be permitted to be present.
C) Advanced Communication Technology. A child or guardian may appear by
utilizing advanced communication technology pursuant to Rule 1129.
D) Court-Ordered Appearance. The court may order any person having the
physical custody or control of a child to bring the child to any proceeding.
Comment
In no case is a proceeding to occur in the absence of the child’s attorney. The court has discretion
whether to proceed if the court finds that a party received proper notice of the hearing and has willfully failed to appear.
Requiring the child’s attorney to be present pursuant to paragraph (B)(2) protects the child’s interest if the proceeding is conducted in the child’s absence. However, unless good cause is shown by
individual circumstances, a child should be present in court. See also Pa.R.J.C.P. 1129(A)(2) (child
shall appear in person at least every six months unless presence is excused). It is important that all
children, including infants, appear in court so the court can observe the interaction between the caregiver and child and observe the child’s development and health. Because a child may feel uncomfortable while attending proceedings, the court should take measures to ensure that the child understands
the courtroom to be a place of safety and security.
Ensuring a child appears in court on a regular basis is critical because the court oversees the child
and is to ensure his or her care, protection, safety, and wholesome mental and physical development.
However, the court may ask that the child be removed from the courtroom during sensitive testimony.
See In re Adoption of S.B.B. and E.P.R., 539 A.2d 883 (Pa. Super. 1988).
Nothing in these rules creates a right of a child to have his or her guardian present. See 42 Pa.C.S.

Rule 1129. Appearance by Advanced Communication Technology.
A. Generally.
1) The child, guardian, or a witness may appear at a proceeding by utilizing advanced communication technology pursuant to Rules 1140, 1242, 1406,
1512, and 1608.
2) At a minimum, the child shall appear in person at least every six
months unless as otherwise provided by Rule 1128.
B. Counsel.
1) The child or guardian shall be permitted to confer with counsel before
entering into an agreement to appear utilizing advanced communication technology.
2) The child or guardian shall be permitted to communicate fully and
confidentially with counsel immediately prior to and during the proceeding.
Comment
Paragraph (A) requires that every child is to appear in person at least every six months. There may
be instances in which the child is excused from attending pursuant to Rule 1128.
This rule is not intended to compel the use of advanced communication technology but rather permit appearance by telephone or by a system providing two-way simultaneous audio-visual communication. Advanced communication technology may be utilized for the convenience for witnesses; efficient use of resources; or when a party or witness has an illness, is incarcerated, or is otherwise in a
remote location. See Rules 1140, 1242, 1406, 1512, and 1608 for specific requirements for the use of
advanced communication technology.
Additionally, special care is to be taken when utilizing advanced communication technology to
prevent disclosure of sensitive information to unauthorized persons and entities or to prevent a breach
of confidentiality between a party and the party’s attorney.
Pursuant to paragraph (B)(1), the child or guardian is to be permitted to confer with counsel prior
to agreeing to a proceeding utilizing advanced communication technology. Counsel includes legal
counsel and/or the guardian ad litem. Pursuant to paragraph (B)(2), the child or guardian is permitted
to confer with counsel privately prior to and during the proceedings. The child is to be afforded all
the same rights as if the hearing was held with all parties present in the courtroom.

Rule 1133. Motion to Intervene.
A. Contents. The motion to intervene shall include:
1) the name and address of the person moving to intervene;
2) the relationship of the intervening person to the child;
3) the contact between the child and the intervening person;
4) the grounds on which intervention is sought; and
5) the request sought.
B. Action by court. Upon the filing of a motion to intervene and after a hearing, the court shall enter an order granting or denying the motion.
Comment
Under paragraph (B), a motion may be denied if, among other reasons, there are insufficient
grounds for the motion, the interest of the movant is already adequately represented, the motion for
intervention was unduly delayed, or the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication
of dependency or the rights of the parties.
To move for intervention in a dependency case, a person is to show that the interest is substantial,
direct, and immediate. See, e.g., South Whitehall Township Police Serv. v. South Whitehall Township,
521 Pa. 82, 555 A.2d 793 (1989).
Standing is conferred upon a person if the person cares for or controls the child or is accused of
abusing the child. In re J.P., 832 A.2d 492 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2003); In re L.J., 456 Pa. Super. 685, 691

Comment
Pursuant to paragraph (A), the judge is to ensure that the person received sufficient notice of the
hearing and failed to attend. The judge may order that the person be served in-person or by certified
mail, return receipt. The judge may rely on first-class mail service if additional evidence of sufficient
notice is presented. For example, testimony that the person was told in person about the hearing is
sufficient notice. Before issuing a bench warrant, the judge should determine if the guardian was
notified.
Under Rule 1800, 42 Pa.C.S. § 6335(c) was suspended only to the extent that it is inconsistent
with this rule. Under paragraph (A)(1), the judge is to find a subpoenaed or summoned person failed
to appear and sufficient notice was given to issue a bench warrant. The fact that the party or witness
may abscond or may not attend or be brought to a hearing is not sufficient evidence for a bench warrant. The normal rules of procedure in these rules are to be followed if a child is detained. See Chapter Twelve.
Paragraph (A)(3) does not preclude the issuance of a bench warrant for a case in which the child
is subject to the jurisdiction of the dependency and delinquency court, see Rule 141 (Bench Warrants
for Absconders), or an order for protective custody. Nor does the paragraph preclude judicial inquiry
into efforts to locate a missing dependent child.
In paragraphs (B)(1)(c)(i), (C)(1)(c)(i), & (C)(4)(e)(i), ‘‘other placement as deemed appropriate by
the judge’’ does not include a detention facility if a child is only alleged to be dependent because the
use of detention facilities for dependent children is strictly prohibited. See 42 Pa.C.S. § 6302 &
6327(e).
Under paragraphs (B)(2) and (B)(4), a party taken into custody pursuant to a bench warrant is to
have a hearing within seventy-two hours regardless of where the party is found. See Rule 1242(D).
Pursuant to paragraph (B)(4), the party may be detained out-of-county until transportation arrangements can be made.
Pursuant to paragraph (C)(4)(b), a witness is to be brought before an out-of-county judge by the
next business day unless the witness can be brought before the judge who issued the bench warrant
within this time. When the witness is transported back to the county of issuance within seventy-two
hours of the execution of the bench warrant, the witness is to be brought before the judge who issued
the bench warrant by the next business day. See paragraph (C)(4)(f).
Pursuant to paragraph (E)(4), the bench warrant is to be vacated after the return of the warrant is
executed so the party or witness is not taken into custody on the same warrant if the party or witness
is released. ‘‘Vacated’’ is to denote that the bench warrant has been served, dissolved, executed, dismissed, canceled, returned, or any other similar language used by the judge to terminate the warrant.
The bench warrant is no longer in effect once it has been vacated.

Throughout these rules, the ‘‘child’’ is the subject of the dependency proceedings. When a witness
or another party is under the age of eighteen, the witness or party is referred to as a ‘‘minor.’’ When
‘‘minor’’ is used, it may include a child. This distinction is made to differentiate between children who
are alleged dependents and other minors who are witnesses. See also Rule 1120 for the definitions of

PART B(1). EDUCATION AND HEALTH OF CHILD
Rule 1145. Application or Motion for Examination and Treatment of a
Child.
A. Pre-petition treatment. Prior to the filing of a dependency petition, an
application to the court may be made to treat a child when prompt treatment is
necessary.
B. Post-petition examination and treatment. After a petition has been filed, a
motion for examination and treatment of a child may be filed.
Comment
The term ‘‘application’’ is used in paragraph (A) of this rule. An application is to be made to the
court if there is no formal court action pending. Once a dependency petition is filed, a motion, as provided in paragraph (B), is the proper course of action for seeking examination and treatment of a
child. All parties are notified and copied on all motions. The procedures of Rule 1344 are to be followed. See Rule 1344.
It should be noted that paragraph (A) only relates to treatment of a child when prompt treatment
is necessary.
Pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 6339(b), the court may order the child to be examined at a suitable place
by a physician or psychologist and may also order medical or surgical treatment of a child who is
suffering from a serious physical condition or illness, which in the opinion of a licensed physician,
requires prompt treatment, even if the guardian has not been given notice of a hearing, is not available, or without good cause informs the court of his refusal to consent to the treatment. 42 Pa.C.S.
§ 6339(b). In addition, 42 Pa.C.S. § 6357 provides a custodian to whom legal custody has been given
GENERAL PROVISIONS 237 Rule 1145
11-21
(407939) No. 568 Mar. 22
by the court has the right to the physical custody of the child, the right to determine the nature of the
care and treatment of the child, including ordinary medical care and the right and duty to provide for
the care, protection, training, and education, and the physical, mental, and moral welfare of the child.
An award of legal custody shall be subject to the conditions and limitations of the order and to the
remaining rights and duties of the parents or guardian of the child as determined by the court. 42
Pa.C.S. § 6357.
If a child has been adjudicated dependent, the court may order that the county agency participate
in the treatment plan of the child as necessary to protect the health, safety, or welfare of the child,
including discussions with the individual, facility, or program providing treatment, and the child or
the child’s guardian in furtherance of the disposition. 42 Pa.C.S. § 6352.1.
Under paragraph (B), if the legal custodian is the county agency, the county agency is to comply
with the regulations of 55 Pa. Code §§ 3130.91 and 3680.52.

Upon receiving written notice of a hearing regarding a citation or complaint for
truancy against a child or a person in parental relation pursuant to 24 P.S.
§ 13-1333.1 when the child is the subject of a dependency proceeding, the
county agency shall serve a copy of the notice upon the dependency court and
parties.
Comment
Pursuant to 24 P.S. § 13-1333.2(b)(1), the court in which a truancy citation or complaint is filed
shall provide the county agency with written notice of the hearing. For definition of ‘‘person in
parental relation,’’ see 24 P.S. § 13-1326.
The President Judge may adopt local rules coordinating jurisdiction and proceedings between the
judge of the court where the citation or complaint was filed and the dependency court judge. Coordination may include, but is not limited to, the entry of an order staying the truancy proceeding for further consideration by the dependency court.

A. Generally. At any proceeding or upon motion, the court shall appoint an
educational decision maker for the child if it determines that:
1) the child has no guardian; or
2) the court, after notice to the guardian and an opportunity for the guardian to be heard, has made a determination that it is in the child’s best interest
to limit the guardian’s right to make decisions regarding the child’s education.
B. Notice of hearings. The educational decision maker shall receive notice of
all proceedings.

11-22
(407940) No. 568 Mar. 22 Copyright  2022 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
C. Duties and responsibilities. The educational decision maker shall:
1) make appropriate inquiries and take appropriate actions to ensure that:
a) issues concerning the child’s educational stability are addressed;
b) school discipline matters are addressed;
c) the child is receiving appropriate education that will allow the child
to meet state standards, including any necessary services concerning special
education in the least restrictive environment, or remedial services;
d) the child, who is fourteen years of age or older, is receiving the
necessary educational services to transition to successful adulthood;
e) the child, who is receiving services concerning special education, is
engaged in transition planning with the school entity beginning no later than
the school year in which the child turns fourteen; and
f) the child, who is aging out of care within ninety days, has a transition plan that addresses the child’s educational needs, and if applicable, the
plan is coordinated with the child’s transition planning concerning special
education under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.
2) address the child’s educational needs by:
a) meeting with the child at least once and as often as necessary to
make decisions regarding education that are in the child’s best interests;
b) participating in special education and other meetings, and making
decisions regarding all matters affecting the child’s educational needs in a
manner consistent with the child’s best interests;
c) making any specific recommendations to the court relating to:
i) the timeliness and appropriateness of the child’s educational placement;
ii) the timeliness and appropriateness of the child’s transitional planning; and
iii) services necessary to address the child’s educational needs;
d) appearing and testifying at court hearings when necessary; and
e) having knowledge and skills that ensure adequate representation of
the child.
Comment
A child in dependent care is to have a clearly identified, legally authorized educational decision
maker. This is a particular concern for highly mobile children whose caregivers may change and
whose guardian may be unavailable. An educational decision maker’s responsibilities may include,
but are not limited to: ensuring educational stability as mandated by 42 U.S.C. §§ 675(1)(G) and
11431 et seq.; ensuring prompt enrollment in a new school as required pursuant to 22 Pa. Code
§ 11.11(b); facilitating access to a full range of school programs; advocating for the child in school
discipline matters; ensuring meaningful transition planning as required by 42 Pa.C.S. § 6351 and 42
U.S.C. § 675(5)(H); and for a child eligible for special education, ensuring access to appropriate services including transition planning beginning no later than age fourteen. See 24 P. S. §§ 13-1371,
13-1372, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400 et seq. See paragraph (A) and (C).
An educational decision maker appointed pursuant to this rule who represents a child who is also
adjudicated delinquent is to review Rule 147.
A court is not to appoint an educational decision maker if there is a parent, guardian, or other
authorized person (e.g., foster parent, relative with whom the child lives or surrogate parent appointed
GENERAL PROVISIONS 237 Rule 1147
11-23
(407941) No. 568 Mar. 22
under the IDEA) who is competent, willing, and available to make decisions regarding the child’s
education and who is acting in the child’s best interest regarding all educational matters. See Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (‘‘IDEA’’), 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400 et seq. (2004). A court should
limit the authority of a parent to make decisions regarding education only to the extent necessary to
protect the child’s interest and can reinstate the parent or change the educational decision maker at
any time.
Unless limited by the court in its appointment order, an educational decision maker: 1) is responsible for making all decisions concerning education, including special education, for the child; and 2)
can consent to or prohibit the release of information from the child’s school records as a parent in
accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1232g and 34 C.F.R.
§ 99.3 (1974). The educational decision maker may be a family member, a family friend, a mentor,
a foster parent, a former foster parent, a Court Appointed Special Advocate, or, if an educational decision maker for special education is not needed, a child welfare professional. Except as otherwise provided by the IDEA, it is within the discretion of the court to appoint an educational decision maker
and whom to appoint. In all cases, however, an educational decision maker appointed by the court
should be familiar with a child’s educational rights or is to agree to be trained regarding these issues.
If the child is or may be eligible for special education, an educational decision maker is to be
appointed in accordance with the standards and procedures set forth in federal and state laws concerning special education. See IDEA, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400, 1401(23), and 1415(b)(2); 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.30,
300.45, and 300.519. The IDEA recognizes a court’s authority to appoint persons to make decisions
concerning special education for a child. However, such decision makers cannot be the State or
employees of any agency that is involved in the education or care of the child. 34 C.F.R.
§ 300.519(c), (d)(2)(i).
The educational decision maker should refer to the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 (P. L. 110-351) and the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, 42
U.S.C. §§ 11431 et seq. (1989) for guidance in educational stability. Specifically, the educational
decision maker is to: a) ensure the right to remain in the same school regardless of a change in placement when it is in the child’s best interest; b) facilitate immediate enrollment in a new school when
a school change is in the child’s best interest; and c) ensure that school proximity is considered in all
placement changes, 42 U.S.C. §§ 675(1)(G) and 11431 et seq.
The educational decision maker is to also ensure: a) that the child receives an appropriate education, including, as applicable, any necessary special education, early intervention, or remedial services; see 24 P.S. §§ 13-1371, 13-1372, 55 Pa. Code § 3130.87, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400 et seq.; b) that
the child receives educational services necessary to support the child’s transition to successful adulthood if the child is fourteen or older pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 6351(F)(8); and c) that the educational
decision maker participates in the development of a transition plan that addresses the child’s educational needs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 675(5)(H) if the child will age out of care within ninety days.
The authority of the court to appoint an educational decision maker is derived from the broad powers of the court to issue orders that ‘‘provide for the care, protection, safety, and wholesome mental

child who is eligible for special education has an active parent or other identified person who can
participate in the process concerning special education. See IDEA, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1401(23) and

Rule 1148. Educational Stability and Placement.
A. General Rule. Any order resulting in the placement of a child or a change
in placement shall address the educational stability of the child.
B. School of Origin. A child in placement shall remain in their school of origin unless the court finds remaining in the school of origin is not in the child’s
best interest. If the court finds that it is not in the best interest of the child to
remain in the school of origin, then the court may order the child to be enrolled
in another school that best meets the child’s needs.
C. Another School. If a court orders the child to be enrolled in another school
pursuant to paragraph (B), then the child shall attend a public school unless the
court finds that a public school is not in the best interest of the child.
Comment
This rule is intended to apply at any point in a dependency proceeding when the child is in placement, including pre-dispositional placement and post-dispositional modification of a dependent child’s
placement. This rule is intended to complement rather than supersede the requirements of Rule
1512(D)(1)(i).
In paragraph (B), the best interest determination should be based on factors including the appropriateness of the current educational setting considering the child’s needs and the proximity of the
school of origin relative to the placement location. This paragraph is not intended to usurp the administrative process contemplated by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended,
20 U.S.C. § 6311(g)(1)(E). This paragraph is intended to facilitate educational stability while the
child remains under the jurisdiction of the Juvenile Court and to codify the presumption that a child
is to remain in their school of origin absent evidence that it is not in the child’s best interest to do so.
In paragraph (C), circumstances indicating that it may not be in the best interest for the child to
attend a public school include the security and safety of the child and treatment needs. Paragraph (C)
is intended to codify the presumption that a child is to attend public school while in placement absent
evidence demonstrating that it is not in the best interest of the child to do so. The bundling of residential services and educational services should not be permitted without a court order authorizing
such.
A court may consider an Individualized Education Program, Service Agreement, or administrative
determination in making findings pursuant to this Rule.

Rule 1149. Family Finding.
A. Court’s inquiry and determination.
1) The court shall inquire as to the efforts made by the county agency to
comply with the family finding requirements pursuant to 67 Pa.C.S. §§ 7501
et seq.
2) The court shall place its determinations on the record as to whether the
county agency has reasonably engaged in family finding.
B. Discontinued family finding. Family finding may be discontinued only if,
after a hearing, the court has made a specific determination that:
1) continued family finding no longer serves the best interests of the child;
2) continued family finding is a threat to the child’s safety; or
3) the child is in a preadoptive placement and the court proceedings to
adopt the child have been commenced pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S. Part III (relating
to adoption).
C. Resuming family finding. The county agency shall resume family finding
when the court determines that resuming family finding:
1) is best suited to the safety, protection and physical, mental, and moral
welfare of the child; and
2) does not pose a threat to the child’s safety.
Comment:
Pursuant to paragraph (A), efforts by the county agency may include, but are not limited to whether
the county agency is or will be: a) searching for and locating adult relatives and kin; b) identifying
and building positive connections between the child and the child’s relatives and kin; c) when appropriate: i) supporting the engagement of relatives and kin in social service planning and delivery of
services; and ii) creating a network of extended family support to assist in remedying the concerns
that led to the child becoming involved with the county agency; d) when possible, maintaining family
connections; and e) when in the best interests of the child and when possible, keeping siblings
together in care.
The extent to which the county agency is involved in the case when a child is still in the home is
dependent on several variables and specific to each case. In some instances, the county agency is more
involved and actively engaged in family finding because the child needs support services or could be
removed from the home. The search in these instances is used to find resources to help keep the child
in the home by preventing removal, or to find resources if removal becomes necessary.
See 67 Pa.C.S. § 7501 for legislative intent regarding family finding and promotion of kinship
care.
Family finding is required for every child when a child is accepted for services by the county
agency. See 67 Pa.C.S. § 7503. It is best practice to find as many kin as possible for each child. These
kin may help with care or support for the child. The county agency should ask the guardian, the child,
and siblings about relatives or other adults in the child’s life, including key supporters of the child or
guardians.
Specific evidence should be provided indicating the steps taken to locate and engage relatives and
kin. See Comment to Rule 1120 regarding diligent efforts considerations for locating relatives and kin.
When considering the method by which relatives and kin are engaged in service planning and delivery, courts and the parties are encouraged to be creative. Strategies of engagement could include, but
are not limited to, inviting relatives and kin to: 1) be involved in a family group decision making
conference, family team conferencing, or other family meetings aimed at developing or supporting the
family service plan; 2) assist with visitation; 3) assist with transportation; 4) provide respite or child
care services; or 5) provide actual kinship care.
Pursuant to paragraph (A)(2), the court is to place its determinations on the record as to whether
the county has reasonably engaged in family finding. The level of reasonableness is to be determined
by the length of the case and time the county agency has had to begin or continue the process. For
example, at the shelter care hearing, the county agency should at least ask the question whether there
is family or kin available as a resource. The initial removal of the child is the most critical time in the
237 Rule 1149 JUVENILE RULES
11-26
(414838) No. 587 Oct. 23 Copyright  2023 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
case. Potential trauma should be considered and ameliorated by family finding efforts as much as
possible. Phone calls at this time are reasonable. However, at the dispositional or permanency hearings, the county agency has had more time to engage in a more thorough diligent search as discussed
infra. See also Rule 1120 and its Comment.
The court’s inquiry and determination regarding family finding should be made at each stage of
the case, including, but not limited to the entry of an order for protective custody, shelter care hearing, adjudicatory hearing, dispositional hearing, and permanency hearing. See Rules 1210, 1242,
1408, 1409, 1512, 1514, 1515, 1608, 1609, 1610, and 1611, and their Comments.
Paragraph (B)(3) is meant to include notice of intent to adopt, petition to adopt, or voluntary relinquishment of parental rights, or consent to adopt.

PART B(2). COUNSEL
Rule 1150. Attorneys—Appearances and Withdrawals.
A. Appearances.
1) The Guardian ad litem and counsel for each party, except under paragraph (A)(3), shall file an entry of appearance with the clerk of courts promptly
after being retained and serve a copy on all other parties.
a) If a firm name is entered, the name of the individual lawyer who is
designated as being responsible for the conduct of the case shall be entered.
b) The entry of appearance shall include the attorney’s address, phone
number, and attorney ID number.
2) When counsel is appointed pursuant to Rule 1151 (Assignment of
Counsel), the filing of the appointment order shall enter the appearance of
appointed counsel.
3) The president judge of each judicial district may enter an order stating
that the specified Solicitor’s appearance is automatically entered in every
dependency case unless another attorney’s appearance is entered pursuant to
paragraph (A)(1).
B. Duration. Once an appearance is entered or the court assigns counsel for
the child, counsel shall represent the child until the closing of the dependency
case, including any proceeding upon direct appeal and permanency review, unless
permitted to withdraw pursuant to paragraph (C).
C. Withdrawals.
1) Upon motion, counsel shall be permitted to withdraw only:
a) by order of the court for good cause shown; or
b) if new counsel has entered an appearance in accordance with paragraph (A).
2) A motion to withdraw shall be:
a) filed with the clerk of courts, and a copy concurrently served on the
other parties’ attorneys, or the party, if unrepresented; or
b) made orally on the record in open court in the presence of the parties.

Comment
Paragraph (A)(3) allows the Solicitor to be automatically entered in the record as counsel for the
agency. The order is to include the attorney’s address, phone number, and attorney ID number.
Under paragraph (C), withdrawal is presumed when a court’s jurisdiction is terminated because the
child reaches the age of twenty-one. See 42 Pa.C.S. § 6302.
Under paragraph (C)(1)(a), a court can terminate an attorney’s representation if there is good cause
shown. The court should allow an attorney to withdraw from a case for good cause if the standards
for termination of representation, as provided for in the Rules of Professional Conduct 1.16, are met.
Under paragraph (C)(1)(b), because the county agency will be on notice of the identity of the new
attorney, the agency should comply with the discovery requirements of Rule 1340.
Under paragraph (C)(2), counsel is to file a motion to withdraw in all cases. Counsel’s obligation
to represent a party, whether as retained or appointed counsel, remains until leave to withdraw is
granted by the court. See e.g., Com. v. Librizzi, 810 A.2d 692 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2002). The court is to
make a determination of the status of the case before permitting counsel to withdraw. Although there
are many factors considered by the court in determining whether there is good cause to permit the
withdrawal of counsel, when granting leave, the court should determine if new counsel needs to be
appointed, and that the change in attorneys will not delay the proceedings or prejudice the party, particularly concerning time limits.
See Rule 1167 for service of court orders.
See also Rule 1613 for termination of court supervision.
See the Comment to Rule 1634 for assisting children in filing resumption of jurisdiction motions.
It is best practice for the court to appoint the guardian ad litem or legal counsel who was previously
assigned to the child as legal counsel in the re-opened case. If there are extenuating circumstances
preventing the attorney from representing the child, the attorney should make this known at the time
of the filing of the motion for resumption of jurisdiction so the court can assign a new attorney.

Rule 1151. Assignment of Guardian Ad Litem and Counsel.
A. Guardian ad litem for child. The court shall assign a guardian ad litem to
represent the legal interests and the best interests of the child if a proceeding has
been commenced pursuant to Rule 1200 alleging a child to be dependent who:
1) is without proper parental care or control, subsistence, education as
required by law, or other care or control necessary for the physical, mental or
emotional health, or morals;
2) has been placed for care or adoption in violation of law;
3) has been abandoned by parents, guardian, or other custodian;
4) is without a parent, guardian or legal custodian; or
5) is born to a parent whose parental rights with regard to another child
have been involuntarily terminated under 23 Pa.C.S. § 2511 (relating to
grounds for involuntary termination) within three years immediately preceding
the date of birth of the child and conduct of the parent poses a risk to the
health, safety, or welfare of the child.
B. Counsel for child. The court shall appoint legal counsel for a child:
1) if a proceeding has been commenced pursuant to Rule 1200 alleging a
child to be dependent who:
a) while subject to compulsory school attendance is habitually and
without justification truant from school;
b) has committed a specific act or acts of habitual disobedience of the
reasonable and lawful commands of the child’s guardian and who is ungovernable and found to be in need of care, treatment, or supervision;
c) is under the age of ten years and has committed a delinquent act;
d) has been formerly adjudicated dependent, and is under the jurisdiction of the court, subject to its conditions or placements and who commits an
act which is defined as ungovernable in paragraph (B)(1)(b);
e) has been referred pursuant to section 6323 (relating to informal
adjustment), and who commits an act which is defined as ungovernable in
paragraph (B)(1)(b); or
f) has filed a motion for resumption of jurisdiction pursuant to Rule
1634; or
2) upon order of the court.
C. Counsel and Guardian ad litem for child. If a child has legal counsel and
a guardian ad litem, counsel shall represent the legal interests of the child and the
guardian ad litem shall represent the best interests of the child.
D. Time of appointment.
1) Child in custody. The court shall appoint a guardian ad litem or legal
counsel immediately after a child is taken into protective custody and prior to
any proceeding.
2) Child not in custody. If the child is not in custody, the court shall
appoint a guardian ad litem or legal counsel for the child when a dependency
petition is filed.
GENERAL PROVISIONS 237 Rule 1151
11-29
(387409) No. 514 Sep. 17
E. Counsel for other parties. If counsel does not enter an appearance for a
party, the court shall inform the party of the right to counsel prior to any proceeding. If counsel is requested by a party in any case, the court shall assign counsel
for the party if the party is without financial resources or otherwise unable to
employ counsel. Counsel shall be appointed prior to the first court proceeding.
Comment
See 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 6302, 6311, and 6337.
The guardian ad litem for the child may move the court for appointment as legal counsel and
assignment of a separate guardian ad litem, when, for example, the information that the guardian ad
litem possesses gives rise to the conflict and can be used to the detriment of the child. To the extent
42 Pa.C.S. § 6311(b)(9) is inconsistent with this rule, it is suspended. See Rule 1800. See also
Pa.R.P.C. 1.7 and 1.8.
Pursuant to paragraph (B)(1)(f), the court is to appoint legal counsel when a motion for resumption
of jurisdiction has been filed. It is best practice to appoint the guardian ad litem or legal counsel who
was previously assigned to the child as legal counsel.
Under paragraph (C), legal counsel represents the legal interests of the child and the guardian ad
litem represents the best interests of the child.
Nothing in these rules anticipates that a guardian ad litem for an adult is to be appointed by these
rules. For appointment of a guardian of the person, see 20 Pa.C.S. § 5501 et seq. and Pa.O.C. Rules
14.2—14.5.
Pursuant to paragraph (E), the court is to inform all parties of the right to counsel if they appear
at a hearing without counsel. If a party is without financial resources or otherwise unable to employ
counsel, the court is to appoint counsel prior to the proceeding. Because of the nature of the proceedings, it is extremely important that every ‘‘guardian’’ has an attorney. Therefore, the court is to
encourage the child’s guardian to obtain counsel. Pursuant to Rule 1120, a guardian is any parent,
custodian, or other person who has legal custody of a child, or person designated by the court to be
a temporary guardian for purposes of a proceeding. See Pa.R.J.C.P. 1120.

Rule 1152. Waiver of Counsel.
A. Children.
1) Guardian ad litem. A child may not waive the right to a guardian ad
litem.
2) Legal Counsel. A child may waive legal counsel if:
a) the waiver is knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made; and
b) the court conducts a colloquy with the child on the record.
B. Other parties. Except as provided in paragraph (A), a party may waive the
right to counsel if:
1) the waiver is knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made; and
2) the court conducts a colloquy with the party on the record.
C. Stand-by counsel. The court may assign stand-by counsel if a party
waives counsel at any proceeding or stage of a proceeding.
D. Notice and revocation of waiver. If a party waives counsel for any proceeding, the waiver only applies to that proceeding, and the party may revoke the
waiver of counsel at any time. At any subsequent proceeding, the party shall be
informed of the right to counsel.
Comment
Under paragraph (A), a child may not waive the right to a guardian ad litem. The right of waiver
to legal counsel belongs to the child, not the guardian. See Rule 1800, which suspends 42 Pa.C.S.
§ 6337, which provides that counsel must be provided unless the guardian is present and waives
counsel for the child.
It is recommended that, at a minimum, the court ask questions to elicit the following information
in determining a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of counsel:
1) Whether the party understands the right to be represented by counsel;
2) Whether the party understands the nature of the dependency allegations and the elements of
each of those allegations;
3) Whether the party is aware of the dispositions and placements that may be imposed by the
court, including foster care placement and adoption;
4) Whether the party understands that if he or she waives the right to counsel, he or she will still
be bound by all the normal rules of procedure and that counsel would be familiar with these rules;
5) Whether the party understands that counsel may be better suited to defend the dependency
allegations; and
6) Whether the party understands that the party has many rights that, if not timely asserted, may
be lost permanently; and if errors occur and are not timely objected to, or otherwise timely raised by
the party, the ability to correct these errors may be lost permanently.

Rule 1154. Duties of Guardian Ad Litem.
A guardian ad litem shall:
1) Meet with the child as soon as possible following assignment pursuant
to Rule 1151 and on a regular basis thereafter in a manner appropriate to the
child’s age and maturity;
2) On a timely basis, be given access to relevant court and county agency
records, reports of examination of the guardians or the child, and medical, psychological, and school records;
3) Participate in all proceedings, including hearings before juvenile court
hearing officers, and administrative hearings and reviews to the degree necessary to adequately represent the child;
4) Conduct such further investigation necessary to ascertain the facts;
5) Interview potential witnesses, including the child’s guardians, caretakers, and foster parents, examine and cross-examine witnesses, and present witnesses and evidence necessary to protect the best interests of the child;
6) At the earliest possible date, be advised by the county agency having
legal custody of the child of:
a) any plan to relocate the child or modify custody or visitation
arrangements, including the reasons, prior to the relocation or change in custody or visitation; and
b) any proceeding, investigation, or hearing under the Child Protective
Services Law, 23 Pa.C.S. § 6301 et seq. or the Juvenile Act, 42 Pa.C.S.
§ 6301 et seq., directly affecting the child;
7) Make any specific recommendations to the court relating to the appropriateness and safety of the child’s placement and services necessary to address
the child’s needs and safety, including the child’s educational, health care, and
disability needs;
8) Explain the proceedings to the child to the extent appropriate given the
child’s age, mental condition, and emotional condition; and
9) Advise the court of the child’s wishes to the extent that they can be
ascertained and present to the court whatever evidence exists to support the
child’s wishes. When appropriate because of the age or mental and emotional
condition of the child, determine to the fullest extent possible the wishes of the
child and communicate this information to the court.
Comment:
If there is a conflict of interest between the duties of the guardian ad litem pursuant to paragraphs
(7) and (9), the guardian ad litem for the child may move the court for appointment as legal counsel
and assignment of a separate guardian ad litem when, for example, the information that the guardian
ad litem possesses gives rise to the conflict and can be used to the detriment of the child. If there is
not a conflict of interest, the guardian ad litem represents the legal interests and best interests of the

‘‘Legal interests’’ denotes that an attorney is to express the child’s wishes to the court regardless
of whether the attorney agrees with the child’s recommendation. ‘‘Best interests’’ denotes that a
guardian ad litem is to express what the guardian ad litem believes is best for the child’s care, protection, safety, and wholesome physical and mental development regardless of whether the child
agrees.
Pursuant to subdivision (7), the guardian ad litem is to make specific recommendations to the court
regarding the appropriateness of the child’s placement, giving consideration to the proximity and
appropriateness of the child’s school. See 42 Pa.C.S. § 6311(b)(7) and 42 U.S.C. § 675(1)(G). Inquiries into the child’s education should include the right to: 1) educational stability, including the right
to remain in the same school regardless of a change in placement when in the child’s best interest and
the right to immediate enrollment when a school change is in the child’s best interest, 42 U.S.C.

Rule 1166. Maintaining Records in the Clerk of Courts.
A. Generally. The juvenile court file is the official court record and shall
contain all original records, papers, and orders filed, copies of all court notices,
and docket entries. These records shall be maintained by the clerk of courts and
shall not be taken from the custody of the clerk of courts without order of the
court.
B. Docket entries. The clerk of courts shall maintain a list of docket entries:
a chronological list, in electronic or written form, of documents and entries in the
official court record and of all proceedings in the case. The clerk of courts shall
make docket entries at the time the information is made known to the clerk.
C. Contents of docket entries. The docket entries shall include, at a minimum, the following information:
GENERAL PROVISIONS 237 Rule 1165
11-35
(414095) No. 584 Jul. 23
1) the child’s name, address, date of birth, if known;
2) the guardian’s name, address, if known;
3) the names and addresses of all attorneys who have appeared or entered
an appearance, the date of the entry of appearance(s), and the date of any withdrawal of appearance(s);
4) notations concerning all papers filed with the clerk, including all court
notices, appearances, motions, orders, findings and adjudications, dispositions,
permanency reviews and adoptions, briefly showing the nature and title, if any,
of each paper filed, writ issued, and motion made, and the substance of each
order or disposition of the court and of the returns showing execution of process;
5) notations concerning motions made orally or orders issued orally in the
courtroom when directed by the court;
6) a notation of every judicial proceeding, continuance, and disposition;
7) the location of exhibits made part of the record during the proceedings;
and
8)a) the date of receipt in the clerk’s office of the order or court notice;
b) the date appearing on the order or court notice; and
c) the date and manner of service of the order or court notice; and
9) all other information required by Rule 1345.
D. Electronic Format. If a judicial district has provided for electronic filing
pursuant to Rule 1205, the juvenile court file in which electronic filing has been
utilized may be maintained solely in an electronic format as long as copies of the
documents maintained in the juvenile court file may be produced in a physical
paper format.
Comment
This rule sets forth the mandatory contents of the list of docket entries and the official court record.
This is not intended to be an exhaustive list of what is required to be recorded in the docket entries.
The judicial districts may require additional information to be recorded in a case or in all cases.
The list of docket entries is a running record of all information related to any action in a dependency case in the court of common pleas of the clerk’s county, such as dates of filings, of orders, and
of court proceedings, including hearings conducted by juvenile court hearing officers. Nothing in this
rule is intended to preclude the use of automated or other electronic means for time-stamping or making docket entries.
This rule applies to all proceedings in the court of common pleas, including hearings conducted by
juvenile court hearing officers, at any stage of the dependency case.
This rule is not intended to include items contained in the county agency records or reports.
The practice in some counties of creating the list of docket entries only if an appeal is taken is
inconsistent with this rule.
The requirement of paragraph (C)(3) that all attorneys and their addresses be recorded makes certain there is a record of all attorneys who have appeared for any party in the case. The requirement
also ensures that attorneys are served as required by Rules 1167 and 1345. See also Rule 1345(C)
concerning certificates of service.
In those cases in which the attorney has authorized receiving service by facsimile transmission or
electronic means, the docket entry required by paragraph (C)(3) is to include the facsimile number or
electronic address.
Paragraph (C)(5) recognizes that occasionally resolution of oral motions presented in open court
should be reflected in the docket, such as motions and orders.

Rule 1167. Filings and Service of Court Orders and Notices.
A. Filings.
1) All orders and court notices shall be transmitted promptly to the clerk
of courts for filing. Upon receipt by the clerk of courts, the order or court
notice shall be time-stamped promptly with the date of receipt.
2) All orders and court notices shall be filed in the official court record.
B. Service.
1) A copy of any order or court notice shall be served promptly on each
party’s attorney, and the party, if unrepresented.
2) The clerk of courts shall serve the order or court notice, unless the
president judge has promulgated a local rule designating service to be by the
court or its designee.
3) Methods of Service. Service shall be:
a) by:
i) personal delivery to the party’s attorney, and if unrepresented, the
party;
ii) mailing a copy to the party’s attorney or leaving a copy for the
attorney at the attorney’s office;
iii) in those judicial districts that maintain in the courthouse assigned
boxes for counsel to receive service, leaving a copy for the attorney in the
attorney’s box;
iv) sending a copy to an unrepresented party by first class mail
addressed to the party’s place of business, residence, or detention;
v) sending a copy by facsimile transmission or other electronic means
if the party’s attorney, and if unrepresented, the party has filed written
request for this method of service or has included a facsimile number or
an electronic address on a prior legal paper filed in the case;
GENERAL PROVISIONS 237 Rule 1167
11-37
(401367) No. 547 Jun. 20
vi) delivery to the party’s attorney, and if unrepresented, the party by
carrier service; or
b) orally in open court on the record; or
c) in a judicial district that permits electronic filing pursuant to Rule
1205, service of court orders or notices shall be made as provided in Rule
1205(D)(2) and (H)(1).
C. Unified Practice. Any local rule that is inconsistent with the provisions of
this rule is prohibited, including any local rule requiring a person to file or serve
orders or court notices.
Comment
Court notices, as used in this rule, are communications that ordinarily are issued by a judge or the
court administrator concerning, for example, calendaring or scheduling, including proceedings requiring the party’s presence.
A facsimile number or electronic address set forth on the letterhead is not sufficient to authorize
service by facsimile transmission or other electronic means under paragraph (B)(3)(a)(v). The authorization for service by facsimile transmission or other electronic means under this rule is valid only
for the duration of the case. A separate authorization is to be filed in each case by the party, if unrepresented, or by the attorney who wants to receive documents by this method of service.
Nothing in this rule is intended to preclude the use of automated or other electronic means for the
transmission of the orders or court notices between the judge, court administrator, and clerk of courts,
or for time-stamping.

PART D. JUVENILE COURT HEARING OFFICERS
Rule 1182. Qualifications of Juvenile Court Hearing Officer.
A. Education, Experience, and Training. To preside as a juvenile court hearing officer over cases governed by the Juvenile Act, 42 Pa.C.S. § 6301 et seq.,
an individual shall:
1) be a member, in good standing, of the bar of this Commonwealth;
2) have been licensed to practice law for at least five consecutive years;
and
3) have completed six hours of instruction, approved by the Pennsylvania
Continuing Legal Education Board prior to hearing cases, which specifically
addresses all of the following topics:
a) the Juvenile Act;
237 Rule 1182 JUVENILE RULES
11-38
(401368) No. 547 Jun. 20 Copyright  2020 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
b) the Pennsylvania Rules of Juvenile Court Procedure;
c) the Child Protective Services Law;
d) evidence rules and methodology; and
e) child and adolescent development.
B. Continuing Education. Upon meeting the requirements of paragraph
(A)(3), a juvenile court hearing officer shall thereafter complete six hours of
instruction from a course(s) designed by the Office of Children and Families in
the Courts, in juvenile dependency law, policy, or related social science research
every two years.
C. Compliance.
1) A juvenile court hearing officer shall sign an affidavit attesting that he
or she has met the requirements of this rule.
2) Prior to presiding as a juvenile court hearing officer, the attorney shall
send the affidavit to the President Judge or his or her designee of each judicial
district where the attorney is seeking to preside as a juvenile court hearing officer.
3) After submission of the initial affidavit pursuant to paragraph (C)(2),
juvenile court hearing officers shall submit a new affidavit every two years
attesting that the continuing education requirements of paragraph (B) have been
met.
Comment
Pursuant to paragraphs (A)(1) & (2), juvenile court hearing officers are to be in good standing and
have at least five consecutive years of experience as an attorney. It is best practice to have at least
two years of experience in juvenile law.
Pursuant to paragraph (A)(3), the initial training program(s) is to be approved by the Pennsylvania
Continuing Legal Education Board (Board). The program may be one course or multiple courses with
at least six hours of instruction, equivalent to at least six CLE credits. When the Board is approving
courses designed to address the requirements of this rule, it should consult with the Office of Children and Families in the Courts to ensure proper course requirements are being met. Additionally, for
this initial training course(s), training already provided by the Office of Children and Families in the
Courts or the Juvenile Court Judges’ Commission may meet the requirements of this Rule.
For continuing education under paragraph (B), juvenile court hearing officers are to attend six
hours of instruction from a course or multiple courses designed by the Office of Children and Families in the Courts. This is to ensure uniform training among juvenile court hearing officers.
These requirements are additional requirements to the Pa.R.C.L.E. because they mandate specific
training in juvenile dependency law. However, the credit hours received do count towards the total
maximum required under Pa.R.C.L.E. 105.
Pursuant to paragraph (C), a juvenile court hearing officer is to certify to the court that the requirements of this rule have been met prior to presiding as a juvenile court hearing officer, and submit new
affidavits every two years thereafter.

judge or his or her designee may appoint juvenile court hearing officers to hear
designated dependency matters.
B. Prohibited practice. Juvenile court hearing officers shall not engage in
practice before the juvenile court in the same judicial district where they preside
over dependency matters.
Comment
Under paragraph (A), the president judge of each judicial district may restrict the classes of cases
to be heard by the juvenile court hearing officer, in addition to the restrictions of Rule 1187. See 42

Rule 1187. Authority of Juvenile Court Hearing Officer.
A. No authority. A juvenile court hearing officer shall not have the authority
to:
1) preside over:
a) termination of parental rights hearings;
b) adoptions;
c) any hearing in which any party seeks to establish a permanency goal
of adoption or change the permanency goal to adoption;
2) enter orders for emergency or protective custody pursuant to Rules
1200 and 1210;
3) issue warrants; and
4) issue contempt orders.
B. Right to hearing before judge.
1) Prior to the commencement of any proceeding, the juvenile court hearing officer shall inform all parties of the right to have the matter heard by a
judge. If a party objects to having the matter heard by the juvenile court hearing officer, the case shall proceed before the judge.
237 Rule 1185 JUVENILE RULES
11-40
(414098) No. 584 Jul. 23 Copyright  2023 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
2) If a party objects to having the matter heard by the juvenile court hearing officer pursuant to paragraph (B)(1), the juvenile court hearing officer or
the court’s designee for scheduling cases shall immediately schedule a hearing
before the judge. The time requirements of these rules shall apply.
Comment
A juvenile court hearing officer’s authority is limited under this rule. To implement this rule, Rule
1800 suspends 42 Pa.C.S. § 6305(b) only to the extent that juvenile court hearing officers may not
hear all classes of cases.
Under paragraph (A)(1)(c), once the permanency goal has been approved for adoption by a judge,
all subsequent reviews or hearings may be heard by the juvenile court hearing officer unless a party
objects pursuant to paragraph (B).
Under paragraph (A)(3), nothing is intended to limit the juvenile court hearing officer’s ability, in
a proper case before the juvenile court hearing officer, to recommend to the court that a warrant be
issued. This includes arrest, bench, and search warrants.
Concerning the provisions of paragraph (B), see 42 Pa.C.S. § 6305(b).
Under paragraph (B)(2), it should be determined whenever possible before the date of the hearing
whether there will be an objection to having the matter heard before a juvenile court hearing officer.
If it is anticipated that there will be an objection, the case is to be scheduled in front of the judge,
rather than the juvenile court hearing officer to prevent continuances and delays in the case.
See Rule 1127 for recording of proceedings before a juvenile court hearing officer.

A. Types of cases. Juvenile court hearing officers may accept stipulations in
any classes of cases that they are permitted to hear pursuant to Rule 1187.
B. Requirements. The stipulation requirements of Rule 1405 shall be followed.
Comment
Under paragraph (A), a juvenile court hearing officer may accept stipulations in those permissible
classes of cases pursuant to Rule 1187. In addition, the president judge of each judicial district may
further restrict the classes of cases. See Rule 1185.
The court is to receive corroborating evidence, in addition to the stipulated facts, to make an independent determination that a child is dependent. See Rule 1405 and its Comment.

Rule 1191. Juvenile Court Hearing Officer’s Findings and Recommendation to the Judge.
A. Announcement of Findings and Recommendation. At the conclusion of the
hearing, the juvenile court hearing officer shall announce in open court on the
record, the juvenile court hearing officer’s findings and recommendation to the
judge.
B. Submission of Papers and Contents of Recommendation. Within two business days of the hearing, the juvenile court hearing officer shall submit specific
findings and a recommendation to the juvenile court judge. If requested, a copy
of the findings and recommendation shall be given to any party.
C. Challenge to Recommendation. A party may challenge the juvenile court
hearing officer’s recommendation by filing a motion with the clerk of courts
within three days of receipt of the recommendation. The motion shall request a
rehearing by the judge and aver reasons for the challenge.
D. Judicial Action. Within seven days of receipt of the juvenile court hearing
officer’s findings and recommendation, the judge shall review the findings and
recommendation of the juvenile court hearing officer and:
1) accept the recommendation by order;
2) reject the recommendation and issue an order with a different disposition;
3) send the recommendation back to the juvenile court hearing officer for
more specific findings; or
4) conduct a rehearing.
Comment
The juvenile court may promulgate a form for juvenile court hearing officers to use. The findings
and recommendation may take the form of a court order to be adopted by the court.
If a party contests the juvenile court hearing officer’s decision, the copy of the findings and recommendation may be used as an attachment in a motion for a rehearing in front of the judge.
The juvenile court hearing officer’s decision is subject to approval of the judge. When the judge,
in rejecting the juvenile court hearing officer’s recommendation, modifies a factual determination, a
rehearing is to be conducted. The judge may reject the juvenile court hearing officer’s findings and
enter a new finding or disposition without a rehearing if there is no modification of factual determinations. See In re Perry, 459 A.2d 789 (Pa. Super. 1983).
Nothing in this rule prohibits the court from modifying conclusions of law made by the juvenile
court hearing officer.

Comment
See 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 6321, 6324, 23 Pa.C.S. §§ 6315, 6369, 62 P.S. § 761.
If a county agency has custody of a child under a voluntary placement agreement and custody will
exceed thirty days, dependency proceedings are to be commenced by the filing of a petition by the
thirtieth day. A dependency petition is to be filed if a guardian requests return of the child and the
county agency refuses to return the child. A dependency petition is to be filed at the time of refusal
of return by the county agency. See 55 Pa. Code § 3130.65 for provisions on voluntary agreements.
For procedures on protective medical custody, see Rule 1201. For procedures on protective custody by police and the county agency, see Rule 1202.
For proceedings that have already been commenced in another judicial district, see Rule 1302 for

For resumption of jurisdiction, see Rules 1634 and 1635 & 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 6302 and 6351(j).
The clerk of courts and the county agency should have form motions available for children who
want to file for resumption of juvenile court jurisdiction. These forms are available at http://
www.pacourts.us/Forms/dependency.htm.
The clerk of courts or county agency is to assist any child who requests assistance in completing
the form and the clerk of courts is to accept all filings for resumption of juvenile court jurisdiction
regardless of whether the motions meet the standard for legal filings or there are objections by other
parties. This is to ensure these children have easy access to the court. See also Rule 1126.

judicial district shall ensure that a judge is available twenty-four hours a day,
every day of the year to accept and decide actions brought by the county
agency within the twenty-four hour period.

Comment
Notice to the county agency under paragraph (A) is to insure that appropriate proceedings are
commenced. Notice may be oral but is to be reduced to writing within twenty-four hours.
A child taken into protective custody is to be placed during the protective custody in an appropriate medical facility, foster home, or other appropriate facility approved by the Department of Public
Welfare for this purpose.
A conference between the guardian of the child taken into protective custody and the employee
designated by the county agency to be responsible for the child should be held within forty-eight
hours of the time that the child is taken into custody for the purpose of: 1) explaining to the guardian
the reasons for the temporary detention of the child and the whereabouts of the child, unless disclosure is prohibited by court order; 2) expediting, whenever possible, the return of the child to the custody of the guardian when protective custody is no longer necessary; and 3) explaining to the guardian the rights provided for by 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 6337, 6338.

Rule 1202. Procedures for Protective Custody by a Police Officer, Juvenile Probation Officer, and County Agency.
A. Protective custody.
1) No court order.
a) A police officer or a juvenile probation officer may take a child into
protective custody pursuant to Rule 1200 if there are reasonable grounds to
believe that the child is suffering from illness or injury or is in imminent
danger from the surroundings and removal is necessary.
b) Without unnecessary delay, but no more than twenty-four hours
after a child is taken into custody, an application for a protective custody
order shall be made to provide temporary emergency supervision of a child
pending a hearing pursuant to Rule 1242. The president judge of each judicial district shall ensure that a judge is available twenty-four hours a day,
every day of the year to accept and decide actions brought by the county
agency within the twenty-four hour period.
2) Court order.
a) A police officer, juvenile probation officers or county agency may
obtain a protective custody order removing a child from the home pursuant
to Rule 1210 if the court finds that remaining in the home is contrary to the
welfare and the best interests of the child.
b) Pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S. § 6315 and after a court order, the county
agency shall take the child into protective custody for protection from abuse.
No county agency may take custody of the child without judicial authorization based on the merits of the situation.

B. Notice.
1) In all cases, the person taking the child into custody immediately shall
notify the guardian and the county agency of:
a) the whereabouts of the child, unless disclosure is prohibited by court
order; and
b) the reasons for taking the child into custody.
2) Notice may be oral. The notice shall be reduced to writing within
twenty-four hours.
C. Placement. A child shall be placed in an appropriate shelter care facility
or receive other appropriate care pending a shelter care hearing pursuant to Rule
1242.
Comment
A properly commissioned juvenile probation officer has the authority to take a child into protective
custody as a duly authorized officer of the court pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 6324 unless the President
Judge has limited such authority pursuant to Rule 195. See also 23 Pa.C.S. § 6315.
Under paragraph (A)(1)(a) & (A)(2)(a), the police officer’s or juvenile probation officer’s duty is
to protect the child and remove the child safely. A police officer or juvenile probation officer may
bring the child to the county agency for supervision of the child pending a court order that should be
given immediately. The police officer’s or juvenile probation officer’s duty is to take a child into protective custody if there are reasonable grounds to believe that the child is suffering from illness or
injury or is in imminent danger from his or her surroundings, and that protective custody is necessary,
whereas the county agency’s duty is to supervise the child and find an appropriate placement for the
child when necessary. Only a police officer or juvenile probation officer may take custody of the child
without a court order. See Rule 1800 for suspension of 42 Pa.C.S. § 6324, which provides that law
enforcement officers may take a child into custody.
Paragraph (B) is to ensure that if the guardian is not present when the child is removed, the guardian knows the whereabouts of the child and the reasons the child is taken into custody. If the person
removing the child is not a caseworker, the county agency is to be notified to commence proceedings
in juvenile court.
Under paragraph (C), a child taken into protective custody is to be placed during the protective
custody in an appropriate shelter care facility or receive other appropriate care.
A conference between the guardian of the child taken into protective custody and the employee
designated by the county agency to be responsible for the child should be held within forty-eight
hours of the time that the child is taken into custody for the purpose of: 1) explaining to the guardian
the reasons for the temporary detention of the child and the whereabouts of the child, unless disclosure is prohibited by court order; 2) expediting, whenever possible, the return of the child to the custody of the guardian when protective custody is no longer necessary; and 3) explaining to the guardian the rights provided for by 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 6337, 6338.

Rule 1203. Indian Child.
(a) Inquiry.
(1) At the commencement of the initial proceeding, including a court’s
acceptance of either jurisdiction of a resident child from another state or supervision pursuant to another state’s order, the court shall inquire as to the efforts
made by the county agency to determine whether the child is an Indian child
and whether any participant has reason to know the child is an Indian child. All
responses shall be placed on the record.
(2) The court shall advise the participants of their obligation to report to
the court if they subsequently receive information that provides a reason to
know the child is an Indian child.
(b) Finding of Court. The court shall make a finding as to whether there is
reason to know the child is an Indian child.
(c) Additional Requirements.
(1) If the court finds there is reason to know the child is an Indian child,
but lacks sufficient evidence to determine whether the child is an Indian child,
the court shall confirm due diligence has been used to make such determination, and the court shall treat the child as an Indian child until it can determine,
from the record, that the child does not meet the definition of an Indian child.
(2) If the court has sufficient evidence to conclude the child is an Indian
child, then the notification and rights under the Indian Child Welfare Act shall
apply.
Comment:
The Indian Child Welfare Act, 25 U.S.C. §§ 1901 et seq. and the Bureau of Indian Affairs regulations, 25 C.F.R. § 23.107, require the court at the commencement of the initial proceeding to determine if any participant has reason to know whether the child is an Indian child.
For the definition of ‘‘Indian child,’’ see Rule 1120. Nothing in this rule is intended to prohibit the
court from continuing to inquire at every subsequent proceeding. For determination of a reason to
know whether a child is an Indian child, see 25 C.F.R. § 23.107. When a court knows or has reason
to know that a child is an Indian child, see 25 C.F.R. § 23.111 for notice requirements. See also
25 C.F.R. § 23.11.
For additional requirements concerning the emergency removal or emergency placement of an
Indian child, see 25 C.F.R. § 23.113. For additional requirements concerning the non-emergent placement of an Indian child, see 25 C.F.R. §§ 23.121-122. For the transfer of proceedings to the Indian
child’s tribe, see 25 C.F.R. §§ 23.115—.119. For requirements concerning voluntary proceedings for
the placement of an Indian child, see 25 C.F.R. §§ 23.124—.127. For the placement preferences of
an Indian child, see 25 C.F.R. §§ 23.131-132.

unable to access the system, at a minimum, shall be able to file legal papers
in a physical paper format and be served legal papers in a physical format
which were electronically filed;
c) any additional provisions as the court may deem necessary to provide a full and complete procedure for the use of the system within the judicial district; and
d) a notation that the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts and
the judicial district have agreed upon an implementation plan for PACFile in
the judicial district.
2) Any judicial district that authorized electronic filing for a period of two
years thereafter may amend their local rule, subject to the requirements of Rule
1121 and Rule of Judicial Administration 103, to make participation in electronic filing mandatory.

courts;
‘‘filing party,’’ an attorney or other person or entity who files a legal paper
by means of electronic filing;

authorization process established by the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts.
2) Establishment of an account by an attorney or authorization of a nonattorney in the system, to the extent so authorized by the Administrative Office

3) An attorney or non-attorney participating in the system is permitted to
file a legal paper either in an electronic format or in a physical paper format.

H. Service.
1) Upon the submission of a legal paper for electronic filing, the system
shall provide an electronic notification to other parties and attorneys to the case
who are participating in electronic filing that the legal paper has been submitted. This notification upon submission shall satisfy the service requirements of
Rules 1167(B) and 1345(B) on any attorney or party who has established a
system account.
2) Upon the acceptance by the clerk of courts office of a legal paper for
electronic filing, the system shall provide an electronic notification to other
parties and attorneys to the case who are participating in electronic filing that
the legal paper has been accepted.
3) Service of electronic filings on any attorney or party who has not
established a UJS web portal account or who is unable to file or receive legal
papers electronically or otherwise unable to access the system shall be made by
the procedures provided under Rules 1167(B) and 1345(B).
Comment
This rule permits as a local practice the electronic filing of legal papers. This rule does not require
the implementation of electronic filing by a local court. To provide a uniform system for electronic
filing, the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts has developed the PACFile electronic filing
system. This is the only authorized system for electronic filing of legal documents in dependency
proceedings.
Paragraph (B) requires that a judicial district that desires to participate in the electronic filing system must adopt a local rule to that effect. As part of the initial ‘‘opting into’’ electronic filing, this
local rule must provide that participation is voluntary. Once a judicial district has allowed electronic
filing for two years, participation may be made mandatory. Paragraph (B)(1)(b) requires that all judicial districts in which electronic filing is allowed must make accommodations for those parties who
are unable to participate. In no event shall access to the court filing be precluded solely on the basis
of participation in the electronic filing system.
The UJS Portal contains other automated services beside PACFile. There may be circumstances
when an attorney, who has registered as a user on another service of the UJS Portal, may have an
established account that would be usable for PACFile. Any questions about the requirements of registration or accessibility to PACFile should be referred to the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania
Courts.
The system permits a user to designate other users as proxies on individual cases. These proxies
all receive notice of any filing in the case. It is anticipated that offices such as those of a county
agency or advocate organization would be able to establish general user accounts with particular
attorneys assigned and their supervisors or back-ups listed as proxies in individual cases.
An attorney is responsible for the actions of other individuals whom the attorney authorizes to use
the attorney’s account.
The local rule required by this rule must conform to the requirements of Rule 1121 (Local Rules)
and Rule of Judicial Administration 103 (Procedures for Adoption, Filing, and Publishing Rules).
A file in physical paper format is not required by this rule. If the local rule requires a file in physical paper format, the requirement may extend to all cases or only to certain specified cases. For
example, the court may require files in physical paper format for cases where an adjudicatory hearing
has been scheduled while maintaining only electronic files for cases proceeding by informal adjustment or admission.
Upon submission of the electronic filing of a legal paper, the electronic filing system shall automatically send notice of the filing to all parties who have agreed to service by electronic transmisCOMMENCEMENT OF PROCEEDINGS 237 Rule 1205

(422187) No. 605 Apr. 25
sion, see paragraph (D) (Participation). If the electronic filing system sends notice of such filing, the
party filing the legal paper only need serve those parties who are not served by the electronic filing
system. An e-mail address set forth on letterhead is not a sufficient basis under this rule to permit
electronic service of legal papers.
Service pursuant to paragraph (H) is not intended to satisfy the notice requirements necessary to
obtain a bench warrant pursuant to Pa.R.J.C.P. 1140.
See Rule 1167(B) providing for the clerk of courts to serve orders and court notices by facsimile
transmission or other means.
See Rule 1345(B) governing service of motions and any written answers, and any notices or documents for which filing is required by facsimile transmission or other means.

reason to know the child is an Indian child pursuant to Rule 1203. All
responses shall be placed on the record.
(3) The order may initially be oral, provided that it is reduced to writing
within 24 hours or the next court business day.

Comment:
See 42 Pa.C.S. § 6324 for statutory provisions concerning taking into custody.
For a discussion of the due process requirements for taking a child into emergency custody, see
Patterson v. Armstrong County Children and Youth Services, 141 F. Supp. 2d 512 (W.D. Pa. 2001).
The court is to determine whether reasonable efforts, including services and family finding efforts,
were made to prevent placement or in the case of an emergency placement where services were not
offered and could not have prevented the necessity of placement, whether this level of effort was reasonable due to the emergency nature of the situation, safety considerations and circumstances of the
family. See 42 Pa.C.S. § 6332.
See also In re Petition to Compel Cooperation with Child Abuse Investigation, 875 A.2d 365 (Pa.
Super. 2005).
The court is required to inquire and determine whether any participants have reason to know
whether the child is an Indian child. The court is also required to advise the participants of their obligation to report to the court if they subsequently receive information that provides a reason to know
the child is an Indian child. See Pa.R.J.C.P. 1203.
Pursuant to subdivision (d)(8), the county agency should be looking for family and kin as a
resource to aid and assist the family to prevent removal of the child from the home. When removal
of the child is necessary, placement with family and kin will help reduce the potential trauma of the
removal from the home. See Rule 1149 regarding family finding requirements.

COMMENCEMENT OF PROCEEDINGS 237 Rule 1240
12-11
(422189) No. 605 Apr. 25
(2) the name, date of birth, and address of the child, if known;
(3) the name and address of the child’s guardian, or if unknown, the name
and address of the nearest adult relative;
(4) the date that the child was taken into custody;
(5) a concise statement of facts in support of the allegation of dependency;
(6) a statement detailing family finding efforts and:
(i) the reasonable efforts made to prevent placement; and
(ii) why there are no less restrictive alternatives available;
(7) a verification by the applicant that the facts set forth in the petition are
true and correct to the applicant’s personal knowledge, information, or belief,
and that any false statements are subject to the penalties of 18 Pa.C.S. § 4904,
relating to unsworn falsification to authorities;
(8) the signature of the applicant and the date of the execution of the
application;
(9) the whereabouts of the child unless the county agency has determined
it would pose a risk to the safety of the child or the guardian, or disclosure is
prohibited by the court; and
(10) whether the applicant has reason to know the child is an Indian child
as defined in Rule 1120.
Comment:
In lieu of a shelter care application, the county agency may file a petition as set forth in Rule 1330.
The primary focus of the shelter care application is to assert that protective custody is needed, and
the child should remain in the custody of the county agency. A shelter care hearing is to be held within
72 hours of taking the child into protective custody. See Pa.R.J.C.P. 1242(d).
Pursuant to subdivision (b)(6), the application is to contain a statement detailing the reasonable
efforts made to prevent placement and the specific reasons why there are no less restrictive alternatives available. This statement may include information such as: 1) the circumstances of the case; 2)
family finding efforts made by the county agency; 3) contact with family members or other kin; 4)
the child’s educational, health care, and disability needs; and 5) any need for emergency actions.
See Rule 1149 regarding family finding requirements.

2) the guardian(s) of the child;

B. Counsel. The guardian of the child shall be notified of the right to counsel immediately after a child is taken into protective custody and before a shelter
care hearing.
Comment
Notice should be as timely as possible. Because there is a seventy-two hour time restriction, notice
may be oral. Every possible attempt to notify all parties is to be made. It is not sufficient to notify
only one guardian. All guardians are to be notified. See In re M.L., 562 Pa. 646, 757 A.2d 849 (2000).
The hearing may go forward if a guardian is not present. However, if a guardian has not been notified, a rehearing is to be ordered under Rule 1243 upon submission of an affidavit by the guardian.
The court is to direct the county agency to provide the child’s foster parent, preadoptive parent or
relative providing care for the child with timely notice of the hearing. See 42 Pa.C.S. § 6336.1.
If a court appointed special advocate is involved in the case, the court appointed special advocate
is to be notified as any other appropriate person pursuant to paragraph (A)(7).

COMMENCEMENT OF PROCEEDINGS 237 Rule 1242
12-13
(422191) No. 605 Apr. 25
(iii) the child’s placement is the least restrictive placement that meets the
needs of the child, supported by reasons why there are no less restrictive
alternatives available; and
(iv) the lack of efforts was reasonable in the case of an emergency
placement where services were not offered;
(4) a person, other than the county agency, submitting a shelter care application, is a party to the proceedings;
(5) there are any special needs of the child that have been identified and
that the court deems necessary to address while the child is in shelter care; and
(6) the county agency has made efforts to determine whether the child is
an Indian child and whether any participant has reason to know the child is an
Indian child pursuant to Rule 1203.
(d) Prompt Hearing. The court shall conduct a hearing within 72 hours of
taking the child into protective custody. The parties shall not be permitted to
waive the shelter care hearing.

enter a written order setting forth:
(1) its findings pursuant to subdivision (c);
(2) any conditions placed upon any party;
(3) any orders regarding family finding pursuant to Rule 1149;
(4) any orders for placement or temporary care of the child;

(7) any orders of visitation; and
(8) whether there is reason to know the child is an Indian child pursuant to
Rule 1203.
Comment:
Pursuant to subdivision (b)(4), it is expected that the parties be present. Only upon good cause
shown should advanced communication technology be utilized.
Pursuant to subdivision (c), the court is to make a determination that the evidence presented with
the shelter care application under Rule 1240 is supported by sufficient facts. After this determination,
the court is to determine whether the custody of the child is warranted by requiring a finding that: 1)
remaining in the home would be contrary to the health and welfare of the child; 2) reasonable efforts
were made by the county agency to prevent the placement of the child; 3) the child was placed in the
least restrictive placement available; and 4) if the child was taken into emergency placement without
services being offered, the lack of efforts by the county agency was reasonable. Additionally, the court
is to state the reasons why there are no less restrictive alternatives available.
Family finding is to be initiated prior to the shelter care hearing. See Comment to Rule 1149 as to
level of reasonableness.
Pursuant to subdivision (c)(2), the court is to make a determination whether the county agency has
reasonably engaged or is to engage in family finding in the case. The county agency will be required
to report its diligent family finding efforts at subsequent hearings. See Rule 1149 for requirements of
family finding. See also Rules 1408(b), 1512(D)(1)(h), 1514(a)(4), 1608(d)(1)(viii), and 1610(D) and
their Comments for the court’s findings as to the county agency’s satisfaction of the family finding
237 Rule 1242 JUVENILE RULES
12-14
(422192) No. 605 Apr. 25 Copyright  2025 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
requirements and Rules 1210(d), 1409(c) and 1609(D) and Comments to Rules 1408, 1409, 1512,
1514, 1515, and 1608—1611 on the court’s orders.
Pursuant to subdivision (c)(4), the court is to determine whether a person is a proper party to the
proceedings. Regardless of the court’s findings on the party status, the court is to determine if the
application is supported by sufficient evidence.
The court is required to inquire and determine whether any participants have reason to know
whether the child is an Indian child. The court is also required to advise the participants of their obligation to report to the court if they subsequently receive information that provides a reason to know
the child is an Indian child. See Pa.R.J.C.P. 1203.
Under subdivision (d), the court is to ensure a timely hearing. Nothing in subdivision (d) is
intended to preclude the use of stipulations or agreements among the parties, subject to court review
and acceptance at the shelter care hearing.
See 42 Pa.C.S. § 6332 (Informal Hearing).
Pursuant to subdivision (e), the court is to enter a written order. It is important that the court
address any special needs of the child while the child is in shelter care. The child’s attorney or the
county agency is to present any educational, health care, and disability needs to the court, if known
at the time of the hearing. These needs may include a child’s educational stability, needs concerning
early intervention, remedial services, health care, and disability. If the court determines a child is in
need of an educational decision maker, the court is to appoint an educational decision maker pursuant
to Rule 1147.
The court’s order should address the child’s educational stability, including the right to an educational decision maker. The order should address the child’s right to: 1) educational stability, including
the right to: a) remain in the same school regardless of a change in placement when it is in the child’s
best interest; b) immediate enrollment when a school change is in the child’s best interest; and c) have
school proximity considered in all placement changes, 42 U.S.C. §§ 675(1)(G) and 11431
et seq.; 2) an educational decision maker pursuant to Rule 1147, 42 Pa.C.S. § 6301, 20 U.S.C.
§ 1439(a)(5), and 34 C.F.R. § 300.519; 3) an appropriate education, including any necessary special
education, early intervention, or remedial services pursuant to 24 P.S. §§ 13-1371 and 13-1372, 55
Pa. Code § 3130.87, and 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400 et seq.; 4) the educational services necessary to support
the child’s transition to successful adulthood pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 6351 if the child is 14 or older;
and 5) a transition plan that addresses the child’s educational needs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 675(5)(H)
if the child will age out of care within 90 days.
When addressing the child’s health and disability needs, the court’s order should address the right
of: 1) a child to receive timely and medically appropriate screenings and health care services, 55
Pa. Code § 3800.32 and 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(r); and 2) a child with disabilities to receive necessary
accommodations, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.101 et seq., Section 504 of the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. § 794, and implementing regulations at 45 C.F.R. §§ 84.1 et
seq.
Pursuant to the Juvenile Act, the court has authority to order a physical or mental examination of
a child and medical or surgical treatment of a minor, who is suffering from a serious physical condition or illness which requires prompt treatment in the opinion of a physician. The court may order the
treatment even if the guardians have not been given notice of the pending hearing, are not available,
or without good cause inform the court that they do not consent to the treatment. See 42 Pa.C.S.
§ 6339(b).
Nothing in this rule prohibits informal conferences, narrowing of issues, if necessary, and the court
making appropriate orders to expedite the case. The shelter care hearing may be used as a vehicle to
discuss the matters needed and narrow the issues. The court is to ensure a timely adjudicatory hearing
is held.
See 42 Pa.C.S. § 6339 for orders of physical and mental examinations and treatment.
See Rule 1330(a) for filing of a petition.

a party or on its own motion.
C. Forum. The judge, who heard the original shelter care hearing or adopted
the findings of the juvenile court hearing officer, shall hold the rehearing, unless

Comment
See 42 Pa.C.S. § 6332(b).
Under paragraph (A), upon receiving an affidavit, the county agency is to schedule a rehearing,
forward the affidavit to the proper person to schedule a rehearing, or submit the affidavit to the court
for rescheduling.
Under paragraph (C), only a judge may hold a rehearing, unless the judge orders a juvenile court
hearing officer to hear the case.

PART A. VENUE
Rule 1300. Venue.
A. Generally. A dependency proceeding shall be commenced in:
1) the county in which the child is present; or
2) the child’s county of residence.
B. Change of Venue. At any time prior to the adjudicatory hearing, for the
convenience of parties and witnesses, the court, upon its own motion or motion
of any party, may transfer an action to the appropriate court of any county where
the action could originally have been brought or could be brought at the time of
filing the motion to change venue.
C. Transmission of All Records. If there is a change of venue ordered pursuant to paragraph (B), within five days:
1) the transferring county’s clerk of courts shall inform the receiving
county’s clerk of courts of the manner in which certified copies of all documents, reports, and summaries in the child’s official court record will be transferred;
2) the transferring county’s clerk of courts shall transfer certified copies of
all documents, reports, and summaries in the child’s official court record to the
receiving county’s clerk of courts;
3) the transferring county agency shall transfer all its records to the
receiving county agency;
4) the receiving county’s clerk of courts shall notify its county agency and
the transferring county’s clerk of courts of its receipt of the official court
records; and
5) the receiving county agency shall schedule the next court proceeding in
accordance with the time requirements of these Rules.
D. Continuation of Services. To ensure there is no interruption in services,
the transferring county agency is to continue services until the case transfer has
been completed, which occurs when the receiving county’s clerk of court notifies
of receipt of the official court record as provided in paragraph (C)(4).
Comment
See 42 Pa.C.S. § 6321(b).
For procedures regarding motions and answers, see Rule 1344. In addition to the procedures for
service of orders under Rule 1167, an order changing venue is to be served upon the new county
agency and the receiving court so they may begin proceedings in the receiving county.
Pursuant to paragraph (C), all records are to be transferred within five days of the order for change
in venue. Nothing in this rule prohibits the use of electronic means when transferring and receiving
records, but the manner in which records are transmitted must be communicated. If there is an electronic transfer, the receiving county is to send an electronic confirmation of receipt of the records as
the return receipt. The transferring county’s clerk of courts is to docket the confirmation of receipt of
records by the receiving county and may close the case once the confirmation has been received.
For transfer of agency records, see 55 Pa. Code § 3490.401.

Rule 1302. Intercounty Transfer.
A. Best Interest of the Child. Any time after the adjudicatory hearing, upon

that a proposed transfer would be in the child’s best interest and would result in
a transfer between judicial districts:
1) the court shall communicate with the president judge or designee of the
receiving judicial district to ascertain whether jurisdiction will be accepted;
2) a record of the communication shall be made and served promptly by
the court on the parties; and

parties, the receiving county agency, and the president judge or designee of the
receiving court, if applicable.

3) The receiving county’s clerk of courts shall notify its county agency
and the transferring court of its receipt of the official court records.
I. County Agencies. The transferring county agency shall continue services
until the effective date of the transfer.
Comment
If proceedings are commenced in a county other than the county of the child’s residence, then a
change of venue should be sought pursuant to Rule 1300 prior to adjudication.
The child’s best interest concerning an intercounty transfer includes, but is not limited to, the
child’s current or anticipated county of residence, the resources of the receiving county, and needs of
the child and family. A proposed transfer between judicial districts is not in the child’s best interest
unless the court of the receiving judicial district accepts jurisdiction.
Service of the acceptance order on the transferring court pursuant to paragraph (G)(3) is unnecessary if the transfer occurs within the same judicial district.
The period between the order approving the transfer and the effective date of the transfer is
intended to prepare for the case transfer. The county agencies are expected to communicate prior to
the actual transfer of a case to another county so that efforts can be coordinated and services transitioned without interruption. Coordination includes the inter-agency transfer of records maintained by
the county agency that are not otherwise included in the official court record. See 55 Pa. Code
§ 3490.401. This period also allows the clerk to prepare the official court record for transmission to
the receiving county on the effective date of the transfer.
Nothing in this rule prohibits the use of electronic means when transferring and receiving records.
However, if there is an electronic transfer, the receiving county is to send an electronic confirmation
237 Rule 1302 JUVENILE RULES
13-4
(402214) No. 551 Oct. 20 Copyright  2020 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
of receipt of the records as the return receipt. The transferring county’s clerk of courts is to docket the
confirmation of receipt of records by the receiving county and may close the case once the confirmation has been received.
Upon receiving the order accepting the case, the transferring court may order the termination of
court supervision pursuant to Rule 1631(A)(12).

Rule 1321. Hearing on Application for Private Petition.
(a) Hearing. The court shall conduct a hearing within 14 days of the presentation of the application for a petition to determine:
(1) if there are sufficient facts alleged to support a petition of dependency;
(2) the efforts made by the applicant to determine whether the child is an

(3) whether the person applying for the petition is a proper party to the
proceedings.
(b) Findings.
(1) The court shall make a finding as to whether there is reason to know
the child is an Indian child pursuant to Rule 1203.
(2) If the court finds sufficient facts to support a petition of dependency,

to support a petition of dependency; and 2) the applying person is a proper party to the proceedings.
A petition of dependency may go forward regardless of whether the applicant is determined to be a
party to the proceedings.
If a child is in custody, the hearing under subdivision (a) may be combined with the shelter care
hearing pursuant to Rule 1242.

The court is required to inquire and determine whether any participants have reason to know
whether the child is an Indian child. The court is also required to advise the participants of their obligation to report to the court if they subsequently receive information that provides a reason to know
the child is an Indian child. See Pa.R.J.C.P. 1203.

PART C. PETITION
Rule 1330. Petition: Filing, Contents, Function, Aggravated Circumstances.
(a) Filings.
(1) A dependency petition may be filed at any time; however, if a child is
taken into custody, the requirements of subdivision (a)(2) shall be met.
(2) Within 24 hours of the shelter care hearing, the county agency shall file
a dependency petition with the clerk of courts if:
(i) the child remains in protective custody pursuant to Rule 1201, 1202
or 1210; or
(ii) the child is not in protective custody but it is determined at a shelter
care hearing pursuant to Rule 1242 that the filing of a dependency petition is
appropriate.
(b) Petition Contents. Every petition shall set forth plainly:
(1) the name of the petitioner;
(2) the name, date of birth, and address of the child, if known;
(3) the name and address of the child’s guardian, or if unknown, the name
and address of the nearest adult relative;
(4) whether the petitioner has reason to know the child is an Indian child
as defined in Rule 1120;
(5) a statement:
(i) that it is in the best interest of the child and the public that the proceedings be brought; and
(ii) whether the child is currently under the supervision of the county
agency;
(6) a statement detailing family finding efforts and whether the county
agency is seeking placement:
(i) the reasonable efforts made to prevent placement; and
(ii) why there are no less restrictive alternatives available;
(7) a concise statement of facts in support of the allegations for which the
petition has been filed with
(i) facts for each allegation set forth separately; and

allegation;
(8) a verification by the petitioner that the facts set forth in the petition are

relating to unsworn falsification to authorities;
PRE-ADJUDICATORY PROCEDURES 237 Rule 1330
13-6.1
(422197) No. 605 Apr. 25
(9) the signature of the petitioner and the date of the execution of the petition; and
(10) the whereabouts of the child unless disclosure is prohibited by court
order and if taken into custody, the date and time thereof.
(c) Aggravated Circumstances. A motion for finding of aggravated circumstances may be brought in the petition pursuant to Rule 1701(A).
Comment:
Petitions should be filed without unreasonable delay.
Rule 1800 suspends 42 Pa.C.S. § 6331 only as to the time requirement of when a petition is to be
filed.
Subdivision (a)(2) requires that the county agency file a petition. Any other person, other than the
county agency, is to file an application to file a petition under Rule 1320. Rule 1800 suspends 42
Pa.C.S. § 6334, which provides any person may file a petition.
For the safety or welfare of a child or a guardian, the court may order that the addresses of the
child or a guardian not be disclosed to specified individuals.
Pursuant to subdivision (b)(6), when the county agency is seeking placement, the petition is to
include the reasonable efforts made to prevent placement, including efforts for family finding, and
why there are no less restrictive alternatives available. See Rule 1149 for family finding requirements.
See also Rule 1242(c)(2), (c)(3)(ii)-(c)(3)(iii), and Comments to Rules 1242, 1409, 1515, and 1608—
1611 for reasonable efforts determinations.
If a petition is filed after the county agency has discontinued family finding for non-court cases,
the county agency is to aver reasons for the discontinuance in the petition. See 67 Pa.C.S. § 7503.
A motion for finding of aggravated circumstances may be brought in a dependency petition. See
Pa.R.J.C.P. 1701(A). If aggravated circumstances are determined to exist after the filing of a petition,
a written motion is to be filed pursuant to Rules 1701 and 1344.
The aggravated circumstances, as defined by 42 Pa.C.S. § 6302, are to be specifically identified in
the motion for finding of aggravated circumstances.

B. Continuance. Upon amendment, the court may:
1) grant a continuance of the adjudicatory hearing; or

PART D. PROCEDURES FOLLOWING FILING OF PETITION
Rule 1340. Discovery and Inspection.
A. Informal. Before any party can seek any disclosure or discovery under
these rules, the parties or their counsel shall make a good faith effort to resolve
all questions of discovery, and to provide information required or requested under
these rules as to which there is no dispute. When there are items requested by one
party that the other party has refused to disclose, the demanding party may make
an appropriate motion to the court. Such motion shall be made as soon as possible prior to the hearing. In such motion, the party shall state that a good faith
effort to discuss the requested material has taken place and proved unsuccessful.
Nothing in this rule shall delay the disclosure of any items agreed upon by the
parties pending resolution of any motion for discovery.
B. Mandatory disclosure.
1) By the county agency. In all cases, on request by a party and subject to
any protective order which the county agency might obtain under this rule, the
county agency shall disclose to a party, all of the following requested items or
information, provided they are material to the instant case. The county agency
shall, when applicable, permit a party to inspect and copy or photograph such
items:
a) the name and last known address of each witness to the occurrence
that forms the basis of allegations of dependency unless disclosure is prohibited by law;
b) the name and last known address of each witness who did not witness the occurrence but is expected to testify;
c) copies of any written statements made by any party or witness
unless disclosure is prohibited by law;
237 Rule 1336 JUVENILE RULES
13-8
(326080) No. 390 May 07 Copyright  2007 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
d) any results or reports of scientific tests or expert opinions that are
within the possession or control of the county agency that the county agency
intends to use as evidence at a hearing;
e) any police reports, records of prior county agency involvement, or
records of current or prior reports involving the Child Protective Services
Law, 23 Pa.C.S. § 6301 et seq., that the county agency intends to use as evidence at a hearing;
f) if any physical or mental condition of a party is in controversy, any
physical or mental examinations, including oral or written reports that a party
intends to use as evidence at the hearing;
g) any tangible objects, including documents, photographs, or other
tangible evidence unless disclosure is prohibited by law;
h) the names, addresses, and curriculum vitae of any expert witness
that a party intends to call at a hearing and the subject matter about which
each expert witness is expected to testify, and a summary of the grounds for
each opinion to be offered; and
i) any other evidence that is material to adjudication, disposition, dispositional review, or permanency unless disclosure is prohibited by law, and
is within the possession or control of the county agency;
2) By all other parties. All other parties shall provide discovery to the
county agency and all other parties and shall disclose, all of the following
requested items or information that the party intends to use at a hearing, provided they are material to the instant case unless disclosure is prohibited by
law. The party shall, when applicable, permit the county agency to inspect and
copy or photograph such items:
a) the names and last known addresses of each witness who is
expected to testify;
b) copies of any written statements made by any party or witness;
c) any tangible objects, including documents, photographs, or other
tangible evidence;
d) the names, addresses, and curriculum vitae of any expert witness
that a party intends to call at a hearing and the subject matter about which
each expert witness is expected to testify, and a summary of the grounds for
each opinion to be offered; and
e) any other evidence that a party intends to introduce at a hearing.
C. Discretionary. Upon motion of any party for discovery, the court may
order any discovery upon a showing that the evidence is material to the preparation of the case and that the request is reasonable.
D. Continuing Duty to Disclose. If, prior to or during a hearing, either party
discovers additional evidence or material previously requested or ordered to be
disclosed by it, which is subject to discovery or inspection under this rule, or the
identity of an additional witness or witnesses, such party promptly shall notify the
opposing party or the court of the additional evidence, material, or witness.
PRE-ADJUDICATORY PROCEDURES 237 Rule 1340
13-9
(326081) No. 390 May 07
E. Remedy. If at any time during the course of the proceedings it is brought
to the attention of the court that a party has failed to comply with this rule, the
court may order such party to permit discovery or inspection, may grant a continuance, or may prohibit such party from introducing evidence or witnesses not
disclosed, or it may enter such other order as it deems just under the circumstances.
F. Protective orders. Upon a sufficient showing, the court may at any time
order that the discovery or inspection be denied, restricted, or deferred, or make
such other order as is appropriate to protect the best interests of the child. Upon
motion of any party, the court may permit the showing to be made, in whole or
in part, in the form of a written statement to be inspected by the court. If the court
enters an order granting relief, the entire text of the statement shall be sealed and
preserved in the records of the court to be made available to the appellate court(s)
in the event of an appeal.
G. Work Product. Disclosure shall not be required of legal research or of
records, correspondence, reports, or memoranda to the extent that they contain
the opinions, theories, or conclusions of the attorney for a party, or members of
their legal staffs.
Comment
Discovery under this rule applies to discovery for the adjudicatory hearing, dispositional hearing,
dispositional review hearings, or permanency hearings of dependency proceedings governed by the
Juvenile Act. See Rule 1100 for scope of rules. See Rule 1123 for production of documents pursuant
to a subpoena duces tecum. See also In re A.H., 763 A.2d 873 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2000).
The purpose of paragraph (A) is to encourage an informal discovery process. Only when the informal process fails and there is a genuine dispute as to discovery, should a motion to compel discovery
be made. Motions may be oral or written, see Rule 1344.
The items listed in paragraph (B) are to be disclosed to ensure a party has the ability to prepare
adequately for the hearing. See In re J.C., 412 Pa. Super. 369, 603 A.2d 627 (1992).
See Rule 1800 for suspension of 23 Pa.C.S. § 6339, which provides for the confidentiality of
reports made pursuant to the Child Protective Services Law, 23 Pa.C.S. § 6301 et seq., which is suspended only insofar as the Law is inconsistent with Rule 1340(B)(1)(e), which provides for the disclosure of such reports if the reports are going to be used as evidence in a hearing to prove dependency of a child. It is important to note that this section is only suspended if the reports are going to
be used as evidence during a hearing. If the reports are not going to be used, the confidentiality
requirements of 23 Pa.C.S. § 6339 still apply. In addition, confidential sources are protected and the
name of the source does not have to be disclosed. See 23 Pa.C.S. § 6340 (c) for protection of confidential sources reporting allegations of abuse under the Child Protective Services Law. 23 Pa.C.S.
§ 6301 et seq.
Under paragraph (C), the following are examples of evidence that may be material to the preparation of the case, but the list is not meant to be exhaustive: 1) domestic violence treatment records; 2)
drug and alcohol treatment records; 3) mental health records; 4) medical records; 5) any other evidence specifically identified, provided the requesting party can additionally establish that its disclosure would be in the interests of justice, including any information concerning any person involved
in the case who has received either valuable consideration, or an oral or written promise or contract
for valuable consideration, for information concerning the case, or for the production of any work
237 Rule 1340 JUVENILE RULES
13-10
(326082) No. 390 May 07 Copyright  2007 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
describing the case, or for the right to depict the character of the person in connection with his or her
involvement in the case. Items listed in this paragraph are subject to rules of confidentiality and this
rule is not intended to subrogate those rules.
Under paragraph (C), the court has discretion, upon motion, to order an expert who is expected to
testify at a hearing to prepare a report. However, these provisions are not intended to require a prepared report in every case. The court should determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether a report
should be prepared. For example, a prepared report ordinarily would not be necessary when the expert
is known to the parties and testifies about the same subject on a regular basis. On the other hand, a
report might be necessary if the expert is not known to the parties or is going to testify about a new
or controversial technique.
It is intended that the remedies provided in paragraph (E) apply equally to all parties, as the interests of justice require.
The provision for a protective order, paragraph (F), does not confer upon any party any right of
appeal not presently afforded by law.
In addition to information requested under this rule, an attorney has the right to inspect all court
records and files. See Rule 1160.

Rule 1342. Pre-Adjudicatory Conference.
A. Scope of conference. At any time after the filing of a petition, upon
motion, or upon its own motion, the court may order the parties to appear before
it for a conference.
B. Objections. The parties shall have the right to record an objection to rulings of the court during the conference.
C. Record. The court shall place on the record the agreements or objections
made by the parties and rulings made by the court as to any of the matters considered in the pre-adjudicatory conference. Such order shall control the subsequent proceedings unless modified at the adjudicatory hearing to prevent injustice.
Comment
This rule does not prevent other forms of pre-adjudicatory conferences. A judge may order a preadjudicatory conference between parties without the judge’s presence at the conference to discuss
preliminary matters.
Under paragraph (A), the court may consider: 1) the terms and procedures for pre-adjudicatory
discovery and inspection; 2) the simplification or stipulation of factual issues, including admissibility
of evidence; 3) the qualification of exhibits as evidence to avoid unnecessary delay; 4) the number of
witnesses who are to give testimony of a cumulative nature; 5) whether expert witnesses will be
called; 6) whether the hearing will be scheduled in front of the juvenile court hearing officer or judge;
and 7) such other matters as may aid in the disposition of the proceeding.

PART E. PRESERVATION OF TESTIMONY AND EVIDENCE
Rule 1380. Preservation of Testimony After Commencement of Proceedings.
A. By Court Order.
237 Rule 1364 JUVENILE RULES
13-16
(342584) No. 415 Jun. 09 Copyright  2009 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
1) At any time after the commencement of proceedings, upon motion of
any party, and after notice and hearing, the court may order the taking and preserving of the testimony of any witness who may be unavailable for the adjudicatory hearing or for any other proceeding, or when due to exceptional circumstances, it is in the interests of justice that the witness’ testimony be
preserved;
2) The court shall state on the record the grounds on which the order is
based;
3) The court’s order shall specify the time and place for the taking of the
testimony, the manner in which the testimony shall be recorded and preserved,
and the procedures for custody of the recorded testimony;
4) The testimony shall be taken in the presence of the court, all parties and
their attorneys, unless otherwise ordered; and
5) The court shall rule on the admissibility of the preserved testimony if
it is offered into evidence at the adjudicatory hearing or other judicial proceeding.
B. By Agreement of the Parties.
1) At any time after the commencement of proceedings, the testimony of
any witness may be taken and preserved upon the express written agreement of
all parties;
2) The agreement shall specify the time and place for taking the testimony, the manner in which the testimony shall be recorded and preserved, and
the procedures for custody of the recorded testimony;
3) The testimony shall be taken in the presence of all parties and their
attorneys unless they otherwise agree;
4) The agreement shall be filed with the clerk of courts pursuant to Rule
1345(A); and
5) The court shall rule on the admissibility of the preserved testimony if
it is offered into evidence at the adjudicatory hearing or other judicial proceeding.
Comment
This rule is intended to provide the means by which testimony may be preserved for use at a current or subsequent stage in the proceedings, which includes the taking of a deposition during the
adjudicatory hearing to be used at a later stage of the adjudicatory hearing.
When testimony is to be preserved by video recording, see also Rule 1381.
This rule does not address the admissibility of the preserved testimony. The court is to decide all
questions of admissibility. See Pa.R.E 104(a).
‘‘May be unavailable,’’ as used in paragraph (A)(1), is intended to include situations in which the
court has reason to believe that the witness will be unable to be present or to testify at the adjudicatory hearing or other proceedings, such as when the witness is dying, or will be out of the jurisdiction
and therefore cannot be effectively served with a subpoena, or is elderly, frail, or demonstrates the
symptoms of mental infirmity or dementia, or may become incompetent to testify for any other legally
sufficient reason.
PRE-ADJUDICATORY PROCEDURES 237 Rule 1380
13-17
(384797) No. 507 Feb. 17
Under paragraph (A)(4), the court should preside over the taking of testimony. The court, however,
may order that testimony be taken and preserved without the court’s presence when exigent circumstances exist or the location of the witness renders the court’s presence impracticable. Furthermore,
nothing in this rule is intended to preclude the parties, their attorneys, and the court from agreeing on
the record that the court need not be present. Paragraph (B)(3) permits the parties and their attorneys
to determine among themselves whether the court should be present during the taking of testimony.
That determination should be made a part of the written agreement required by paragraph (B)(1).
Nothing in this rule is intended to preclude the parties from waiving their presence during the taking of testimony.
The means by which the testimony is recorded and preserved are within the discretion of the court
under paragraph (A) and the parties under paragraph (B), and may include the use of electronic or
photographic techniques such as videotape or digital video diskette. There are, however, additional
procedural requirements for preservation of testimony by video recording mandated by Rule 1381.
The party on whose motion testimony is taken should normally have custody of and be responsible
for safeguarding the preserved testimony. That party should also promptly provide a copy of the preserved testimony to the other parties. Additionally, this rule is not intended to conflict with the
requirements of the Pennsylvania Rules of Judicial Administration. For reporting and transcripts by
court-employed reporters, see Pa.R.J.A. Nos. 4001—4016.
When testimony is taken under this rule, the proceeding should afford the parties full opportunity
to examine and cross-examine the witness. Counsel should not reserve objections at the time of the
adjudicatory hearing.
For the definition of ‘‘court,’’ see Rule 1120.

Rule 1381. Preservation of Testimony by Video Recording.
A. When the testimony of a witness is taken and preserved pursuant to Rule
1380 by means of video recording, the testimony shall be recorded simultaneously by a stenographer.
B. The following technical requirements shall be made part of the court
order required by Rule 1380(A) or the written agreement provided in Rule
1380(B):
1) The video recording shall begin with a statement on camera that
includes:
a) the operator’s name and business address;
237 Rule 1381 JUVENILE RULES
13-18
(384798) No. 507 Feb. 17 Copyright  2017 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
b) the name and address of the operator’s employer;
c) the date, time, and place of the video recording;
d) the caption of the case;
e) the name of the witness;
f) the party on whose behalf the witness is testifying; and
g) the nature of the judicial proceedings for which the testimony is
intended;
2) The court and the persons shall identify themselves on camera;
3) The witness shall be sworn on camera;
4) If the length of the testimony requires the use of more than one video
recording, the end of each video recording and the beginning of each succeeding video recording shall be announced on camera;
5) At the conclusion of the witness’ testimony, a statement shall be made
on camera that the testimony is concluded. A statement shall also be made concerning the custody of the video recording(s);
6) Statements concerning stipulations, exhibits, or other pertinent matters
may be made at any time on camera;
7) The video recording shall be timed by a digital clock on camera that
continually shows the hour, minute, and second of the testimony;
8) All objections and the reasons for them shall be made on the record.
When the court presides over the video recording of testimony, the court’s rulings on objections shall also be made on the record;
9) When the court does not preside over the video recording of testimony,
the video recording operator shall keep a log of each objection, referenced to
the time each objection is made. All rulings on objections shall be made before
the video recording is shown at any judicial proceeding; and
10) The original video recording shall not be altered.
Comment
This rule provides the basic technical requirements for taking and preserving testimony by video
recording under Rule 1380. The list of requirements is not intended to be exhaustive. Rather, it is recommended that all recording by video be carefully planned and executed, and that in addition to
complying with the basic requirements, each court order or written agreement for the video recording
of testimony be tailored to the nature of the case and the needs of the persons.
Generally, the camera should focus on the witness to the extent practicable.
Under paragraph (B)(9), the court may rule on objections by either reviewing pertinent sections of
the video recording, aided by the video operator’s log, or by reviewing the stenographic transcript
required by paragraph (A).
Any editing procedure ordered by the court or agreed upon by the persons may be used as long as
it comports with current technology and does not alter the original video recording. Paragraph (B)(10)
is intended to insure preservation of the original video, thereby providing for those situations in which
a dispute arises over editing procedures.
This rule authorizes the use of video recording devices only for the preservation of testimony under
Rule 1380. It is not intended to affect other rules governing recording devices.

Rule 1401. Introduction to Chapter Fourteen.
Under these rules and the Juvenile Act, 42 Pa.C.S. § 6301 et seq., a determination for each case requires separate and distinct findings. First, the court is to
hold an adjudicatory hearing, governed by Rule 1406 or accept stipulations, governed by Rule 1405. Second, after hearing the evidence or accepting the stipulations, the court is to make specific findings on the petition as to each allegation
pursuant to Rule 1408, stating with particularity the allegations proven by clear
and convincing evidence. Third, after entering its findings, the court is to determine if the child is dependent, pursuant to Rule 1409. If aggravated circumstances are alleged, the court is to determine if aggravated circumstances exist,
pursuant to Rule 1705. After the court has made these findings and if the court
finds that the child is dependent, the court is to hold a dispositional hearing as
provided for in Rule 1512 and is to enter a dispositional order under Rule 1515.
Nothing in these rules precludes the court from making these determinations at
the same proceeding as long as the requirements of each rule are followed.

ADJUDICATORY HEARING 237

(326093) No. 390 May 07
Rule 1405. Stipulations.
A. Agreements. At any time after the filing of a petition, any party may
present stipulations or agreements by all parties to the court in writing or orally
on the record to any or all of the following:
1) Findings of fact to be deemed admitted by the parties;
2) A statement of the parties’ agreement for placement;
3) A statement of the parties’ agreement for visitation;
4) Time frame within which the stipulation shall be in effect;
5) Time frame within which court shall review compliance; or
6) Any other stipulation or agreement found to be appropriate by the
court.
B. Court action. The court shall decide whether to accept the stipulations.
1) Court accepts stipulations.
a) Stipulation to all allegations. If the court accepts the stipulations to
all the allegations, the court shall:
i) take additional testimony as necessary to make an independent
determination of dependency; and
ii) enter its findings pursuant to Rule 1408 and an adjudication of
dependency pursuant to Rule 1409.
b) Stipulations to some allegations or agreements for disposition. If the
parties agree to some allegations or placement, visitation, or other disposition
resolutions, the court shall hold an adjudicatory hearing as to the remaining
contested allegations in the petition pursuant to Rule 1406, followed by its
finding on the petition pursuant to Rule 1408 and an adjudication of dependency pursuant to Rule 1409.
2) Court rejects stipulations. If the court rejects the stipulations, the court
shall proceed with an adjudicatory hearing pursuant to Rule 1406, followed by
its findings on the petition pursuant to Rule 1408 and an adjudication of dependency pursuant to Rule 1409.
Comment
If all parties do not agree to all the allegations in the petition, the court is to hold an adjudicatory
hearing as to the remaining allegations pursuant to Rule 1406.
Under paragraph (B)(2), the court may reject the stipulations and proceed to an adjudication of
dependency pursuant to Rule 1406.
The court is to make an independent determination that a child is dependent. Before accepting the
stipulation the judge is to be satisfied that the facts are credible and solidly based and not the product
of speculation as to what the child may do in the future. In re Mark T., 296 Pa. Super. 533, 442 A.2d
1179 (1982). Furthermore, to be accepted by the court, such stipulation is to be joined by all the parties. If accepted by the court, the stipulation has evidentiary value and may be considered alone or in
conjunction with other evidence. The judge is to consider all of the evidence presented as well as the
relevant law to arrive at a reasoned decision regarding dependency. In re Michael Y., 365 Pa. Super.
488, 530 A.2d 115 (1987). See In re A.S., 406 Pa. Super. 466, 594 A.2d 714 (1991) and 42 Pa.C.S.

Rule 1406. Adjudicatory Hearing.
A. Manner of hearing. The court shall conduct the adjudicatory hearing in an
informal but orderly manner.
1) Notification. Prior to commencing the proceedings, the court shall
ascertain:
a) whether notice requirements pursuant to Rules 1360 and 1361 have
been met; and
b) whether unrepresented parties have been informed of the right to
counsel pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 6337.
2) Advanced communication technology. Upon good cause shown, a court
may utilize advanced communication technology pursuant to Rule 1129.
B. Recording. The adjudicatory hearing shall be recorded.
C. Evidence. Each party shall be given the opportunity to:
1) introduce evidence;
2) present testimony; and
3) to cross-examine any witness.
Comment
Due process requires that the litigants receive notice of the issues before the court and an opportunity to present their case in relation to those issues. In re M.B., 356 Pa. Super. 257, 514 A.2d 599
(1986), aff’d, 517 Pa. 459, 538 A.2d 495 (1988).
Pursuant to paragraph (A)(2), it is expected that the parties be present. Only upon good cause
shown should advanced communication technology be utilized.
A full record of the hearing is to be kept. In re J.H., 788 A.2d 1006 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2001). See also
42 Pa.C.S. § 6336.
Under paragraph (B), notes of testimony should be provided to counsel for a party upon good cause
shown. The court may place conditions of release on the notes of testimony. When an appeal is taken,
the record is to be transcribed pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1922. See Pa.R.A.P. 1911 for request of transcript.
Under paragraph (C), the court is to receive evidence from all interested parties and from objective, disinterested witnesses. The judge’s findings should be supported by a full discussion of the evidence. See In Re Clouse, 244 Pa. Super. 396, 368 A.2d 780 (1976).

Rule 1409. Adjudication of Dependency and Court Order.
(a) Adjudicating the Child Dependent. Once the court has made its findings
under Rule 1408, the court shall enter an order whether the child is dependent.
(1) Dependency. If the court finds from clear and convincing evidence that
the child is dependent, the court shall proceed to a dispositional hearing under
Rule 1512.

14-4
(422202) No. 605 Apr. 25 Copyright  2025 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
(2) No Dependency. If the court finds the child not to be dependent or the
court finds a parent ready, willing, and able to provide proper parental care or
control, the court shall:
(i) dismiss the petition;
(ii) order the child to be discharged from custody and any restrictions
ordered in the proceedings; and
(iii) enter an order identifying individual(s) who will have the legal and
physical custody until such order is modified by further order of the court.
(b) Timing.
(1) Child in Custody. If a child is removed from the home, the court shall
enter an adjudication of dependency within seven days of the adjudicatory
hearing and enter its findings pursuant to Rule 1408.
(2) Child Not in Custody. If a child is not removed from the home and if
the court fails to enter an order of dependency, the court shall hold a status
hearing every 30 days.
(c) Court Order. The court shall include the following in its court order:
(1) A statement pursuant to subdivision (a):
(i) as to whether the court finds the child to be dependent from clear
and convincing evidence;
(ii) including the specific factual findings that form the bases of the
court’s decision;
(iii) including any legal determinations made; and
(2) Any orders directing the removal of a child from the home or change
in the current residential status, including:
(i) orders as to placement;
(ii) visitation; or
(iii) change in custody; and
(3) Any orders as to any aids in disposition that may assist in the preparation of the dispositional hearing, including orders regarding family finding.
(4) Whether there is reason to know the child is an Indian child pursuant
to Rule 1203.
Comment:
Before the court can find a child to be dependent, there must be clear and convincing evidence in
support of the petition. The burden of proof is on the petitioner. The court’s inquiry is to be comprehensive, and its findings are to be supported by specific findings of fact and a full discussion of the
evidence. In re LaRue, 366 A.2d 1271 (Pa. Super. 1976). See also In re Frank W.D., Jr., 462 A.2d
708 (Pa. Super. 1983); In re Clouse, 368 A.2d 780 (Pa. Super. 1976). The evidence must support that
the child is dependent. In the Matter of DeSavage, 360 A.2d 237 (Pa. Super. 1976). The court must
apply the clear and convincing evidence standard (not the best interest of the child standard) that the
child is dependent per the requirements of the Juvenile Act, 42 Pa.C.S. § 6341(c). In re Haynes, 473
A.2d 1365 (Pa. Super. 1983). A child, whose non-custodial parent is ready, willing, and able to provide adequate care for the child, cannot be found dependent on the basis of lacking proper parental
care and control. In re M.L., 757 A.2d 849 (Pa. 2000). A trial court has the authority to transfer custody or modify custody to the child’s non-custodial parent without a finding of dependency if sufficient evidence of dependency would have existed but for the availability of the non-custodial parent.
In re Justin S., 543 A.2d 1192 (Pa. Super. 1988).
The court is to specify which allegations in the petition are the bases for the finding of dependency
pursuant to Rule 1408. The court is to make an adjudication of dependency based upon the allegaADJUDICATORY HEARING 237 Rule 1409
14-5
(422203) No. 605 Apr. 25
tions in the petition, not on alternative grounds. Due process and fundamental fairness require
adequate notice of the allegations to afford a reasonable opportunity to prepare a defense. In re R.M.,
790 A.2d 300 (Pa. 2002).
Under subdivision (c)(3), aids in disposition may include, but are not limited to, any services,
investigations, evaluations, studies, treatment plans, and any other appropriate reports that may aid the
court in making its determination at the dispositional hearing. See 42 Pa.C.S. § 6339 for orders of a
social study or physical and mental examinations and treatment.
See also 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 6341 (Adjudication) and 6302 (Definitions).
Pursuant to subdivision (c)(3), when making its determination for reasonable efforts made by the
county agency, the court is to consider the extent to which the county agency has fulfilled its obligation pursuant to Rule 1149 regarding family finding. See also Rule 1242(c)(2), (c)(3)(ii)-(c)(3)(iii),
Rule 1330(b)(6), and Comments to Rules 1242, 1330, 1515, and 1608—1611 for reasonable efforts
determinations.
If the requirements of Rule 1149 regarding family finding have not been met, the court is to make
necessary orders to ensure compliance by enforcing this legislative mandate. See 67 Pa.C.S. §§ 7501
et seq. See also Pa.R.J.C.P. 1242(e)(3) and 1609(D), and Comments to Pa.R.J.C.P. 1242, 1408, 1512,

Comment:
To the extent practicable, the judge or juvenile court hearing officer that presided over the adjudicatory hearing for a child should preside over the dispositional hearing for the same child.
Paragraph (A)(2) does not infringe on the right to call witnesses to testify, in addition to those
specified individuals. See Rule 1123 for subpoenaing a witness.
Pursuant to paragraph (A)(3), it is expected that the parties be present. Only upon good cause
shown should advanced communication technology be utilized.
Pursuant to paragraph (C), the court is to advise the parties of their appellate rights orally in the
courtroom on the record. The court is to explain the right to appointed counsel for an appeal if a party
is without counsel, and without the financial resources or otherwise unable to employ counsel. See 42
Pa.C.S. § 6337; see also Rule 1150(B) for duration of counsel and Rule 1151 for assignment of
counsel.
All the findings made in open court are to be placed in writing through the court’s dispositional
order pursuant to Rule 1515. Nothing in this rule is intended to preclude the court from further
explaining its findings in its dispositional order. In addition to the findings pursuant to paragraph (D),
see Rule 1514 for dispositional findings before removal from the home.
Pursuant to paragraph (D)(1)(f), the court is to determine the permanency plan for the child. A permanency plan should include two plans or goals: the primary plan and the secondary or concurrent
plan.
237 Rule 1512 JUVENILE RULES
15-4
(414854) No. 587 Oct. 23 Copyright  2023 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
The primary plan is the comprehensive plan developed to achieve the permanency goal. The secondary or concurrent plan is developed and initiated so that if the primary plan is not fulfilled, timely
permanency for the child may still be achieved. These two plans are to be simultaneously addressed
by the county agency.
Rule 1608 mandates permanency hearings at least every six months. It is best practice to have
three-month hearings to ensure permanency is achieved in a timely fashion and the court is informed
of the progress of the case. See Comment to Rule 1608.
Pursuant to subdivision (D)(1)(h), the court is to determine whether the county agency has reasonably satisfied the requirements of Rule 1149 regarding family finding. If the county agency has failed
to meet the diligent family finding efforts requirements of Rule 1149, the court is to utilize its powers
to enforce this legislative mandate. See 67 Pa.C.S. §§ 7501 et seq. See also Pa.R.J.C.P. 1210(D)(8),
1242(E)(3), 1409(C), 1609(D), and 1611(C), and Comments to Pa.R.J.C.P. 1242, 1408, 1409, 1514,
1515, and 1608—1611.
Pursuant to subdivision (D)(1)(i), the court is to address the child’s educational stability, including
the right to an educational decision maker, 42 Pa.C.S. § 6301, 20 U.S.C. § 1439(a)(5), and 34 C.F.R.
§ 300.519. The court’s findings should address the child’s right to: 1) educational stability, including
the right to: a) remain in the same school regardless of a change in placement when it is in the child’s
best interest; b) immediate enrollment when a school change is in the child’s best interest; and c) have
school proximity considered in all placement changes, 42 U.S.C. §§ 675(1)(G) and 11431 et seq.; 2)
an educational decision maker pursuant to Rule 1147, 42 Pa.C.S. § 6301, 20 U.S.C. § 1439(a)(5),
and 34 C.F.R. § 300.519; 3) an appropriate education, including any necessary special education,
early intervention, or remedial services pursuant to 24 P.S. §§ 13-1371 and 13-1372, 55 Pa. Code
§ 3130.87, and 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400 et seq.; 4) the educational services necessary to support the child’s
transition to successful adulthood pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 6351 if the child is 14 or older; and 5) a
transition plan that addresses the child’s educational needs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 675(5)(H) if the
child will age out of care within 90 days.
Pursuant to paragraph (D)(1)(j), the court is to address the child’s needs concerning health care and
disability. The court’s findings should address the right of: 1) a child to receive timely and medically
appropriate screenings and health care services pursuant to 55 Pa. Code §§ 3700.51 and 3800.32, and
42 U.S.C. § 1396d(r); 2) a child to a transition plan that addresses the child’s health care needs, and
includes specific options for how the child can obtain health insurance after leaving care pursuant to
42 U.S.C. § 675(5)(H) if the child will age out of care within 90 days; and 3) a child with disabilities
to receive necessary accommodations pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 12132; 28 C.F.R. § 35.101 et seq.,
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. § 794, and implementing regulations at 45 C.F.R. § 84.1 et seq. In addition, the court is to ensure progress and compliance with the
child’s case plan for the ongoing oversight and coordination of health care services under 42 U.S.C.
§ 622(b)(15).
Pursuant to the Juvenile Act, the court has authority to order a physical or mental examination of
a child and medical or surgical treatment of a minor, who is suffering from a serious physical condition or illness which requires prompt treatment in the opinion of a physician. The court may order the
treatment even if the guardians have not been given notice of the pending hearing, are not available,
or without good cause inform the court that they do not consent to the treatment. 42 Pa.C.S.
§ 6339(b).
Pursuant to paragraph (D)(1)(k), the court is to include siblings in its visitation schedule. See 42
U.S.C. § 671(a)(31), which requires reasonable efforts be made to place siblings together unless it is
contrary to the safety or well-being of either sibling and that frequent visitation be assured if joint
placement cannot be made.

Rule 1514. Dispositional Finding Before Removal from Home.
(a) Required Findings. Prior to entering a dispositional order removing a
child from the home, the court shall state on the record in open court the following specific findings:
1) Continuation of the child in the home would be contrary to the welfare,
safety, or health of the child;
2) The child’s placement is the least restrictive placement that meets the
needs of the child, supported by reasons why there is no less restrictive alternative available;
3) If the child has a sibling who is subject to removal from the home,
whether reasonable efforts were made prior to the placement of the child to
place the siblings together or whether such joint placement is contrary to the
safety or well-being of the child or sibling;
4) The county agency has reasonably satisfied the requirements of Rule
1149 regarding family finding;
5) One of the following:
(i) Reasonable efforts were made prior to the placement of the child to
prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from the home, if the
child has remained in the home pending such disposition; or
(ii) If preventive services were not offered due to the necessity for
emergency placement, whether such lack of services was reasonable under
the circumstances; or
(iii) If the court previously determined that reasonable efforts were not
made to prevent the initial removal of the child from the home, whether reasonable efforts are under way to make it possible for the child to return
home; and
6) The county agency has provided a permanency plan and services pursuant to 67 Pa.C.S. § 7504.
(b) Aggravated Circumstances. If the court has previously found aggravated
circumstances to exist and that reasonable efforts to remove the child from the
home or to preserve and reunify the family are not required, a finding pursuant
to subdivision (a)(5)(i)—(a)(5)(iii) is unnecessary.
Comment:
See 42 Pa.C.S. § 6351(b).
Pursuant to subdivision (a)(3), the court is to utilize reasonable efforts in placing siblings together
unless it is contrary to the safety or well-being of a child or sibling. See 42 U.S.C. § 675 (Fostering
Connections).
Pursuant to subdivision (a)(4), the court is to determine whether the county agency has reasonably
satisfied the requirements of Rule 1149 regarding family finding. If the county agency has failed to
meet the diligent family finding efforts requirements of Rule 1149, the court is to utilize its powers
to enforce this legislative mandate. See 67 Pa.C.S. §§ 7501 et seq. See also Pa.R.J.C.P. 1210(D)(8),
1242(E)(3), 1409(C), 1609(D), and 1611(C), and Comments to Pa.R.J.C.P. 1242, 1408, 1409, 1512,
1515, and 1608—1611.
Pursuant to subdivision (a)(6), specific requirements for a permanency plan and services exist when
the court orders the temporary transfer of a child’s legal custody pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 6351(a)(2).
See 67 Pa.C.S. § 7504.

Rule 1515. Dispositional Order.
A. Generally. When the court enters a disposition, the court shall issue a
written order, which provides that the disposition is best suited to the safety, protection, and physical, mental, and moral welfare of the child. The order shall
include:
1) any findings pursuant to Rules 1512(D) and 1514;
2) the date of the order; and
3) the signature and printed name of the judge entering the order.
B. Transfer of custody. If the court decides to transfer custody of the child to
a person or agency found to be qualified to provide care, shelter, and supervision
of the child, the dispositional order shall include:
1) the name and address of such person or agency, unless the court determines disclosure is inappropriate;
2) the limitations of the order, including the type of custody granted; and
3) any visitation rights.
C. Guardian. The dispositional order shall include any conditions, limitations, restrictions, and obligations imposed upon the guardian.
Comment:
See 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 6310, 6351.
When issuing a dispositional order, the court should issue an order that is ‘‘best suited to the safety,
protection, and physical, mental, and moral welfare of the child.’’ 42 Pa.C.S. § 6351(a). See In re S.J.,
906 A.2d 547, 551 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2006) (citing In re Tameka M., 525 Pa. 348, 580 A.2d 750 (1990)),
for issues addressing a child’s mental and moral welfare.
When making its determination for reasonable efforts made by the county agency, the court is to
consider the extent to which the county agency has fulfilled its obligation pursuant to Rule 1149
regarding family finding. See also Rules 1240(B)(6), 1242(C)(2) & (3)(b) & (c), and 1330(B)(6) and
Comments to Rules 1242, 1330, 1409, 1608, 1609, 1610, and 1611 for reasonable efforts determinations.
If the requirements of Rule 1149 regarding family finding have not been met, the court is to make
necessary orders to ensure compliance by enforcing this legislative mandate. See 67 Pa.C.S. §§ 7501
et seq. See also Pa.R.J.C.P. 1210(D)(8), 1242(E)(3), 1409(C), 1609(D), and 1611(C), and Comments
to Pa.R.J.C.P. 1242, 1408, 1409, 1512, 1514, and 1608—1611. 45 C.R.F. § 1356.21 provides a specific foster care provider may not be placed in a court order to be in compliance with and receive
funding through the Federal Financial Participation.
Dispositional orders should comport in substantial form and content to the model orders to receive
funding under the federal Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) of 1997 (P. L. 105-89). The model
forms are also in compliance with Title IV-B and Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. For model
orders, see http://www.pacourts.us/forms/dependency-forms.

Comment:
To the extent practicable, the judge or juvenile court hearing officer that presided over the adjudicatory hearing for a child should preside over the dispositional hearing for the same child.
Paragraph (A)(2) does not infringe on the right to call witnesses to testify, in addition to those
specified individuals. See Rule 1123 for subpoenaing a witness.
Pursuant to paragraph (A)(3), it is expected that the parties be present. Only upon good cause
shown should advanced communication technology be utilized.
Pursuant to paragraph (C), the court is to advise the parties of their appellate rights orally in the
courtroom on the record. The court is to explain the right to appointed counsel for an appeal if a party
is without counsel, and without the financial resources or otherwise unable to employ counsel. See 42
Pa.C.S. § 6337; see also Rule 1150(B) for duration of counsel and Rule 1151 for assignment of
counsel.
All the findings made in open court are to be placed in writing through the court’s dispositional
order pursuant to Rule 1515. Nothing in this rule is intended to preclude the court from further
explaining its findings in its dispositional order. In addition to the findings pursuant to paragraph (D),
see Rule 1514 for dispositional findings before removal from the home.
Pursuant to paragraph (D)(1)(f), the court is to determine the permanency plan for the child. A permanency plan should include two plans or goals: the primary plan and the secondary or concurrent
plan.
237 Rule 1512 JUVENILE RULES
15-4
(414854) No. 587 Oct. 23 Copyright  2023 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
The primary plan is the comprehensive plan developed to achieve the permanency goal. The secondary or concurrent plan is developed and initiated so that if the primary plan is not fulfilled, timely
permanency for the child may still be achieved. These two plans are to be simultaneously addressed
by the county agency.
Rule 1608 mandates permanency hearings at least every six months. It is best practice to have
three-month hearings to ensure permanency is achieved in a timely fashion and the court is informed
of the progress of the case. See Comment to Rule 1608.
Pursuant to subdivision (D)(1)(h), the court is to determine whether the county agency has reasonably satisfied the requirements of Rule 1149 regarding family finding. If the county agency has failed
to meet the diligent family finding efforts requirements of Rule 1149, the court is to utilize its powers
to enforce this legislative mandate. See 67 Pa.C.S. §§ 7501 et seq. See also Pa.R.J.C.P. 1210(D)(8),
1242(E)(3), 1409(C), 1609(D), and 1611(C), and Comments to Pa.R.J.C.P. 1242, 1408, 1409, 1514,
1515, and 1608—1611.
Pursuant to subdivision (D)(1)(i), the court is to address the child’s educational stability, including
the right to an educational decision maker, 42 Pa.C.S. § 6301, 20 U.S.C. § 1439(a)(5), and 34 C.F.R.
§ 300.519. The court’s findings should address the child’s right to: 1) educational stability, including
the right to: a) remain in the same school regardless of a change in placement when it is in the child’s
best interest; b) immediate enrollment when a school change is in the child’s best interest; and c) have
school proximity considered in all placement changes, 42 U.S.C. §§ 675(1)(G) and 11431 et seq.; 2)
an educational decision maker pursuant to Rule 1147, 42 Pa.C.S. § 6301, 20 U.S.C. § 1439(a)(5),
and 34 C.F.R. § 300.519; 3) an appropriate education, including any necessary special education,
early intervention, or remedial services pursuant to 24 P.S. §§ 13-1371 and 13-1372, 55 Pa. Code
§ 3130.87, and 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400 et seq.; 4) the educational services necessary to support the child’s
transition to successful adulthood pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 6351 if the child is 14 or older; and 5) a
transition plan that addresses the child’s educational needs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 675(5)(H) if the
child will age out of care within 90 days.
Pursuant to paragraph (D)(1)(j), the court is to address the child’s needs concerning health care and
disability. The court’s findings should address the right of: 1) a child to receive timely and medically
appropriate screenings and health care services pursuant to 55 Pa. Code §§ 3700.51 and 3800.32, and
42 U.S.C. § 1396d(r); 2) a child to a transition plan that addresses the child’s health care needs, and
includes specific options for how the child can obtain health insurance after leaving care pursuant to
42 U.S.C. § 675(5)(H) if the child will age out of care within 90 days; and 3) a child with disabilities
to receive necessary accommodations pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 12132; 28 C.F.R. § 35.101 et seq.,
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. § 794, and implementing regulations at 45 C.F.R. § 84.1 et seq. In addition, the court is to ensure progress and compliance with the
child’s case plan for the ongoing oversight and coordination of health care services under 42 U.S.C.
§ 622(b)(15).
Pursuant to the Juvenile Act, the court has authority to order a physical or mental examination of
a child and medical or surgical treatment of a minor, who is suffering from a serious physical condition or illness which requires prompt treatment in the opinion of a physician. The court may order the
treatment even if the guardians have not been given notice of the pending hearing, are not available,
or without good cause inform the court that they do not consent to the treatment. 42 Pa.C.S.
§ 6339(b).
Pursuant to paragraph (D)(1)(k), the court is to include siblings in its visitation schedule. See 42
U.S.C. § 671(a)(31), which requires reasonable efforts be made to place siblings together unless it is
contrary to the safety or well-being of either sibling and that frequent visitation be assured if joint
placement cannot be made.
See Rule 1127 for recording and transcribing of proceedings.
See Rule 1136 for ex parte communications.

Rule 1514. Dispositional Finding Before Removal from Home.
(a) Required Findings. Prior to entering a dispositional order removing a
child from the home, the court shall state on the record in open court the following specific findings:
1) Continuation of the child in the home would be contrary to the welfare,
safety, or health of the child;
2) The child’s placement is the least restrictive placement that meets the
needs of the child, supported by reasons why there is no less restrictive alternative available;
3) If the child has a sibling who is subject to removal from the home,
whether reasonable efforts were made prior to the placement of the child to
place the siblings together or whether such joint placement is contrary to the
safety or well-being of the child or sibling;
4) The county agency has reasonably satisfied the requirements of Rule
1149 regarding family finding;
5) One of the following:
(i) Reasonable efforts were made prior to the placement of the child to
prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from the home, if the
child has remained in the home pending such disposition; or
(ii) If preventive services were not offered due to the necessity for
emergency placement, whether such lack of services was reasonable under
the circumstances; or
(iii) If the court previously determined that reasonable efforts were not
made to prevent the initial removal of the child from the home, whether reasonable efforts are under way to make it possible for the child to return
home; and
6) The county agency has provided a permanency plan and services pursuant to 67 Pa.C.S. § 7504.
(b) Aggravated Circumstances. If the court has previously found aggravated
circumstances to exist and that reasonable efforts to remove the child from the
home or to preserve and reunify the family are not required, a finding pursuant
to subdivision (a)(5)(i)—(a)(5)(iii) is unnecessary.
Comment:
See 42 Pa.C.S. § 6351(b).
Pursuant to subdivision (a)(3), the court is to utilize reasonable efforts in placing siblings together
unless it is contrary to the safety or well-being of a child or sibling. See 42 U.S.C. § 675 (Fostering
Connections).
Pursuant to subdivision (a)(4), the court is to determine whether the county agency has reasonably
satisfied the requirements of Rule 1149 regarding family finding. If the county agency has failed to
meet the diligent family finding efforts requirements of Rule 1149, the court is to utilize its powers
to enforce this legislative mandate. See 67 Pa.C.S. §§ 7501 et seq. See also Pa.R.J.C.P. 1210(D)(8),
1242(E)(3), 1409(C), 1609(D), and 1611(C), and Comments to Pa.R.J.C.P. 1242, 1408, 1409, 1512,
1515, and 1608—1611.
Pursuant to subdivision (a)(6), specific requirements for a permanency plan and services exist when
the court orders the temporary transfer of a child’s legal custody pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 6351(a)(2).
See 67 Pa.C.S. § 7504.

Rule 1515. Dispositional Order.
A. Generally. When the court enters a disposition, the court shall issue a
written order, which provides that the disposition is best suited to the safety, protection, and physical, mental, and moral welfare of the child. The order shall
include:
1) any findings pursuant to Rules 1512(D) and 1514;
2) the date of the order; and
3) the signature and printed name of the judge entering the order.
B. Transfer of custody. If the court decides to transfer custody of the child to
a person or agency found to be qualified to provide care, shelter, and supervision
of the child, the dispositional order shall include:
1) the name and address of such person or agency, unless the court determines disclosure is inappropriate;
2) the limitations of the order, including the type of custody granted; and
3) any visitation rights.
C. Guardian. The dispositional order shall include any conditions, limitations, restrictions, and obligations imposed upon the guardian.
Comment:
See 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 6310, 6351.
When issuing a dispositional order, the court should issue an order that is ‘‘best suited to the safety,
protection, and physical, mental, and moral welfare of the child.’’ 42 Pa.C.S. § 6351(a). See In re S.J.,
906 A.2d 547, 551 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2006) (citing In re Tameka M., 525 Pa. 348, 580 A.2d 750 (1990)),
for issues addressing a child’s mental and moral welfare.
When making its determination for reasonable efforts made by the county agency, the court is to
consider the extent to which the county agency has fulfilled its obligation pursuant to Rule 1149
regarding family finding. See also Rules 1240(B)(6), 1242(C)(2) & (3)(b) & (c), and 1330(B)(6) and
Comments to Rules 1242, 1330, 1409, 1608, 1609, 1610, and 1611 for reasonable efforts determinations.
If the requirements of Rule 1149 regarding family finding have not been met, the court is to make
necessary orders to ensure compliance by enforcing this legislative mandate. See 67 Pa.C.S. §§ 7501
et seq. See also Pa.R.J.C.P. 1210(D)(8), 1242(E)(3), 1409(C), 1609(D), and 1611(C), and Comments
to Pa.R.J.C.P. 1242, 1408, 1409, 1512, 1514, and 1608—1611. 45 C.R.F. § 1356.21 provides a specific foster care provider may not be placed in a court order to be in compliance with and receive
funding through the Federal Financial Participation.
Dispositional orders should comport in substantial form and content to the model orders to receive
funding under the federal Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) of 1997 (P. L. 105-89). The model
forms are also in compliance with Title IV-B and Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. For model
orders, see http://www.pacourts.us/forms/dependency-forms.

Rule
1800. Suspensions of Acts of Assembly.
Rule 1800. Suspensions of Acts of Assembly.
This rule provides for the suspension of the following Acts of Assembly that
apply to dependency proceedings only:
1) The Act of July 9, 1976, P. L. 586, No. 142, § 2, 42 Pa.C.S. § 6335(c),
which provides for the issuance of arrest warrants if the child may abscond or
may not attend or be brought to a hearing, is suspended only insofar as the Act
is inconsistent with Rules 1124, 1140, and 1364, which require a summoned
person to fail to appear and the court to find that sufficient notice was given.
2) The Act of July 9, 1976, P. L. 586, No. 142, § 2, 42 Pa.C.S. § 6336(c),
which provides that if a proceeding is not recorded, full minutes shall be kept

1127(A) & 1242(B)(2), which require all proceedings to be recorded, except
for shelter care hearings.
3) The Act of July 9, 1976, P. L. 586, No. 142, § 2, 42 Pa.C.S.
§ 6311(b)(9), which provides that there is not a conflict of interest for the
guardian ad litem in communicating the child’s wishes and the recommendation relating to the appropriateness and safety of the child’s placement and services necessary to address the child’s needs and safety, is suspended only insofar as the Act is inconsistent with Rules 1151 and 1154, which allows for
appointment of separate legal counsel and a guardian ad litem when the guardian ad litem determines there is a conflict of interest between the child’s legal
interest and best interest.
4) The Act of July 9, 1976, P. L. 586, No. 142, § 2, 42 Pa.C.S. § 6337,
which provides that counsel must be provided unless the guardian is present
and waives counsel for the child, is suspended only insofar as the Act is inconsistent with Rule 1152, which does not allow a guardian to waive the child’s
right to counsel and a child may not waive the right to a guardian ad litem.
5) The Act of July 9, 1976, P. L. 586, No. 142, § 2, 42 Pa.C.S. § 6305(b),
which provides that the court may direct hearings in any case or classes of
cases be conducted by the juvenile court hearing officer, is suspended only

hearing officers to hear only specific classes of cases.
6) The Act of July 9, 1976, P. L. 586, No. 142, § 2, 42 Pa.C.S. § 6324,

for police officers and juvenile probation officers taking a child into custody.
7) The Act of July 9, 1976, P. L. 586, No. 142, § 2, 42 Pa.C.S. § 6331,

SUSPENSIONS 237

(387449) No. 514 Sep. 17
hours or the next business day of the admission of the child to shelter care, is
suspended only insofar as the Act is inconsistent with the filing of a petition
within twenty-four hours or the next business day from the shelter care hearing
if the child is in protective custody under Rules 1242 and 1330(A).
8) The Act of July 9, 1976, P. L. 586, No. 142, § 2, 42 Pa.C.S. § 6334,
which provides that any person may bring a petition, is suspended only insofar
as the Act is inconsistent with Rules 1320, 1321, and 1330, which provide that
the county agency may file a petition and any other person shall file an application to file a petition.
9) The Act of December 19, 1990, P. L. 1240, No. 206, § 2, 23 Pa.C.S.
§ 6339, which provides for the confidentiality of reports made pursuant to the
Child Protective Services Law, 23 Pa.C.S. § 6301 et seq., is suspended only
insofar as the Law is inconsistent with Rule 1340(B)(1)(e), which provides for
the disclosure of such reports if the reports are going to be used as evidence in
a hearing to prove dependency of a child.
10) The Act of July 9, 1976, P. L. 586, No. 142, § 2, 42 Pa.C.S. § 6335,
which provides that a copy of the petition is to accompany a summons, is suspended only insofar as the Act is inconsistent with Rule 1360, which provides
that the summons is to include a copy of the petition unless the petition has
been previously served.
11) The Act of July 9, 1976, P. L. 586, No. 142, § 2, 42 Pa.C.S.
§ 6336.1(b)(2), which provides that the foster parent or parents, preadoptive
parent or relative providing care for the child has a right to submit a report to
the court, is suspended only insofar as the Act is inconsistent with Rule 1604,
which requires the report to be submitted to a court designee who files the
report and submits it to the judge, attorneys, parties, and if appointed, a court
appointed special advocate.
12) The Act of July 9, 1976, P. L. 586, No. 142, § 2, 42 Pa.C.S.
§ 6351(e)(3)(i)(B), which provides for permanency hearings within six months
of each previous permanency hearing until the child is returned home or
removed from the jurisdiction of the court, is suspended only insofar as the Act
is inconsistent with Rule 1607, which requires permanency hearings in all cases
until the child is removed from the jurisdiction of the court.

§ 10(c) of the Pennsylvania Constitution. See also Rule 1102.

major subdivisions as may be required for clarity of expression
and uniformity of style.
(b) Chapters.--The principal subdivisions of a part, or of
a title that is not divided into parts, of this act are
chapters, comprising the sections relating to the part or title,
as the case may be, embraced in the heading of the chapter.
Chapters of this act are identified by Arabic numerals beginning
with each title.
(c) Sections and minor subdivisions.--Sections of this act
are identified by Arabic numerals beginning with each title.
Chapters shall consist of no more than 99 sections. The last
two digits in the section numbers shall indicate the sequence
of sections within a chapter, and the digit or digits preceding
such digits shall indicate the number of the chapter. A section
of this act is subdivided into subsections, paragraphs,

When reference is made in this act to a provision contained

of the provisions cited shall be inserted immediately following
the first occurrence of the citation in the section and
following any reoccurrence of the citation which is preceded
in the same section or relevant part thereof by a citation to
a different section of this act. Where required for clarity in
the case of cross references to subsections or other parts of
a section, the cross reference description shall be based on
the subject matter of the subsection or other part thereof
referred to.
Cross References. Section 303 is referred to in sections
102, 502 of this title.
§ 304. References to other statutes.
(a) Method and scope of reference.--Acts of the General
Assembly shall be referred to generically in this act as
statutes and, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise,
such term when used in this act shall be deemed to be also a
general reference to the provisions of this act.
(b) Form of citation.--Without prejudice to any other form
of citation, any statute, except a provision of this act, shall
be cited in this act by reference to its date of enactment, the
special session number, if any, the page and act number, if
any, assigned in the Laws of Pennsylvania and its statutory

or amendment to another statute and shall draft the bill

§ 1921. Legislative intent controls.
(a) Object and scope of construction of statutes.--The
object of all interpretation and construction of statutes is
to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General
Assembly. Every statute shall be construed, if possible, to
give effect to all its provisions.
(b) Unambiguous words control construction.--When the words
of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter
of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing
its spirit.
(c) Matters considered in ascertaining intent.--When the
words of a statute are not explicit, the intention of the
General Assembly may be ascertained by considering, among other
matters:
(1) The occasion and necessity for the statute.
(2) The circumstances under which it was enacted.
(3) The mischief to be remedied.
(4) The object to be attained.
(5) The former law, if any, including other statutes
upon the same or similar subjects.
(6) The consequences of a particular interpretation.
(7) The contemporaneous legislative history.
(8) Legislative and administrative interpretations of
such statute.
§ 1922. Presumptions in ascertaining legislative intent.
In ascertaining the intention of the General Assembly in the
enactment of a statute the following presumptions, among others,
may be used:
(1) That the General Assembly does not intend a result
that is absurd, impossible of execution or unreasonable.
(2) That the General Assembly intends the entire statute
to be effective and certain.
(3) That the General Assembly does not intend to violate
the Constitution of the United States or of this
Commonwealth.
(4) That when a court of last resort has construed the
language used in a statute, the General Assembly in
subsequent statutes on the same subject matter intends the
same construction to be placed upon such language.
(5) That the General Assembly intends to favor the
public interest as against any private interest.
§ 1923. Grammar and punctuation of statutes.
(a) Grammatical errors and transposition of
words.--Grammatical errors shall not vitiate a statute. A
transposition of words and clauses may be resorted to where a
sentence is without meaning as it stands.
(b) Use of punctuation in construction.--In no case shall
the punctuation of a statute control or affect the intention
of the General Assembly in the enactment thereof but punctuation
may be used to aid in the construction thereof if the statute
was finally enacted after December 31, 1964.
(c) Adding words for proper construction.--Words and phrases
which may be necessary to the proper interpretation of a statute
and which do not conflict with its obvious purpose and intent,
nor in any way affect its scope and operation, may be added in
the construction thereof.
(Dec. 10, 1974, P.L.816, No.271, eff. imd.)
1974 Amendment. Act 271 amended subsec. (b).
§ 1924. Construction of titles, preambles, provisos, exceptions
and headings.
The title and preamble of a statute may be considered in the
construction thereof. Provisos shall be construed to limit
rather than to extend the operation of the clauses to which
they refer. Exceptions expressed in a statute shall be construed
to exclude all others. The headings prefixed to titles, parts,
articles, chapters, sections and other divisions of a statute
shall not be considered to control but may be used to aid in
the construction thereof.
Cross References. Section 1924 is referred to in section
1107 of Title 13 (Commercial Code).
§ 1925. Constitutional construction of statutes.
The provisions of every statute shall be severable. If any
provision of any statute or the application thereof to any
person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the
statute, and the application of such provision to other persons
or circumstances, shall not be affected thereby, unless the
court finds that the valid provisions of the statute are so
essentially and inseparably connected with, and so depend upon,
the void provision or application, that it cannot be presumed
the General Assembly would have enacted the remaining valid
provisions without the void one; or unless the court finds that
the remaining valid provisions, standing alone, are incomplete
and are incapable of being executed in accordance with the
legislative intent.
§ 1926. Presumption against retroactive effect.
No statute shall be construed to be retroactive unless
clearly and manifestly so intended by the General Assembly.
§ 1927. Construction of uniform laws.
Statutes uniform with those of other states shall be
interpreted and construed to effect their general purpose to
make uniform the laws of those states which enact them.
§ 1928. Rule of strict and liberal construction.
(a) Statutes in derogation of common law.--The rule that
statutes in derogation of the common law are to be strictly
construed, shall have no application to the statutes of this
Commonwealth enacted finally after September 1, 1937.
(b) Provisions subject to strict construction.--All
provisions of a statute of the classes hereafter enumerated
shall be strictly construed:
(1) Penal provisions.
(2) Retroactive provisions.
(3) Provisions imposing taxes.
(4) Provisions conferring the power of eminent domain.
(5) Provisions exempting persons and property from
taxation.
(6) Provisions exempting property from the power of
eminent domain.
(7) Provisions decreasing the jurisdiction of a court
of record.
(8) Provisions enacted finally prior to September 1,
1937 which are in derogation of the common law.
(c) Provisions subject to liberal construction.--All other
provisions of a statute shall be liberally construed to effect
their objects and to promote justice.
§ 1929. Penalties no bar to civil remedies.
The provision in any statute for a penalty or forfeiture for
its violation shall not be construed to deprive an injured
person of the right to recover from the offender damages
sustained by reason of the violation of such statute.
§ 1930. Penalties for each offense.
Whenever a penalty or forfeiture is provided for the
violation of a statute, such penalty or forfeiture shall be
construed to be for each such violation.
§ 1931. Intent to defraud.
Whenever an intent to defraud is required in any statute in
order to constitute an offense, the statute shall be construed
to require only an intent to defraud any person or body politic.
§ 1932. Statutes in pari materia.
(a) Meaning.--Statutes or parts of statutes are in pari
materia when they relate to the same persons or things or to
the same class of persons or things.
(b) Construction.--Statutes in pari materia shall be
construed together, if possible, as one statute.
§ 1933. Particular controls general.
Whenever a general provision in a statute shall be in
conflict with a special provision in the same or another
statute, the two shall be construed, if possible, so that effect
may be given to both. If the conflict between the two provisions
is irreconcilable, the special provisions shall prevail and
shall be construed as an exception to the general provision,
unless the general provision shall be enacted later and it shall
be the manifest intention of the General Assembly that such
general provision shall prevail.
Cross References. Section 1933 is referred to in section
1934 of this title; section 9303 of Title 42 (Judiciary and
Judicial Procedure).
§ 1934. Irreconcilable clauses in the same statute.

to particular controls general), whenever, in the same statute,
several clauses are irreconcilable, the clause last in order
of date or position shall prevail.
§ 1935. Irreconcilable statutes passed by same General
Assembly.
Whenever the provisions of two or more statutes enacted
finally during the same General Assembly are irreconcilable,
the statute latest in date of final enactment, and where two
or more irreconcilable statutes are enacted finally on the same
date, the statute bearing the highest number, in either case
irrespective of its effective date, shall prevail from the time
it becomes effective except as otherwise provided in section
1952 of this title (relating to effect of separate amendments
on code provisions enacted by same General Assembly) and section
1974 of this title (relating to effect of separate repeals on
code provisions by same General Assembly).
Cross References. Section 1935 is referred to in section
1955 of this title.
§ 1936. Irreconcilable statutes passed by different General
Assemblies.
Whenever the provisions of two or more statutes enacted
finally by different General Assemblies are irreconcilable, the
statute latest in date of final enactment shall prevail.
Cross References. Section 1936 is referred to in section
1955 of this title.
§ 1937. References to statutes and regulations.
(a) General rule.--A reference in a statute to a statute
or to a regulation issued by a public body or public officer
includes the statute or regulation with all amendments and
supplements thereto and any new statute or regulation
substituted for such statute or regulation, as in force at the
time of application of the provision of the statute in which
such reference is made, unless the specific language or the
context of the reference in the provision clearly includes only
the statute or regulation as in force on the effective date of
the statute in which such reference is made.
(b) Applicability of section.--The provisions of subsection
(a) of this section shall apply to every statute finally enacted
on or after July 1, 1971.
§ 1938. References to public bodies and public officers.
A reference in a statute to a governmental agency,
department, board, commission or other public body or to a
public officer includes an entity or officer which succeeds to
substantially the same functions as those performed by such
public body or officer on the effective date of the statute,
unless the specific language or the context of the reference
in the statute clearly includes only the public body or officer
on the effective date of the statute.
§ 1939. Use of comments and reports.
The comments or report of the commission, committee,
association or other entity which drafted a statute may be
consulted in the construction or application of the original
provisions of the statute if such comments or report were
published or otherwise generally available prior to the
consideration of the statute by the General Assembly, but the
text of the statute shall control in the event of conflict
between its text and such comments or report.
SUBCHAPTER C
AMENDATORY STATUTES
Sec.
1951. Interpretation of amendatory statutes.
1952. Effect of separate amendments on code provisions enacted
by same General Assembly.
1953. Construction of amendatory statutes.
1954. Merger of subsequent amendments.
1955. Two or more amendments to same provision, one overlooking
the other.
1956. Repeal of amendatory statutes and original statutes
subsequently amended.
1957. Ineffective provisions not revived by reenactment in
amendatory statutes.
§ 1951. Interpretation of amendatory statutes.
In ascertaining the correct reading, status and
interpretation of an amendatory statute, the matter inserted
within brackets shall be omitted, and the matter in italics or
underscored shall be read and interpreted as part of the
statute.
§ 1952. Effect of separate amendments on code provisions
enacted by same General Assembly.
Whenever any existing statute, incorporated into and repealed
by a code, is also amended by other legislation enacted by the
same General Assembly, such separate amendment shall be
construed to be in force, notwithstanding the repeal by the
code of the statute such other legislation amends, and such
amendment shall be construed to prevail over the corresponding
provisions of the code.
Applicability. Section 1952 was made inapplicable, in whole
or in part, by various statutes amending the Pennsylvania
Consolidated Statutes and amending or repealing corresponding
former provisions of law. In such cases, the appendix following
the particular title affected contains the provision of the
statute which rendered section 1952 inapplicable.
Cross References. Section 1952 is referred to in sections
1935, 1956 of this title.
§ 1953. Construction of amendatory statutes.
Whenever a section or part of a statute is amended, the
amendment shall be construed as merging into the original
statute, become a part thereof, and replace the part amended,
and the remainder of the original statute and the amendment
shall be read together and viewed as one statute passed at one
time; but the portions of the statute which were not altered
by the amendment shall be construed as effective from the time
of their original enactment, and the new provisions shall be
construed as effective only from the date when the amendment
became effective.
§ 1954. Merger of subsequent amendments.
Whenever a statute has been more than once amended, the
latest amendment shall be read into the original statute as
previously amended and not into such statute as originally
enacted. This rule applies whether or not the previous amendment
is referred to and whether or not its language is incorporated
in the latest amendment. If the insertions in and the deletions
from the statute made by the previous amendment are not
incorporated in the later, they shall nevertheless be read into
the later amendment as though they had in fact been incorporated
therein.
§ 1955. Two or more amendments to same provision, one
overlooking the other.
Whenever two or more amendments to the same provision of a
statute are enacted at the same or different sessions, one
amendment overlooking and making no reference to the other or
others, the changes in the statute made by each shall be given
effect and all the amendments shall be read into each other.
If the changes made in the statute are to any extent in direct
conflict with each other, the rules specified in section 1935
of this title (relating to irreconcilable statutes passed by
same General Assembly) and section 1936 of this title (relating
to irreconcilable statutes passed by different General
Assemblies) shall govern. The fact that a later amendment (1)
restates language of the original statute which was deleted by
an earlier amendment, or (2) fails to restate language inserted
by an earlier amendment, does not of itself create a conflict
between the two amendments. Amendments are in conflict with
each other only if the changes in the statute made by each
without considering the inserts and strike-outs of the other
cannot be put into operation simultaneously.
§ 1956. Repeal of amendatory statutes and original statutes
subsequently amended.
The repeal of an amendatory statute does not revive the
corresponding provision or section of the original statute or
of any prior amendment. Except as otherwise provided in section
1952 of this title (relating to effect of separate amendments
on code provisions enacted by same General Assembly), the repeal
of an original statute, or section or provision of an original
statute, repeals all subsequent amendments to the original
statute, or to the original section or provision, as the case
may be.
§ 1957. Ineffective provisions not revived by reenactment in
amendatory statutes.
Provisions of a statute no longer effective because of having
been deleted by an earlier amendment or otherwise shall not be
construed as being revived by reenactment in an amendatory
statute, unless it shall clearly appear by notice thereof in
the title of the amendatory statute that the General Assembly
intended to revive such provisions.
SUBCHAPTER D
REENACTMENTS
Sec.
1961. Effect of reenactment on original statute.
1962. Repeal and reenactment.
1963. Effect of reenactment on intervening statutes.
§ 1961. Effect of reenactment on original statute.
Whenever a statute reenacts a former statute, the provisions
common to both statutes shall date from their first adoption.
Such provisions only of the former statute as are omitted from
the reenactment shall be deemed abrogated, and only the new or
changed provisions shall be deemed to be the law from the
effective date of the reenactment.
§ 1962. Repeal and reenactment.
Whenever a statute is repealed and its provisions are at the
same time reenacted in the same or substantially the same terms
by the repealing statute, the earlier statute shall be construed
as continued in active operation. All rights and liabilities
incurred under such earlier statute are preserved and may be
enforced.
§ 1963. Effect of reenactment on intervening statutes.
A statute which reenacts the provisions of an earlier statute
shall not be construed to repeal an intermediate statute which
modified but did not effect an amendment to such earlier
statute. Such intermediate statute shall be construed to remain
in force and to modify the reenactment in the same manner as
it modified the earlier statute.
SUBCHAPTER E
REPEALING STATUTES
Sec.
1971. Implied repeal by later statute.
1972. Nonexistence of reason for statute does not effect

1977. Repeal does not revive repealed statute.
1978. Repeal as obsolete does not affect substantive rights.
§ 1971. Implied repeal by later statute.
(a) Revision or exclusive system covering entire
subject.--Whenever a statute purports to be a revision of all
statutes upon a particular subject, or sets up a general or
exclusive system covering the entire subject matter of a former
statute and is intended as a substitute for such former statute,
such statute shall be construed to supply and therefore to
repeal all former statutes upon the same subject.
(b) Uniform mandatory system covering class of
subjects.--Whenever a general statute purports to establish a
uniform and mandatory system covering a class of subjects, such
statute shall be construed to supply and therefore to repeal
pre-existing local or special statutes on the same class of
subjects.
(c) Other cases.--In all other cases, a later statute shall
not be construed to supply or repeal an earlier statute unless
the two statutes are irreconcilable.
§ 1972. Nonexistence of reason for statute does not effect
repeal.
A statute shall not be deemed repealed because the reason
for its passage no longer exists.
§ 1973. No implied repeal by nonuser.
A statute shall not be deemed repealed by failure to use
such statute.
§ 1974. Effect of separate repeals on code provisions by same
General Assembly.
Whenever a statute repeals any provision of another statute
incorporated into a code adopted by the same General Assembly,
the statute repealing the provision so incorporated into the
code shall be construed to effect a repeal of the corresponding
provision of the code.
Applicability. Section 1974 was made inapplicable, in whole
or in part, by various statutes amending the Pennsylvania
Consolidated Statutes and amending or repealing corresponding
former provisions of law. In such cases, the appendix following
the particular title affected contains the provision of the
statute which rendered section 1974 inapplicable.
Cross References. Section 1974 is referred to in section
1935 of this title.
§ 1975. Effect of repeal on limitations.
Whenever a limitation or period of time, prescribed in any
statute for acquiring a right or barring a remedy, or for any
other purpose, has begun to run before a statute repealing such
statute takes effect, and the same or any other limitation is
prescribed in any other statute passed by the same General
Assembly, the time which has already run shall be deemed part
of the time prescribed as such limitation in such statute passed
by the same General Assembly.
§ 1976. Effect of repeal on rights, et cetera.
(a) Existing rights and pending actions.--The repeal of any
civil provisions of a statute shall not affect or impair any
act done, or right existing or accrued, or affect any civil
action pending to enforce any right under the authority of the
statute repealed. Such action may be proceeded with and
concluded under the statutes in existence when such action was
instituted, notwithstanding the repeal of such statutes, or
such action may be proceeded with and concluded under the
provisions of the new statute, if any, enacted.
(b) Existence of private corporation.--The repeal of any
statute shall not affect the corporate existence of any private
corporation created by or incorporated under such statute.
§ 1977. Repeal does not revive repealed statute.
The repeal of a repealing statute shall not be construed to
revive the statute originally repealed.
§ 1978. Repeal as obsolete does not affect substantive rights.
Whenever a statute which created a personal or property right
in derogation of the common law is repealed as obsolete or by
a code which does not contain an express provision with respect
to such personal or property right, the repeal shall not be
construed to revive the prior inconsistent common law rule, but
such repeal shall be construed as a recognition by the General
Assembly that such personal or property right has been received
into and has become a part of the common law of this
Commonwealth.

as husband and wife, and the subsequent marriage was entered
into by one or both of the parties in good faith in the full
belief that the former spouse was dead or that the former
marriage has been annulled or terminated by a divorce, or
without knowledge of the former marriage, they shall, after the
impediment to their marriage has been removed by the death of
the other party to the former marriage or by annulment or
divorce, if they continue to live together as husband and wife
in good faith on the part of one of them, be held to have been
legally married from and immediately after the date of death
or the date of the decree of annulment or divorce.
(b) False rumor of death of spouse.--Where a remarriage has
occurred upon false rumor of the death of a former spouse in
appearance well-founded but there has been no decree of presumed
death, the remarriage shall be void and subject to annulment
by either party to the remarriage as provided by section 3304
(relating to grounds for annulment of void marriages), and the
returning spouse shall have cause for divorce as provided in
section 3301 (relating to grounds for divorce).

rape or incest.
Cross References. Subchapter B is referred to in section
2504.1 of this title; section 6351 of Title 42 (Judiciary and
Judicial Procedure).
§ 2511. Grounds for involuntary termination.
(a) General rule.--The rights of a parent in regard to a
child may be terminated after a petition filed on any of the
following grounds:
(1) The parent by conduct continuing for a period of
at least six months immediately preceding the filing of the
petition either has evidenced a settled purpose of
relinquishing parental claim to a child or has refused or
failed to perform parental duties.
(2) The repeated and continued incapacity, abuse,
neglect or refusal of the parent has caused the child to be
without essential parental care, control or subsistence
necessary for his physical or mental well-being and the
conditions and causes of the incapacity, abuse, neglect or
refusal cannot or will not be remedied by the parent.
(3) The parent is the presumptive but not the natural
father of the child.
(4) The child is in the custody of an agency, having
been found under such circumstances that the identity or
whereabouts of the parent is unknown and cannot be
ascertained by diligent search and the parent does not claim
the child within three months after the child is found.
(5) The child has been removed from the care of the
parent by the court or under a voluntary agreement with an
agency for a period of at least six months, the conditions
which led to the removal or placement of the child continue
to exist, the parent cannot or will not remedy those
conditions within a reasonable period of time, the services
or assistance reasonably available to the parent are not
likely to remedy the conditions which led to the removal or
placement of the child within a reasonable period of time
and termination of the parental rights would best serve the
needs and welfare of the child.
(6) In the case of a newborn child, the parent knows
or has reason to know of the child's birth, does not reside
with the child, has not married the child's other parent,
has failed for a period of four months immediately preceding
the filing of the petition to make reasonable efforts to
maintain substantial and continuing contact with the child
and has failed during the same four-month period to provide
substantial financial support for the child.
(7) The parent is the father of a child conceived as a
result of a rape or incest.
(8) The child has been removed from the care of the
parent by the court or under a voluntary agreement with an
agency, 12 months or more have elapsed from the date of
removal or placement, the conditions which led to the removal
or placement of the child continue to exist and termination
of parental rights would best serve the needs and welfare
of the child.
(9) The parent has been convicted of one of the
following in which the victim was a child of the parent:
(i) an offense under 18 Pa.C.S. Ch. 25 (relating
to criminal homicide);
(ii) a felony under 18 Pa.C.S. § 2702 (relating to
aggravated assault);
(iii) an offense in another jurisdiction equivalent
to an offense in subparagraph (i) or (ii); or
(iv) an attempt, solicitation or conspiracy to
commit an offense in subparagraph (i), (ii) or (iii).
(10) The parent has been found by a court of competent
jurisdiction to have committed sexual abuse against the child
or another child of the parent based on a judicial
adjudication as set forth in paragraph (1)(i), (ii), (iii)
or (iv) or (4) of the definition of "founded report" in
section 6303(a) (relating to definitions) where the judicial
adjudication is based on a finding of "sexual abuse or
exploitation" as defined in section 6303(a).
(11) The parent is required to register as a sexual
offender under 42 Pa.C.S. Ch. 97 Subch. H (relating to
registration of sexual offenders) or I (relating to continued
registration of sexual offenders) or to register with a
sexual offender registry in another jurisdiction or foreign
country.
(b) Other considerations.--The court in terminating the
rights of a parent shall give primary consideration to the
developmental, physical and emotional needs and welfare of the
child. The rights of a parent shall not be terminated solely
on the basis of environmental factors such as inadequate
housing, furnishings, income, clothing and medical care if found
to be beyond the control of the parent. With respect to any
petition filed pursuant to subsection (a)(1), (6) or (8), the
court shall not consider any efforts by the parent to remedy
the conditions described therein which are first initiated
subsequent to the giving of notice of the filing of the
petition.
(c) Right to file personal and medical history
information.--At the time the decree of termination is
transmitted to the parent whose rights have been terminated,
the court shall advise the parent, in writing, of his or her
continuing right to place and update personal and medical
history information, whether or not the medical condition is
in existence or discoverable at the time of adoption, on file
with the court and with the Department of Public Welfare
pursuant to Subchapter B of Chapter 29 (relating to records and
access to information).

prospective adoptive parent or parents would not receive a
favorable recommendation for placement as a result of the
home study.
(2) The individual or agency conducting the home study

with an agency until a favorable recommendation for placement
is received.

agreement.

enforcement or damages in connection with an agreement.

disintegration and cooperate with and utilize the resources

from a spouse upon the ground that insanity or serious mental

prospect that the spouse will be discharged from inpatient care
during the 18 months subsequent to the commencement of the
action. A presumption that no prospect of discharge exists shall
be established by a certificate of the superintendent of the
institution to that effect and which includes a supporting
statement of a treating physician.
(c) Mutual consent.--
(1) The court may grant a divorce where it is alleged
that the marriage is irretrievably broken and 90 days have
elapsed from the date of commencement of an action under
this part and an affidavit has been filed by each of the
parties evidencing that each of the parties consents to the
divorce.

party has been convicted of committing a personal injury
crime against the other party.

year and that the marriage is irretrievably broken and the
defendant either:
(i) Does not deny the allegations set forth in the
affidavit.
(ii) Denies one or more of the allegations set forth
in the affidavit but, after notice and hearing, the court
determines that the parties have lived separate and apart
for a period of at least one year and that the marriage
is irretrievably broken.
(2) If a hearing has been held pursuant to paragraph
(1)(ii) and the court determines that there is a reasonable
prospect of reconciliation, then the court shall continue
the matter for a period not less than 90 days nor more than
120 days unless the parties agree to a period in excess of
120 days. During this period, the court shall require
counseling as provided in section 3302 (relating to
counseling). If the parties have not reconciled at the
expiration of the time period and one party states under

broken, the court shall grant the divorce. Otherwise, the
court shall deny the divorce.
(e) No hearing required in certain cases.--If grounds for
divorce alleged in the complaint or counterclaim are established
under subsection (c) or (d), the court shall grant a divorce
without requiring a hearing on any other grounds.

hearing officers in partial custody or visitation matters.
§ 3322. Jury trial.
(a) Application for jury trial.--After service of the
complaint in divorce or annulment on the defendant in the manner
prescribed by general rules or entry of a general appearance
for the defendant, if either of the parties desires any matter
of fact that is affirmed by one and denied by the other to be
tried by a jury, that party may take a rule upon the opposite
party, to be allowed by a judge of the court, to show cause why
the issues of fact set forth in the rule should not be tried
by a jury, which rule shall be served upon the opposite party
or counsel for the opposite party.
(b) Disposition of application.--Upon the return of the
rule, after hearing, the court may discharge it, make it

matters are raised in any pleadings, an order determining and
disposing of existing property rights and interests between the
parties, custody, partial custody and visitation rights, child
support, alimony, reasonable attorney fees, costs and expenses
and any other related matters, including the enforcement of
agreements voluntarily entered into between the parties and

change the beneficiary status on an existing life insurance
policy, annuity contract, pension, profit-sharing plan or other

parties that failure to do so may result in revocation of the
beneficiary designation pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. § 6111.2

of beneficiaries). The provision shall be a form as may be
prescribed by general rule.
(c) Bifurcation.--(Deleted by amendment).

court may enter a decree of divorce or annulment prior to the
final determination and disposition of the matters provided for

sufficient economic protections for any minor children of the
marriage. In the absence of the consent of both parties, the

subsection (g); and
(2) the moving party has demonstrated that:
(i) compelling circumstances exist for the entry

to the final determination in such proceeding of the property
rights and interests of the parties under this part, the
personal representative of the deceased party shall be
substituted as a party as provided by law and the action shall
proceed.
(d.1) Death of a party.--In the event one party dies during
the course of divorce proceedings, no decree of divorce has
been entered and grounds have been established as provided in
subsection (g), the parties' economic rights and obligations
arising under the marriage shall be determined under this part
rather than under 20 Pa.C.S. (relating to decedents, estates
and fiduciaries).
(e) Costs.--The court may award costs to the party in whose
favor the order or decree shall be entered or may order that
each party shall pay their own costs or may order that costs
be divided equitably as it shall appear just and reasonable.
(f) Equity power and jurisdiction of the court.--In all
matrimonial causes, the court shall have full equity power and
jurisdiction and may issue injunctions or other orders which
are necessary to protect the interests of the parties or to
effectuate the purposes of this part and may grant such other
relief or remedy as equity and justice require against either

§ 3331. Limitations on attacks upon decrees.
The validity of a decree of divorce or annulment issued by
a court shall not be questioned, except by appeal, in any court
or place in this Commonwealth after the death of either party
to the proceeding. If it is shown that a party who subsequently
attempts to question the validity of the decree had full
knowledge of the facts and circumstances later complained of
at the time of issuance of the decree or failed to take any
action despite this knowledge within two years after the date
of the decree, the party shall be barred from questioning the
decree, and it shall be valid in all courts and places within
this Commonwealth.
§ 3332. Opening or vacating decrees.
A motion to open a decree of divorce or annulment may be
made only within the period limited by 42 Pa.C.S. § 5505
(relating to modification of orders) and not thereafter. The
motion may lie where it is alleged that the decree was procured
by intrinsic fraud or that there is new evidence relating to
the cause of action which will sustain the attack upon its
validity. A motion to vacate a decree or strike a judgment
alleged to be void because of extrinsic fraud, lack of
jurisdiction over the subject matter or a fatal defect apparent
upon the face of the record must be made within five years after
entry of the final decree. Intrinsic fraud relates to a matter
adjudicated by the judgment, including perjury and false
testimony, whereas extrinsic fraud relates to matters collateral
to the judgment which have the consequence of precluding a fair
hearing or presentation of one side of the case.
§ 3333. Res judicata and estoppel.
The validity of a divorce or annulment decree granted by a
court having jurisdiction over the subject matter may not be
questioned by a party who was subject to the personal
jurisdiction of the court except by direct appeal provided or
prescribed by law. A party who sought and obtained a decree,
financed or agreed to its procurement, or accepted a property
settlement, alimony pendente lite or alimony pursuant to the
terms of the decree, or who remarries after the decree, or is
guilty of laches, is barred from making a collateral attack
upon the validity of the decree unless, by clear and convincing
evidence, it is established that fraud by the other party
prevented the making of a timely appeal from the divorce or
annulment decree.

of this title.
§ 3501. Definitions.
(a) General rule.--As used in this chapter, "marital
property" means all property acquired by either party during
the marriage and the increase in value of any nonmarital
property acquired pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (3) as measured
and determined under subsection (a.1). However, marital property
does not include:
(1) Property acquired prior to marriage or property
acquired in exchange for property acquired prior to the
marriage.
(2) Property excluded by valid agreement of the parties
entered into before, during or after the marriage.
(3) Property acquired by gift, except between spouses,
bequest, devise or descent or property acquired in exchange
for such property.
(4) Property acquired after final separation until the
date of divorce, except for property acquired in exchange
for marital assets.
(5) Property which a party has sold, granted, conveyed
or otherwise disposed of in good faith and for value prior
to the date of final separation.
(6) Veterans' benefits exempt from attachment, levy or
seizure pursuant to the act of September 2, 1958 (Public Law
85-857, 72 Stat. 1229), as amended, except for those benefits
received by a veteran where the veteran has waived a portion
of his military retirement pay in order to receive veterans'
compensation.
(7) Property to the extent to which the property has
been mortgaged or otherwise encumbered in good faith for
value prior to the date of final separation.
(8) Any payment received as a result of an award or
settlement for any cause of action or claim which accrued
prior to the marriage or after the date of final separation
regardless of when the payment was received.
(a.1) Measuring and determining the increase in value of
nonmarital property.--The increase in value of any nonmarital
property acquired pursuant to subsection (a)(1) and (3) shall
be measured from the date of marriage or later acquisition date
to either the date of final separation or the date as close to
the hearing on equitable distribution as possible, whichever
date results in a lesser increase. Any decrease in value of the
nonmarital property of a party shall be offset against any
increase in value of the nonmarital property of that party.
However, a decrease in value of the nonmarital property of a
party shall not be offset against any increase in value of the
nonmarital property of the other party or against any other
marital property subject to equitable division.
(b) Presumption.--All real or personal property acquired
by either party during the marriage is presumed to be marital
property regardless of whether title is held individually or
by the parties in some form of co-ownership such as joint
tenancy, tenancy in common or tenancy by the entirety. The
presumption of marital property is overcome by a showing that
the property was acquired by a method listed in subsection (a).
(c) Defined benefit retirement plans.--Notwithstanding
subsections (a), (a.1) and (b):
(1) In the case of the marital portion of a defined
benefit retirement plan being distributed by means of a
deferred distribution, the defined benefit plan shall be
allocated between its marital and nonmarital portions solely
by use of a coverture fraction. The denominator of the
coverture fraction shall be the number of months the employee
spouse worked to earn the total benefit and the numerator
shall be the number of such months during which the parties
were married and not finally separated. The benefit to which
the coverture fraction is applied shall include all
postseparation enhancements except for enhancements arising
from postseparation monetary contributions made by the
employee spouse, including the gain or loss on such
contributions.
(2) In the case of the marital portion of a defined
benefit retirement plan being distributed by means of an
immediate offset, the defined benefit plan shall be allocated
between its marital and nonmarital portions solely by use
of a coverture fraction. The denominator of the coverture
fraction shall be the number of months the employee spouse
worked to earn the accrued benefit as of a date as close to
the time of trial as reasonably possible and the numerator
shall be the number of such months during which the parties
were married and not finally separated. The benefit to which
the coverture fraction is applied shall include all
postseparation enhancements up to a date as close to the
time of trial as reasonably possible except for enhancements
arising from postseparation monetary contributions made by
the employee spouse, including the gain or loss on such
contributions.

§ 3502. Equitable division of marital property.
(a) General rule.--Upon the request of either party in an
action for divorce or annulment, the court shall equitably
divide, distribute or assign, in kind or otherwise, the marital
property between the parties without regard to marital
misconduct in such percentages and in such manner as the court
deems just after considering all relevant factors. The court
may consider each marital asset or group of assets independently
and apply a different percentage to each marital asset or group
of assets. Factors which are relevant to the equitable division
of marital property include the following:
(1) The length of the marriage.
(2) Any prior marriage of either party.
(3) The age, health, station, amount and sources of
income, vocational skills, employability, estate, liabilities
and needs of each of the parties.
(4) The contribution by one party to the education,
training or increased earning power of the other party.
(5) The opportunity of each party for future
acquisitions of capital assets and income.
(6) The sources of income of both parties, including,
but not limited to, medical, retirement, insurance or other
benefits.
(7) The contribution or dissipation of each party in
the acquisition, preservation, depreciation or appreciation
of the marital property, including the contribution of a
party as homemaker.
(8) The value of the property set apart to each party.
(9) The standard of living of the parties established
during the marriage.
(10) The economic circumstances of each party at the
time the division of property is to become effective.
(10.1) The Federal, State and local tax ramifications
associated with each asset to be divided, distributed or
assigned, which ramifications need not be immediate and
certain.
(10.2) The expense of sale, transfer or liquidation
associated with a particular asset, which expense need not
be immediate and certain.
(11) Whether the party will be serving as the custodian
of any dependent minor children.
(b) Lien.--The court may impose a lien or charge upon
property of a party as security for the payment of alimony or
any other award for the other party.
(c) Family home.--The court may award, during the pendency
of the action or otherwise, to one or both of the parties the
right to reside in the marital residence.
(d) Life insurance.--The court may direct the continued
maintenance and beneficiary designations of existing policies
insuring the life or health of either party which were
originally purchased during the marriage and owned by or within
the effective control of either party. Where it is necessary
to protect the interests of a party, the court may also direct
the purchase of, and beneficiary designations on, a policy
insuring the life or health of either party.
(e) Powers of the court.--If, at any time, a party has
failed to comply with an order of equitable distribution, as
provided for in this chapter or with the terms of an agreement
as entered into between the parties, after hearing, the court
may, in addition to any other remedy available under this part,
in order to effect compliance with its order:
(1) enter judgment;
(2) authorize the taking and seizure of the goods and
chattels and collection of the rents and profits of the real
and personal, tangible and intangible property of the party;
(3) award interest on unpaid installments;
(4) order and direct the transfer or sale of any
property required in order to comply with the court's order;
(5) require security to insure future payments in
compliance with the court's order;
(6) issue attachment proceedings, directed to the
sheriff or other proper officer of the county, directing
that the person named as having failed to comply with the
court order be brought before the court, at such time as the
court may direct. If the court finds, after hearing, that
the person willfully failed to comply with the court order,
it may deem the person in civil contempt of court and, in
its discretion, make an appropriate order, including, but
not limited to, commitment of the person to the county jail
for a period not to exceed six months;
(7) award counsel fees and costs;
(8) attach wages; or
(9) find the party in contempt.
(f) Partial distribution.--The court, upon the request of
either party, may at any stage of the proceedings enter an order
providing for an interim partial distribution or assignment of
marital property.

§ 3503. Effect of divorce on property rights generally.
Whenever a decree or judgment is granted which nullifies or
absolutely terminates the bonds of matrimony, all property
rights which are dependent upon the marital relation, except
those which are vested rights, are terminated unless the court
expressly provides otherwise in its decree. All duties, rights
and claims accruing to either of the parties at any time
theretofore in pursuance of the marriage shall cease, and the
parties shall severally be at liberty to marry again as if they
had never been married.
§ 3504. Disposition of property after termination of marriage.
Unless provided otherwise by the court, whenever a decree
of divorce or annulment is entered by a court of competent
jurisdiction, both parties whose marriage is terminated or
affected shall have complete freedom of disposition as to their
separate real and personal property and may mortgage, sell,
grant, convey or otherwise encumber or dispose of their separate
property, whether the property was acquired before, during or
after coverture, and neither need join in, consent to or
acknowledge a deed, mortgage or instrument of the other.
§ 3505. Disposition of property to defeat obligations.
(a) Preliminary relief.--Where it appears to the court that
a party is about to leave the jurisdiction of the court or is
about to remove property of that party from the jurisdiction
of the court or is about to dispose of, alienate or encumber
property in order to defeat equitable distribution, alimony
pendente lite, alimony, child and spousal support or a similar
award, an injunction may issue to prevent the removal or
disposition and the property may be attached as prescribed by
general rules. The court may also issue a writ of ne exeat to
preclude the removal.
(b) Inventory of property.--Both parties shall submit to
the court an inventory and appraisement, which shall contain
all of the following:
(1) A list of the property owned or possessed by either
or both of them as of:

provided for all other civil actions under the Pennsylvania
Rules of Civil Procedure.

alimony or alimony pendente lite, or the property of that person
is found within this Commonwealth, the obligee of the decree
may petition the court where the obligor or the property of the
obligor is found to register, adopt as its own and enforce the
decree as a properly issued and authenticated decree of a sister
state or territory. Upon registration and adoption, such relief
and process for enforcement as is provided or prescribed by law
in similar cases originally commenced in this Commonwealth shall
be available. A copy of the decree and order shall be forwarded
to the court of the state or territory which issued the original
decree. The obligor shall have whatever defenses and relief are
available to the obligor in the state or territory which issued
the original decree and may question the jurisdiction of that
court if not otherwise barred. Interest may be awarded on unpaid
installments and security may be required to insure future
payments as in cases originally commenced in this Commonwealth.
Where property of the obligor, but not the person of the
obligor, is found within this Commonwealth, there shall be
jurisdiction quasi in rem, and, upon registration and adoption
of the decree of the sister state or territory, relief and
enforcement of the decree shall be available as in other
proceedings which are quasi in rem.

and a child has been conceived as a result of the offense:
(i) 18 Pa.C.S. § 3121 (relating to rape);

based upon the reasonable needs of the child or spouse seeking
support and the ability of the obligor to provide support. In
determining the reasonable needs of the child or spouse seeking
support and the ability of the obligor to provide support, the
guideline shall place primary emphasis on the net incomes and
earning capacities of the parties, with allowable deviations
for unusual needs, extraordinary expenses and other factors,
such as the parties' assets, as warrant special attention. The
guideline so developed shall be reviewed at least once every
four years.
(b) Rebuttable presumption.--There shall be a rebuttable
presumption, in any judicial or expedited process, that the
amount of the award which would result from the application of
such guideline is the correct amount of support to be awarded.
A written finding or specific finding on the record that the
application of the guideline would be unjust or inappropriate
in a particular case shall be sufficient to rebut the
presumption in that case, provided that the finding is based
upon criteria established by the Supreme Court by general rule
within one year of the effective date of this act.

require that an obligor pay a designated percentage of a
spouse's reasonable and necessary health care expenses. If
health care coverage is available through an obligor or obligee
at no cost as a benefit of employment or at a reasonable cost,

(a) General rule.--In every proceeding to establish or
modify an order which requires the payment of child support,

medical support for the children of the parties, and the order
shall include a requirement for medical support to be provided
by either or both parents, provided that such medical support
is accessible to the children.

available, the court shall require one or both parents to
provide medical support.

available at a reasonable cost to a custodial parent, the court
shall require that the custodial parent provide such medical
support to the children of the parties, unless adequate medical
support has already been provided through the noncustodial
parent. In cases where the parents have shared custody of the

require one or both parents to provide medical support, taking
into account the financial ability of the parties and the extent
of medical support available to each parent.

the court shall order either parent or both parents to obtain
medical support for the parties' children which is available

a medical support notice for use by the department or domestic
relations section in accordance with procedures established by
the department. The medical support notice shall comply with

who is a new hire into the Commonwealth directory of new hires
under section 4392 (relating to employer reporting).
(e) Uninsured expenses.--The court shall determine the
amount of any deductible and copayments which each parent shall
pay. In addition, the court may require that either parent or
both parents pay a designated percentage of the reasonable and
necessary uncovered health care expenses of the parties'
children, including birth-related expenses incurred prior to
the filing of the complaint. Upon request of the domestic
relations section, the department shall provide to the domestic
relations section all birth-related expenses which the
department has incurred in cases it has referred to the domestic
relations section for child support services.
(f) Proof of insurance.--Within 30 days after the entry of
an order requiring a parent to provide health care coverage for
a child or after any change in health care coverage due to a

Assistance patients, to the department;
(2) to provide such information to the custodial parent
as may be necessary to obtain benefits, including copies of
benefit booklets, insurance contracts and claims information;
(3) if coverage is made available for dependents of the
insured, to make such coverage available to the insured's
children without regard to enrollment season restrictions,
whether the child was born out of wedlock, whether the child
is claimed as a dependent on the parent's Federal income tax
return, whether the child resides in the insurer's service
area, the amount of support contributed by a parent, the
amount of time the child spends in the home or the custodial
arrangements for the child;
(4) to permit the enrollment of children under court
order upon application of the custodial parent, domestic
relations section or the department within 30 days of receipt
by the insurer of the order;
(4.1) not to disenroll or eliminate coverage of any
child unless the insurer is provided satisfactory written
evidence that a court order requiring coverage is no longer
in effect or that the child is or will be enrolled in
comparable health coverage through another insurer which
will take effect no later than the effective date of such
disenrollment;
(4.2) to receive, process and pay claims (whether or
not on behalf of a child), including electronically submitted
claims, submitted by the department within the time permitted
by law without imposing any patient signature requirement
or other requirement different from those imposed upon
providers, agents or assignees of any insured individual;
(5) to provide the custodial parent who has complied
with subsection (j) with the same notification of termination
or modification of any health care coverage due to nonpayment
of premiums or other reason as is provided to other insureds
under the policy; and
(6) except as provided in paragraph (4.2), to not take
into account the fact that any individual, whether or not a
child, is eligible for or is being provided medical
assistance when enrolling that individual or when making any
payments for benefits to the individual or on the
individual's behalf.
(h) Obligations of noninsurers.--To the maximum extent
permitted by Federal law, the obligations of subsection (g)
shall apply to noninsurers providing health care coverage within
this Commonwealth, including health maintenance organizations,
self-insured employee health benefit plans and any other entity
offering a service benefit plan.
(h.1) Obligations of employers.--Every employer doing
business within this Commonwealth shall be obligated as follows:
(1) in any case in which a parent is required by a court
order to provide health coverage for a child and the parent
is eligible for family health coverage, the employer shall
permit the insured parent to enroll any child who is
otherwise eligible without regard to any enrollment season
restrictions;
(2) if the insured parent is enrolled but fails to make
application to obtain coverage for such child, to enroll the
child under the family coverage upon application by the
child's other parent, the domestic relations section or the
department;

insurer to communicate directly with the custodial parent.

of premiums for health coverage shall be deducted by the
employer and paid to the insurer or other entity providing

with the order to provide health care coverage for a child,
fails to pay medical expenses for a child or receives payment
from a third party for the cost of medical services provided
to such child and fails to reimburse the custodial parent or
provider of services, the court shall:
(1) If, after a hearing, the failure or refusal is
determined to have been willful, impose the penalties of
section 4345(a) (relating to contempt for noncompliance with
support order).
(2) Enter an order for a sum certain against the
obligated parent for the cost of medical care for the child
and for any premiums paid or provided for the child during
any period in which the obligated parent failed or refused
to provide coverage. Failure to comply with an order under
this paragraph shall be subject to section 4348 (relating
to attachment of income).
(3) Upon failure of the obligated parent to make this
payment or reimburse the custodial parent and after
compliance with due process requirements, treat the amount
as arrearages.
(k) Enforcement against insurers.--Any insurer or other

(a) General rule.--Where applicable under this section, a
court may order either or both parents who are separated,
divorced, unmarried or otherwise subject to an existing support
obligation to provide equitably for educational costs of their
child whether an application for this support is made before
or after the child has reached 18 years of age. The
responsibility to provide for postsecondary educational expenses
is a shared responsibility between both parents. The duty of a
parent to provide a postsecondary education for a child is not
as exacting a requirement as the duty to provide food, clothing
and shelter for a child of tender years unable to support
himself. This authority shall extend to postsecondary education,
including periods of undergraduate or vocational education after
the child graduates from high school. An award for postsecondary
educational costs may be entered only after the child or student
has made reasonable efforts to apply for scholarships, grants
and work-study assistance.
(b) Action to recover educational expenses.--An action to
recover educational costs may be commenced:
(1) by the student if over 18 years of age; or
(2) by either parent on behalf of a child under 18 years
of age, but, if the student is over 18 years of age, the
student's written consent to the action must be secured.
(c) Calculation of educational costs.--In making an award
under this section, the court shall calculate educational costs
as defined in this section.
(d) Grants and scholarships.--The court shall deduct from
the educational costs all grants and scholarships awarded to
the student.
(e) Other relevant factors.--After calculating educational
costs and deducting grants and scholarships, the court may order
either parent or both parents to pay all or part of the
remaining educational costs of their child. The court shall
consider all relevant factors which appear reasonable, equitable
and necessary, including the following:
(1) The financial resources of both parents.
(2) The financial resources of the student.
(3) The receipt of educational loans and other financial
assistance by the student.
(4) The ability, willingness and desire of the student
to pursue and complete the course of study.
(5) Any willful estrangement between parent and student
caused by the student after attaining majority.
(6) The ability of the student to contribute to the
student's expenses through gainful employment. The student's
history of employment is material under this paragraph.
(7) Any other relevant factors.
(f) When liability may not be found.--A court shall not
order support for educational costs if any of the following
circumstances exist:
(1) Undue financial hardship would result to the parent.
(2) The educational costs would be a contribution for
postcollege graduate educational costs.
(3) The order would extend support for the student
beyond the student's twenty-third birthday. If exceptional
circumstances exist, the court may order educational support
for the student beyond the student's twenty-third birthday.
(g) Parent's obligation.--A parent's obligation to
contribute toward the educational costs of a student shall not
include payments to the other parent for the student's living
expenses at home unless the student resides at home with the
other parent and commutes to school.
(h) Termination or modification of orders.--Any party may
request modification or termination of an order entered under
this section upon proof of change in educational status of the
student, a material change in the financial status of any party
or other relevant factors.
(i) Applicability.--
(1) This act shall apply to all divorce decrees, support
agreements, support orders, agreed or stipulated court
orders, property settlement agreements, equitable
distribution agreements, custody agreements and/or court
orders and agreed to or stipulated court orders in effect
on, executed or entered since, November 12, 1992.
(2) In addition, this act shall apply to all pending
actions for support. This section shall not supersede or
modify the express terms of a voluntary written marital
settlement agreement or any court order entered pursuant
thereto.
(j) Definitions.--As used in this section, the following
words and phrases shall have the meanings given to them in this
subsection:
"Educational costs." Tuition, fees, books, room, board and
other educational materials.
"Postsecondary education." An educational or vocational
program provided at a college, university or other postsecondary
vocational, secretarial, business or technical school.

§ 4343. Paternity.
(a) Determination.--Where the paternity of a child born out
of wedlock is disputed, the determination of paternity shall
be made by the court in a civil action without a jury. A
putative father may not be prohibited from initiating a civil
action to establish paternity. The burden of proof shall be by
a preponderance of the evidence. Bills for pregnancy,
childbirth, postnatal care related to the pregnancy and genetic
testing are admissible as evidence without requiring third-party
foundation testimony and shall constitute prima facie evidence
of amounts incurred for such services or for testing on behalf
of the child. If there is clear and convincing evidence of
paternity on the basis of genetic tests or other evidence, the
court shall upon motion of a party issue a temporary order of
support pending the judicial resolution of a dispute regarding
paternity. The Supreme Court shall provide by general rule for
entry of a default order establishing paternity upon a showing
of service of process on the defendant and a subsequent failure
to appear for scheduled genetic testing.
(b) Limitation of actions.--
(1) An action or proceeding under this chapter to
establish the paternity of a child born out of wedlock must
be commenced within 18 years of the date of birth of the
child.
(2) As of August 16, 1984, the requirement of paragraph
(b)(1) shall also apply to any child for whom paternity has
not yet been established and any child for whom a paternity
action was brought but dismissed because of a prior statute
of limitations of less than 18 years.
(c) Genetic tests.--
(1) Upon the request of any party to an action to
establish paternity, supported by a sworn statement from the
party, the court or domestic relations section shall require
the child and the parties to submit to genetic tests. The
domestic relations section shall obtain an additional genetic
test upon the request and advance payment by any party who
contests the initial test.
(2) Genetic test results indicating a 99% or greater
probability that the alleged father is the father of the
child shall create a presumption of paternity which may be
rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence that the
results of the genetic tests are not reliable in that
particular case.
(3) To ensure the integrity of the specimen and that
the proper chain of custody has been maintained, the genetic
tests of the biological mother, the child or children in
question and the alleged father should be conducted by an
established genetic-testing laboratory in the course of its
regularly conducted business activity, and certified records
should be issued. The certified records shall be admissible
into evidence without further foundation, authentication or
proof of accuracy if no objection is made within ten days
prior to trial. The laboratory must be certified by either
the American Association of Blood Banks or the American
Association for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics.
(4) If the court or domestic relations section orders
genetic testing, the domestic relations section shall pay
the cost of the test, subject to recoupment from the alleged
father if paternity is established.
(5) A determination of paternity made by another state,
whether through judicial proceedings, administrative
proceedings or by acknowledgment of paternity, shall be given
full faith and credit in the courts of this Commonwealth.
(6) A determination of nonpaternity made by another
state with respect to a public assistance recipient shall
not be binding upon the Department of Public Welfare unless
the defendant shows that the department had actual notice
of the proceedings, including the date and time of any trial,
and a fair opportunity to participate in all material
proceedings through counsel of its own choice.

§ 4347. Security for attendance or performance.
At any stage of the proceedings under this chapter, upon
affidavit filed that the obligor is about to leave this
Commonwealth or the judicial district or, where in the judgment
of the court, the obligor has habitually failed to comply with
court orders under this chapter, the court may, as prescribed
by general rule, issue appropriate process directing that the
obligor be brought before the court and may direct that the
obligor give security to appear when directed by the court or
to comply with any order of the court.
§ 4348. Attachment of income.
(a) Existing and certain future orders.--All orders of
support existing as of the effective date of this provision,
as well as all orders of support entered or modified after the
effective date of this provision but before June 30, 1990, shall
provide for mandatory attachment of income:
(1) if the obligor is in arrears in payment in an amount
equal to or greater than one month's support obligation;
(2) at the request of the obligor;
(3) at the request of the obligee; or
(4) as of July 1, 1991, except as provided by subsection
(b)(1) and (2).
(b) Future orders.--All orders of support entered or
modified on or after July 1, 1990, shall, as part of the order,
provide for the mandatory attachment of income unless:
(1) the obligor is not in arrears in payment in an
amount equal to or greater of one month's support obligation;
and
(2) (i) one of the parties demonstrates, and the court
finds, that there is good cause not to require immediate
income withholding; or
(ii) a written agreement is reached between the
parties which provides for an alternative arrangement.
The court may, on its own motion, order the attachment of the
obligor's income where the court has a reasonable basis to
believe the obligor will not comply with the order of support.
In making this determination, the court may consider evidence
of the person's previous violations of orders entered in any
jurisdiction or evidence that the obligor has attempted to
conceal income or to transfer, convey or encumber property in
order to reduce the obligor's support obligation. Attachment
shall occur under this subsection without amendment to the order
of support and, if arrearages occur, without the need for a
judicial or administrative hearing.
(c) Assessment of penalty.--The court may impose a penalty
of not more than 10% on any amount in arrears for 30 days or
more if the court determines that the arrearage was willful.
(d) Arrearages.--If support arrearages exist at the time
of the entry of the order, the order shall specify all of the
following:
(1) To whom an arrearage is owed and the amount of the
arrearage.
(2) The period of time for which the arrearage is
calculated.
(3) The amount of periodic support to be applied to
current support and the amount to be applied to arrearages.
(4) If support arrearages are owed to more than one
obligee, how payments are to be divided and in which
priority.
(5) A direction that all payments are to be credited
to current support obligations first, with any payment in
excess to be applied to arrearages.
(d.1) Insurance.--If an obligor or obligee is in violation
of an order under section 4326(j)(3) (relating to mandatory
inclusion of child medical support), the attachment shall be
in favor of the appropriate provider of health care coverage.
(e) Attachment process.--
(1) The obligor shall be given notice of the attachment
of his income. Such notice shall specify all of the
following:
(i) The amount to be withheld on account of current
support and on account of arrears.
(ii) That the order of attachment shall apply to
current and future employers.
(iii) That the grounds for contesting the order of
attachment shall be limited to mistakes of fact. Mistakes
of fact shall be limited to errors in the amount of
current support owed, errors in the amount of arrearage,
an attachment in excess of the maximum amount set forth
in subsection (g) or mistaken identity of the obligor.
(iv) That attachment has occurred or shall occur
in all cases within ten days of the issuance of the
notice.
(v) A notice of how and when the order may be
contested.
(2) To contest the order, the obligor must appear before
the domestic relations section no later than ten days after
issuance of the notice, at which time it will be determined
if a mistake of fact has occurred. If so, the order shall
be modified accordingly.
(f) Request of obligor.--The court shall also order the
attachment of income where the obligor so requests.
(g) Maximum amount.--The maximum amount of any attachment
under this section shall not exceed the limits set forth in the
Consumer Credit Protection Act (Public Law 90-321, 15 U.S.C. §
1601 et seq.).
(h) Termination.--The court may order the termination of
an order of attachment in any of the following instances:
(1) The support obligation has terminated and the total
arrearages are paid.
(2) Where the payee cannot be located and it becomes
impossible to forward payments.
(3) The result would be unconscionable.
(i) Notice to employer.--The employer of an obligor shall
be given notice of the attachment as provided by the Rules of
Civil Procedure governing support. This notice shall include
reference to subsections (g), (k), (l), (n) and (o) and all of
the following:
(1) The amount to be attached.
(2) That the attachment shall be implemented as soon
as possible and no later than 14 days from the issuance of
the notice to the employer.
(3) That the attachment payment must be sent to the
domestic relations section or State disbursement unit, as
appropriate, within seven business days of the date the
obligor is paid.
(4) That the attachment order is binding upon the
employer until further notice.
(5) That the employer may combine attachment payments
into a single payment to the domestic relations section and
separately identify the portions attributable to each
obligor.
(6) That the employer must notify the domestic relations
section when the obligor terminates employment and provide
his last known address and the new employer's name and
address, if known.
(j) Effect of compliance by employer.--Compliance by an
employer with an order of attachment of income that is regular
on its face operates as a discharge of the civil liability of
the employer to the obligor as to that portion of the employment
income of the obligor affected. An employer shall not be subject
to criminal or civil liability to any individual or agency for
conduct in compliance with the order. The employer may deduct
from the income of the obligor a one-time fee of $50 for
reimbursement of the expense in complying with the order. In
no case shall the employer's reimbursement be deducted from the
amount of the support order.
(k) Effect of noncompliance by employer.--
(1) An employer or officer or employee thereof who
willfully fails to comply with an order of attachment under
this chapter may, as prescribed by general rule, be adjudged
in contempt and committed to jail or fined by the court.
(2) The employer shall be liable for any amount the
employer willfully fails to withhold from income due an
employee under an order of attachment of income and any
amount which is withheld from such income but not forwarded
to the domestic relations office.
(3) The court may, pursuant to general rule, attach
funds or property of an employer.
(l) Disciplinary action by employer prohibited.--
(1) When an order of attachment on income withholding
is about to be or has been entered, an employer or officer
or employee thereof shall not use the attachment or
possibility thereof as a basis, in whole or in part, for the
refusal to employ or for the discharge of an employee or for
any disciplinary action against or demotion of an employee.
In case of a violation of this subsection, the employer or
officer or employee thereof may be adjudged in contempt and
committed to jail or fined by the court.
(2) Any employee aggrieved by a violation of this
subsection shall have the substantive right to bring an
action for damages by reason of such violation in a court
of competent jurisdiction.
(3) The department or a domestic relations section may
impose a civil penalty of up to $1,000 per violation against
any employer that willfully violates the provisions of this
subsection or that willfully fails to withhold income or to
pay such amounts to the State disbursement unit.
(m) Certify income.--Upon request of the domestic relations
section, the employer shall report and certify the income of
an employee.
(n) Bonding.--The court may attach forms of income other
than wages, assets, including spendthrift trusts, and private,
public, State, county and municipal pensions, and include
bonding or other requirements in cases involving obligors whose
income is from sources other than wages, in order to assure
that support owed by obligors in this Commonwealth will be
collected without regard to the types of these obligors' income
or the nature of their income-producing activities.
(o) Priority of attachment.--(Deleted by amendment).
(p) Nonresidents.--Income attachment shall be available to
obligees residing outside this Commonwealth where the income
of the obligor is derived in this Commonwealth.
(q) Priority of attachment.--An order of attachment for
support shall have priority over any attachment, execution,
garnishment or wage assignment. The Supreme Court shall by
general rule provide for priorities for withholding and
allocating income withheld for multiple child support obligees
received by an employer for the same obligor under this section
and Chapter 75 (relating to direct enforcement of order of
another state without registration).
(r) Information requests.--
(1) Upon the request of the department, a county
domestic relations section or a child support agency of
another state, any employer doing business within this
Commonwealth, including a for-profit, not-for-profit or
governmental employer, shall promptly provide information
regarding the employment, compensation and benefits of any
employee or contractor of the employer.
(2) In addition to any other remedy allowed by law, the
department may impose a civil penalty of up to $1,000 per
violation on an individual or entity that willfully fails
to comply with a request for information under paragraph
(1).

Cross References. Section 4351 is referred to in section
4374 of this title.
§ 4352. Continuing jurisdiction over support orders.
(a) General rule.--The court making an order of support
shall at all times maintain jurisdiction of the matter for the
purpose of enforcement of the order and for the purpose of
increasing, decreasing, modifying or rescinding the order unless
otherwise provided by Part VIII (relating to uniform interstate
family support) or VIII-A (relating to intrastate family
support) without limiting the right of the obligee, or the
department if it has an assignment or other interest, to
institute additional proceedings for support in any county in
which the obligor resides or in which property of the obligor
is situated. The Supreme Court shall by general rule establish
procedures by which each interested party shall be notified of
all proceedings in which support obligations might be
established or modified and shall receive a copy of any order
issued in a case within 14 days after issuance of such order.
A petition for modification of a support order may be filed at
any time and shall be granted if the requesting party
demonstrates a substantial change in circumstances.
(a.1) Automatic review.--Upon request of either parent, or
automatically if there is an assignment under Title IV-A of the
Social Security Act (49 Stat. 620, 42 U.S.C. § 301 et seq.),
each order of support shall be reviewed at least once every
three years from the date of establishment or the most recent
review. The review shall be for the purpose of making any
appropriate increase, decrease, modification or rescission of
the order. During the review, taking into the account the best
interest of the child involved, the court shall adjust the
order, without requiring proof of a change in circumstances,
by applying the Statewide guidelines or a cost-of-living
adjustment in accordance with a formula developed by general
rule. Automated methods, including automated matches with wage
or State income tax data, may be used to identify the support
orders eligible for review and implement appropriate
adjustments.
(a.2) Effect of incarceration.--Incarceration, except
incarceration for nonpayment of support, shall constitute a
material and substantial change in circumstance that may warrant
modification or termination of an order of support where the
obligor lacks verifiable income or assets sufficient to enforce
and collect amounts due.
(b) Notice.--Each party subject to an automatic child
support review shall receive:
(1) thirty days' advance notice of the right of such
party to request a review and adjustment of the order, except
when the adjustment results from a cost-of-living adjustment
or other automated adjustment;
(2) a copy of any order establishing, modifying or
rescinding a child support obligation or, in the case of a
denied petition for modification, a notice of determination
that there should be no change in the amount of the child
support order, within 14 days after issuance of such order
or determination; and
(3) a 30-day period from the date of the notice of a
cost-of-living adjustment or other automated adjustment to
request an individual review and adjustment in accordance
with the Statewide guideline.
(c) Transfer of action.--Where neither party to the action
resides or is employed in the county wherein the support action
was filed, the court may transfer the matter to any county
wherein either party resides or where the defendant is regularly
employed. If one of the parties resides outside of this
Commonwealth, the action may be transferred to the county of
residence or employment of the other party.
(d) Arrears as judgments.--On and after the date it is due,
each and every support obligation shall constitute a judgment
against the obligor by operation of law, with the full force,
effect and attributes of a judgment of court, including the
ability to be enforced, and shall be entitled as a judgment to
full faith and credit in this or any other state. Overdue
support obligations of this or any other state which are on
record at the county domestic relations section shall constitute
a lien by operation of law against all real property owned by
the obligor within the county as provided in subsection (d.1).
The department shall develop and implement a system for
providing notice to the public of liens arising out of overdue
support obligations. The system and its procedures shall ensure
convenient access to lien information and shall address hours
of access by the business community and the general public and
access via modem or automated means. Thirty days after
publication of notice in the Pennsylvania Bulletin that the
system has been established, any lien on record shall constitute
a lien against any real property in this Commonwealth owned by
the obligor and shall also have the effect of a fully perfected
security interest in personal property owned by the obligor in
which a security interest can arise. The department shall
consult with the Department of Transportation in the development
of this system to enforce compliance with this subsection as
it applies to liens on motor vehicles. The Supreme Court shall
by general rule establish procedures for the recording of liens
of other states at the county domestic relations section and
for the enforcement of liens arising from overdue support
without prior judicial notice or hearing. A bona fide good faith
purchaser of personal property for value which is subject to a
lien under this subsection acquires all title which the
transferor had or had the power to transfer pursuant to 13
Pa.C.S. Ch. 24 (relating to title, creditors and good faith
purchasers), and the obligee shall have all rights against such
property which would be preserved to a fully perfected secured
creditor under 13 Pa.C.S. Div. 9 (relating to secured
transactions; sales of accounts, contract rights and chattel
paper). The obligation for payment of arrears or overdue support
shall terminate by operation of law when all arrears or overdue
support has been paid.
(d.1) Real property liens.--
(1) Overdue support shall be a lien on real estate
within the county in which the overdue support is on record
at the county domestic relations section if:
(i) the underlying support action is pending in the
county domestic relations section or is being enforced
by the county domestic relations section;
(ii) notice of the existence of the support action
is available to the public through a docket book or
automated means; and
(iii) the county domestic relations section is able
to determine the amount of overdue support by reference
to its records and is able to provide the amount of the
overdue support upon request.
(2) The priority and amount of a lien for overdue
support shall be determined as follows:
(i) The date of the lien for purposes of determining
priority shall be determined separately for each unpaid
overdue support payment. The date shall be the later of:
(A) the date the obligor obtains a real property
interest which may be subject to a lien;
(B) the date the overdue support becomes a lien
under paragraph (1); or
(C) January 1, 1998.
(ii) The amount of the lien on any date shall be
the amount of overdue support shown on that date in the
records of the domestic relations section.
(3) Upon request of any person, the domestic relations
section shall issue a written certification of the amount
of overdue support owed by an individual as of the date of
the certification and shall note on the docket the date of
certification and the amount certified. The interests of any
purchaser of real estate for value, mortgagee or other lienor
that in good faith purchases the real estate or lends money
on the security of the real estate and that records, within
30 days before or 60 days after the date of issuance of a
certificate under this paragraph, a deed, mortgage or other
encumbrance against the real estate shall not be subject to
any lien for overdue support in excess of the amount shown
on the certification.
(4) The amount of overdue support owed by an obligor
and the name of the obligor shall be public information and
shall be deemed a public record subject to the act of June
21, 1957 (P.L.390, No.212), referred to as the Right-to-Know
Law.
(5) A lien arising from overdue support:
(i) shall automatically attach to after-acquired
property owned by the obligor;
(ii) shall retain its priority without renewal or
revival;
(iii) shall continue to encumber the property upon
sale or other transfer;
(iv) shall not be divested upon a judicial sale or
execution by a person with a lien with less priority;
(v) shall not attach to the interest of any other
co-owner in the property;
(vi) shall expire 20 years after the due date of

report of the overdue support obligations of an obligor;
(iii) shall provide to the prothonotary of the
county the identity of obligors and amount of overdue
support to be used to make the information available to
the public. The information shall be updated at least
monthly and shall be provided by a paper listing,
diskette or any other electronic means until the
Statewide system under subsection (d) is implemented;
and
(iv) shall transmit at least every 60 days to credit
bureaus directly or through the department reports and
updates regarding the liens for overdue support.
(7) The domestic relations section or employees thereof

overdue support except as provided in 42 Pa.C.S. § 8550

(8) Support may cease to be overdue if a revised payment
schedule is established by the court, but any lien which has
previously arisen against real estate shall remain in effect
until paid or divested.
(9) Notwithstanding paragraphs (2) and (3), the
interests of any person who recorded a deed, mortgage or
other instrument creating an interest in or lien against
real estate on or after January 1, 1998, and before the

or lien was recorded.
(e) Retroactive modification of arrears.--No court shall
modify or remit any support obligation, on or after the date
it is due, except with respect to any period during which there
is pending a petition for modification. If a petition for
modification was filed, modification may be applied to the
period beginning on the date that notice of such petition was
given, either directly or through the appropriate agent, to the
obligee or, where the obligee was the petitioner, to the
obligor. However, modification may be applied to an earlier
period if the petitioner was precluded from filing a petition
for modification by reason of a significant physical or mental
disability, misrepresentation of another party or other
compelling reason and if the petitioner, when no longer
precluded, promptly filed a petition. In the case of an
emancipated child, arrears shall not accrue from and after the
date of the emancipation of the child for whose support the
payment is made.
(f) Foreign support orders.--(Deleted by amendment).
(g) Notice to obligors and obligees.--The domestic relations
section shall mail notice to obligors and obligees of existing

Further, the notice shall advise each party to a support
proceeding of the party's duty to advise the domestic relations
section of material changes in circumstance and of the necessity
to promptly request a modification as soon as circumstances
change.
(g.1) Nondisclosure of certain information.--If the court
finds in an ex parte or other proceeding or if an existing order
provides that the health, safety or liberty of a party or child
would be unreasonably put at risk by the disclosure of
identifying information, the court shall order that the address
of the child or party or other identifying information not be
disclosed in a pleading or other document filed in a proceeding
under this part. Any court order under this subsection must be
docketed in the domestic relations section.
(g.2) Work activities.--If an obligor owes overdue support
with respect to any child receiving cash or medical assistance,
the court shall upon motion of the department or domestic
relations section order that overdue support be paid in
accordance with a plan approved by the court or that the obligor
participate in work activities approved by the department. Work
activities include:
(1) Subsidized or unsubsidized public or private sector
employment.
(2) Work experience programs.

(g.3) Voidable transfers.--The court may void any voidable
transfer by the obligor pursuant to 12 Pa.C.S. Ch. 51 (relating
to voidable transactions). It shall be a rebuttable presumption
that a transfer by an obligor is voidable as to an obligee if
the transfer was made for less than reasonably equivalent value
and the transfer occurred after the initiation of a proceeding
to establish or enforce support.
(h) Applicability.--This section applies to all support
orders whether entered under this chapter or any other statute.

be entitled to under any order of court for the support of
plaintiff or the children of defendant.

interest on the sums due the plaintiff for support from the
time the respective sums become due.

spouse for the support of the children of the former spouse as
fully as if no divorce had occurred.

for the collection of any sums of money due the divorced spouse
under an order of court, the divorced spouse shall be entitled

(a) Seeking support required.--Prior to authorization, every
applicant for assistance whose circumstances include the

household or the presence of a putative father shall appear
before the domestic relations section or other applicable
division of the court of common pleas. Upon the request of a
family court or domestic relations section, the secretary is

before a family court or domestic relations section if another
procedure would be as efficient and effective. Subject to
Federal approval, only when necessary, assistance shall not be
authorized by the department until it has been certified that
the applicant has cooperated in determining paternity and
enforcing support.
(b) Assignment.--Acceptance of assistance shall operate as
an assignment to the department, by operation of law, of the
assistance recipient's rights to receive support on his or her
own behalf and on behalf of any family member with respect to
whom the recipient is receiving assistance. Such assignment
shall be effective only up to the amount of assistance received
during the period that a family receives assistance. The
assignment shall exclude arrears that accrued prior to receipt
of assistance. The assignment shall take effect at the time
that the recipient is determined to be eligible for assistance.
Upon termination of assistance payments, the assignment of
support rights shall terminate, provided that any amount of
unpaid support obligations shall continue as an obligation to
and collectible by the department to the extent of any
unreimbursed assistance consistent with Federal law. Immediately
upon receipt of notification from the department that a
recipient has been determined to be eligible for assistance,
the clerks of the appropriate courts of the Commonwealth shall
transmit any and all support payments that they thereafter
receive on behalf of such assistance recipients to the
department. Such clerks shall continue transmitting such support
payments until notified by the department that it is no longer
necessary to do so. While the recipient is receiving assistance,
any such support payments made to or on behalf of the assistance
recipient shall be allocated to any amount due the department
as assignee of the recipient's support rights consistent with
Federal law. The assistance recipient shall be deemed to have
appointed the department as his attorney-in-fact to endorse
over to the department any and all drafts, checks, money orders
or other negotiable instruments submitted for payment of support
due during the time the recipient is receiving assistance on
behalf of himself, herself or any family member.
(c) Standing.--An applicant or recipient shall have standing
to commence an action to obtain support for any child with
respect to whom the applicant or recipient claims assistance.

number or, to the extent permitted by Federal law, proof
of making application for a Social Security account
number if the applicant or recipient has no Social
Security account number.
(ii) Assign to the department on forms provided by
the department such support rights as the applicant or
recipient may have individually or on behalf of any
family member who is a part of the assistance group.

is claimed unless the department determines that the
applicant or recipient has good cause for failing to do
so.
(iv) Cooperate in obtaining support payments for
such applicant or recipient and for a child with respect
to whom such assistance is claimed or in obtaining any
other payment or property due such applicant, recipient
or such child unless the department determines that the
applicant or recipient has good cause for failing to do
so.
(2) Require cooperation in accordance with the
following:
(i) Subject to Federal approval, only when
necessary, cooperation shall include, but not be limited
to, taking the following actions:

whom assistance is sought or received, including
appearing for scheduled genetic testing with the
child and submitting to such testing.

by the domestic relations section.
(F) Paying to the department any support payment

noncooperation which may be rebutted only by clear and
convincing evidence.
(iii) Subject to Federal approval, if the applicant
or recipient provides the names of two putative fathers
subsequently excluded from paternity by genetic testing,

§ 4380. Enforcement of cooperation requirements.
(a) Cooperation required.--It is essential to the effective
and responsible utilization of assistance funds that applicants
and recipients who are caretakers of a child whose circumstances
include the reported absence of a legally responsible relative
from the household or presence of a putative father cooperate
fully with the department and the court or domestic relations
section in establishing paternity and in securing child support
payments and in all matters set forth in section 4379 (relating
to cooperation required).
(b) Procedures.--
(1) Upon application for assistance, each applicant or
recipient shall be notified that his or her cooperation in
the matters set forth in section 4379 shall be required as
a condition of eligibility and that failure to cooperate
will result in the termination of medical assistance and the
reduction of the cash assistance allowance in an amount equal
to not less than 25% and may, if provided by departmental
regulation, result in the imposition of protective payments
for any child in whose behalf the applicant or recipient
seeks assistance.
(2) If the department or domestic relations section,
as applicable, determines that the applicant or recipient
fails to cooperate as set forth in section 4379, unless the
failure to cooperate was for good cause, the applicant or
recipient shall be notified of the noncooperation
determination and the basis for the noncooperation
determination. The department shall notify the applicant or
recipient in writing of the termination of medical assistance
eligibility for the applicant or recipient, the reduction
of the cash assistance allowance equal to not less than 25%
and, if applicable, that protective payments will be imposed
for any child so affected ten days after the date of notice.
At the expiration of the ten-day period, the department shall
impose the termination of medical assistance, the assistance
allowance reduction and, if applicable, protective payments.
Any hearing or appeal with respect to the notice of
noncooperation issued by the department shall be conducted
in accordance with the department's regulations governing
an applicant's or a recipient's right to hearings.
(3) Subject to Federal approval, only when necessary,
if after notice and opportunity for hearing the court or
domestic relations section determines that the applicant or
recipient failed to cooperate as set forth in section 4379
and lacked reasonable excuse for such failure, the court
shall notify the applicant or recipient and the department
of the basis of the noncooperation determination and order
the department to impose a sanction for noncooperation. The
department shall issue a notice to the applicant or recipient
to terminate medical assistance eligibility, reduce the
assistance allowance by not less than 25% and, if applicable,
impose a protective payment for any child so affected. The
department shall implement the order of the court within ten
days of receipt. Any hearing or appeals with respect to the
recommendation and order of noncooperation directed by the
court shall be conducted by the court in accordance with the
Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure as may be promulgated
by the Supreme Court governing actions for support. The
decision to hold hearings for noncooperation cases shall be
at the option of the court or domestic relations section.
If the court or domestic relations section chooses not to
conduct the hearings on noncooperation, appropriate court
or domestic relations section personnel shall be available
to provide testimonial evidence by telephone testimony at
the time and location set by the department for the
departmental appeal hearing. A finding of noncooperation of
an applicant or recipient shall not affect an obligor's duty
to pay support.
§ 4381. Garnishment of wages of Commonwealth employees.
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, moneys due from
or payable by the Commonwealth, including any agency,
instrumentality or authority thereof, due to any individual
shall be subject, in like manner and to the same extent as if
the Commonwealth were a private person, to legal process brought
for the enforcement against such individual of his legal
obligations to provide support for a child or spouse.

irrespective of the marital status of their parents, and, in
every case where children are born out of wedlock, they shall
enjoy all the rights and privileges as if they had been born
during the wedlock of their parents except as otherwise provided
in Title 20 (relating to decedents, estates and fiduciaries).
(b) Determination of paternity.--For purposes of prescribing

the father, paternity shall be determined by any one of the
following ways:
(1) If the parents of a child born out of wedlock have

openly holds out the child to be his and either receives the
child into his home or provides support for the child.
(3) If there is clear and convincing evidence that the
man was the father of the child, which may include a prior
court determination of paternity.
§ 5103. Acknowledgment and claim of paternity.
(a) Acknowledgment of paternity.--The father of a child
born to an unmarried woman may file with the Department of
Public Welfare, on forms prescribed by the department, an
acknowledgment of paternity of the child which shall include
the consent of the mother of the child, supported by her
witnessed statement subject to 18 Pa.C.S. § 4904 (relating to

shall have all the rights and duties as to the child which he
would have had if he had been married to the mother at the time
of the birth of the child, and the child shall have all the
rights and duties as to the father which the child would have
had if the father had been married to the mother at the time
of birth. The hospital or other person accepting an

alternatives to, the legal consequences of and the rights and
responsibilities that arise from, signing the acknowledgment.
(b) Claim of paternity.--If the mother of the child fails
or refuses to join in the acknowledgment of paternity provided

claim of paternity shall not confer upon the putative father
any rights as to the child except that the putative father shall
be entitled to notice of any proceeding brought to terminate
any parental rights as to the child.
(c) Duty of hospital or birthing center.--Upon the birth
of a child to an unmarried woman, an agent of the hospital or

completed, signed and witnessed acknowledgment shall be sent
to the Department of Public Welfare. A copy shall be given
to each of the birth parents. This acknowledgment shall
contain:
(i) A signed, witnessed statement subject to 18
Pa.C.S. § 4904 (relating to unsworn falsification to
authorities) by the birth mother consenting to the
acknowledgment of paternity.

and parental rights which arise from signing such a
statement.

explains the benefits of having the child's paternity
established, the availability of paternity establishment
services and the availability of child support enforcement
agencies.
(d) Conclusive evidence.--Notwithstanding any other
provision of law, an acknowledgment of paternity shall
constitute conclusive evidence of paternity without further
judicial ratification in any action to establish support. The
court shall give full faith and credit to an acknowledgment of
paternity signed in another state according to its procedures.
(e) Transfer.--The Department of Health shall transfer to
the Department of Public Welfare all acknowledgments or claims
of paternity filed with the Department of Health under prior

adoptive child.
(g) Rescission.--
(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a
signed, voluntary, witnessed acknowledgment of paternity
subject to 18 Pa.C.S. § 4904 shall be considered a legal
finding of paternity, subject to the right of any signatory
to rescind the acknowledgment within the earlier of the
following:
(i) sixty days; or
(ii) the date of an administrative or judicial
proceeding relating to the child, including, but not
limited to, a domestic relations section conference or
a proceeding to establish a support order in which the
signatory is a party.
(2) After the expiration of the 60 days, an
acknowledgment of paternity may be challenged in court only
on the basis of fraud, duress or material mistake of fact,
which must be established by the challenger through clear
and convincing evidence. An order for support shall not be
suspended during the period of challenge except for good
cause shown.
(h) Penalties for noncompliance.--The department may impose
a civil penalty not to exceed $500 per day upon a hospital or
birthing center which is not in compliance with the provisions
of this section. A penalty under this subsection is subject to

of Commonwealth agencies) and Ch. 7 Subch. A (relating to
judicial review of Commonwealth agency action).

child against the party or enforce its order if the rights of
others and the interests of justice so require.
(d) Selection of experts.--The tests shall be made by
experts qualified as examiners of blood types, who shall be
appointed by the court. The experts shall be called by the court
as witnesses to testify to their findings and shall be subject
to cross-examination by the parties. Any party or person at
whose suggestion the tests have been ordered may demand that

independent tests under order of court, the results of which
may be offered in evidence. The number and qualifications of
experts shall be determined by the court.

expert witness appointed by the court shall be fixed at a
reasonable amount. It shall be paid as the court shall order.
Subject to general rules, the court may order that it be paid
by the parties in such proportions and at such times as it shall
prescribe or that the proportion of any party be paid by the
county and that, after payment by the parties or the county,
or both, all or part or none of it be taxed as costs in the
action. Subject to general rules, the fee of an expert witness
called by a party but not appointed by the court shall be paid
by the party calling him, but shall not be taxed as costs in
the action.
(f) Effect of test results.--If the court finds that the
conclusions of all the experts as disclosed by the evidence
based upon the tests are that the alleged father is not the
father of the child, the question of paternity, parentage or
identity of a child shall be resolved accordingly. If the
experts disagree in their findings or conclusions, the question
shall be submitted upon all the evidence.
(g) Effect on presumption of legitimacy.--The presumption
of legitimacy of a child born during wedlock is overcome if the
court finds that the conclusions of all the experts as disclosed
by the evidence based upon the tests show that the husband is
not the father of the child.
§ 5105. Fingerprinting of children.
Notwithstanding the provisions of 54 Pa.C.S. § 702(b)

the court may issue an ex parte warrant to take physical custody
of the child.
(b) Hearing.--The respondent on a petition under subsection
(a) must be afforded an opportunity to be heard at the earliest
possible time after the ex parte warrant is executed, but not
later than the next judicial day unless a hearing on that date
is impossible. In that event, the court shall hold the hearing
on the first judicial day possible.

petition.
(4) Provide for the safe interim placement of the child
pending further order of the court.

system and similar state databases to determine if either the
petitioner or respondent has a history of domestic violence,
stalking or child abuse or neglect.
(e) Service.--The petition and warrant must be served on
the respondent when or immediately after the child is taken
into physical custody.
(f) Enforcement.--
(1) A warrant to take physical custody of a child,
issued by this Commonwealth or another state, is enforceable
throughout this Commonwealth.

will not be effective, it may authorize law enforcement
officers to enter private property to take physical custody
of the child. If required by exigent circumstances, the court
may authorize law enforcement officers to make a forcible
entry at any hour.
(g) Fees and costs.--If the court finds, after a hearing,
that a petitioner sought an ex parte warrant under subsection
(a) for the purpose of harassment or in bad faith, the court
may award the respondent reasonable attorney fees, costs and
expenses.
(h) Other relief.--This chapter does not affect the
availability of relief allowed under the laws of this
Commonwealth other than this chapter.

be given to the need to promote uniformity of the law with
respect to its subject matter among states that enact it.

(1) After considering the factors under sections 5328,
5329 (relating to consideration of criminal conviction),
5329.1 (relating to consideration of child abuse and
involvement with protective services) and 5330 (relating to
consideration of criminal charge), if the court finds a
history of abuse of the child or a household member by a
party or a present risk of harm to the child or an abused
party and awards any form of custody to a party who committed
the abuse or who has a household member who committed the
abuse, the court shall include in the custody order:
(i) The safety conditions, restrictions or
safeguards as reasonably necessary to protect the child
or the abused party.
(ii) The reason for imposing the safety conditions,
restrictions or safeguards, including an explanation why
the safety conditions, restrictions or safeguards are
in the best interest of the child or the abused party.
(iii) The reasons why unsupervised physical custody
is in the best interest of the child if the court finds
that past abuse was committed by a party.
(2) If supervised contact is ordered, there shall be a
review of the risk of harm and need for continued supervision
upon petition of the party. The safety conditions,
restrictions or safeguards may include any of the following:
(i) Nonprofessional supervised physical custody.
(ii) Professional supervised physical custody.
(iii) Limitations on the time of day that physical

specializing in programming relating to the history of
abuse or risk of harm to provide batterer's intervention
and harm prevention programming. Batterer's intervention
and harm prevention programming may include programming
designed to rehabilitate the offending individual,
including prioritizing a batterer's intervention and
harm prevention program, if available, or the impacts

court may order an evaluation by the appointed qualified
professional under this paragraph to determine whether
additional programming is necessary.
(v) Limitations on legal custody.
(vi) Any other safety condition, restriction or
safeguard as necessary to ensure the safety of the child
or to protect a household member.
(e.1) Supervised physical custody.--If a court finds by a
preponderance of the evidence that there is an ongoing risk of
abuse of the child, there shall be a rebuttable presumption
that the court shall only allow supervised physical custody
between the child and the party who poses the risk of abuse. A
court may find that an indicated report for physical or sexual
abuse under Chapter 63 (relating to child protective services)
is a basis for a finding of abuse under this subsection only
after a de novo review of the circumstances leading to the
indicated report. When awarding supervised physical custody
under this subsection, the court shall favor professional
supervised physical custody. The court may award nonprofessional
supervised physical custody if:
(1) the court determines that professional supervised
physical custody is not available within a reasonable
distance of the parties or the court determines that the
party requiring supervised physical custody is unable to pay
for the professional supervised physical custody; and

to cooperate with the other party. A party's reasonable
concerns for the safety of the child and the party's

considered attempts to turn the child against the other
party. A child's deficient or negative relationship with
a party shall not be presumed to be caused by the other
party.
(3) A willingness and ability of a party to prioritize
the needs of the child by providing appropriate care,
stability and continuity for the child, considering the
parental duties performed by the party on behalf of the child
in the past and whether the party is willing and able to
perform the duties in the future, and attend to the daily
physical, emotional, developmental, educational and special
needs of the child.

related to the factor were in response to abuse or necessary
to protect the child or the abused party from harm and the party

at the time of the custody hearing. Temporary housing
instability as a result of abuse shall not be considered against
the party alleging abuse.
(a.2) Determination.--No single factor under subsection (a)
shall by itself be determinative in the awarding of custody.
The court shall examine the totality of the circumstances,
giving weighted consideration to the factors that affect the
safety of the child, when issuing a custody order that is in
the best interest of the child.
(b) Gender neutral.--In making a determination under

of a custody complaint, petition for the modification of custody

rehabilitation of the offending individual and the well-being
of the child subsequent to the order. If, upon review of a
subsequent evaluation, the court determines that the
offending individual poses a threat of physical, emotional
or psychological harm to the child, the court may schedule
a hearing to modify the custody order.

(b) Powers and duties.--The guardian ad litem shall be
charged with representation of the legal interests and the best
interests of the child during the proceedings and shall do all
of the following:
(1) If appropriate to the child's age and maturity,
meet with the child as soon as possible following the

(8) Advise the court of the child's wishes to the extent
that they can be ascertained and present to the court

I understand that in addition to checking (2) or (3) above, I
must also file this notice with the court in writing and serve
it on the other party by certified mail, return receipt
requested. If I fail to do so within 30 days of my receipt of

objecting to the relocation.
................................................................
I verify that the statements made in this counter-affidavit are
true and correct. I understand that false statements herein are
made subject to the penalties of 18 Pa.C.S. § 4904 (relating

Date:
................................................................
................................................................
(2) An objection made under this subsection shall be
filed with the court within 30 days of receipt of the
proposed relocation notice and served on the other party by
certified mail, return receipt requested.
(3) If notice of the proposed relocation has been
properly given and no objection to the proposed relocation
has been filed in court, then it shall be presumed that the
nonrelocating party has consented to the proposed relocation.
(4) If a party who has been given proper notice does
not file with the court an objection to the relocation within
30 days after receipt of the notice but later petitions the
court for review of the custodial arrangements, the court
shall not accept testimony challenging the relocation.
(e) Confirmation of relocation.--If no objection to the
proposed relocation is filed under subsection (d), the party
proposing the relocation shall file the following with the court
prior to the relocation:
(1) an affidavit stating that the party provided notice
to every individual entitled to notice, the time to file an
objection to the proposed relocation has passed and no
individual entitled to receive notice has filed an objection
to the proposed relocation;
(2) Proof that proper notice was given in the form of
a return receipt with the signature of the addressee and the
full notice that was sent to the addressee.
(3) a petition to confirm the relocation and modify any
existing custody order; and
(4) a proposed order containing the information set
forth in subsection (c)(3).
(f) Modification of custody order.--If a counter-affidavit
regarding relocation is filed with the court which indicates
the nonrelocating party both has no objection to the proposed
relocation and no objection to the modification of the custody
order consistent with the proposal for revised custody schedule,
the court may modify the existing custody order by approving
the proposal for revised custody schedule submitted under
subsection (c)(3)(viii), and shall specify the method by which
its future modification can be made if desired by either party.
If a counter-affidavit regarding relocation is filed with the
court which indicates the nonrelocating party objects either
to the proposed relocation or to the modification of the custody
order consistent with the proposal for revised custody schedule,
the court shall modify the existing custody order only after
holding a hearing to establish the terms and conditions of the
order pursuant to the relocation indicating the rights, if any,
of the nonrelocating parties.
(g) Hearing.--
(1) Except as set forth in paragraph (3), the court
shall hold an expedited full hearing on the proposed
relocation after a timely objection has been filed and before
the relocation occurs.
(2) Except as set forth in paragraph (3), the court
may, on its own motion, hold an expedited full hearing on
the proposed relocation before the relocation occurs.
(3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), if the court
finds that exigent circumstances exist, the court may approve
the relocation pending an expedited full hearing.
(4) If the court approves the proposed relocation, it
shall:
(i) modify any existing custody order; or
(ii) establish the terms and conditions of a custody
order.
(h) Relocation factors.--In determining whether to grant a
proposed relocation, the court shall consider the following
factors, giving weighted consideration to those factors which
affect the safety of the child:
(1) The nature, quality, extent of involvement and
duration of the child's relationship with the party proposing
to relocate and with the nonrelocating party, siblings and
other significant persons in the child's life.
(2) The age, developmental stage, needs of the child
and the likely impact the relocation will have on the child's
physical, educational and emotional development, taking into
consideration any special needs of the child.
(3) The feasibility of preserving the relationship
between the nonrelocating party and the child through
suitable custody arrangements, considering the logistics and
financial circumstances of the parties.
(4) The child's preference, taking into consideration
the age and maturity of the child.
(5) Whether there is an established pattern of conduct
of either party to promote or thwart the relationship of the
child and the other party.
(6) Whether the relocation will enhance the general
quality of life for the party seeking the relocation,
including, but not limited to, financial or emotional benefit
or educational opportunity.
(7) Whether the relocation will enhance the general
quality of life for the child, including, but not limited
to, financial or emotional benefit or educational
opportunity.
(8) The reasons and motivation of each party for seeking
or opposing the relocation.
(9) The present and past abuse committed by a party or
member of the party's household and whether there is a
continued risk of harm to the child or an abused party.
(10) Any other factor affecting the best interest of
the child.
(i) Burden of proof.--
(1) The party proposing the relocation has the burden
of establishing that the relocation will serve the best
interest of the child as shown under the factors set forth
in subsection (h).
(2) Each party has the burden of establishing the
integrity of that party's motives in either seeking the
relocation or seeking to prevent the relocation.
(j) Failure to provide reasonable notice.--The court may
consider a failure to provide reasonable notice of a proposed
relocation as:
(1) a factor in making a determination regarding the
relocation;
(2) a factor in determining whether custody rights
should be modified;
(3) a basis for ordering the return of the child to the
nonrelocating party if the relocation has occurred without
reasonable notice;
(4) sufficient cause to order the party proposing the
relocation to pay reasonable expenses and counsel fees
incurred by the party objecting to the relocation; and
(5) a ground for contempt and the imposition of
sanctions against the party proposing the relocation.
(k) Mitigation.--Any consideration of a failure to provide
reasonable notice under subsection (i) shall be subject to
mitigation if the court determines that such failure was caused
in whole, or in part, by abuse.
(l) Effect of relocation prior to hearing.--If a party
relocates with the child prior to a full expedited hearing, the
court shall not confer any presumption in favor of the
relocation.

§ 5421. Initial child custody jurisdiction.
(a) General rule.--Except as otherwise provided in section
5424 (relating to temporary emergency jurisdiction), a court
of this Commonwealth has jurisdiction to make an initial child
custody determination only if:
(1) this Commonwealth is the home state of the child
on the date of the commencement of the proceeding or was the
home state of the child within six months before the
commencement of the proceeding and the child is absent from
this Commonwealth but a parent or person acting as a parent
continues to live in this Commonwealth;
(2) a court of another state does not have jurisdiction
under paragraph (1) or a court of the home state of the child
has declined to exercise jurisdiction on the ground that
this Commonwealth is the more appropriate forum under section
5427 (relating to inconvenient forum) or 5428 (relating to
jurisdiction declined by reason of conduct) and:
(i) the child and the child's parents, or the child
and at least one parent or a person acting as a parent,
have a significant connection with this Commonwealth
other than mere physical presence; and
(ii) substantial evidence is available in this
Commonwealth concerning the child's care, protection,
training and personal relationships;
(3) all courts having jurisdiction under paragraph (1)
or (2) have declined to exercise jurisdiction on the ground
that a court of this Commonwealth is the more appropriate
forum to determine the custody of the child under section
5427 or 5428; or
(4) no court of any other state would have jurisdiction
under the criteria specified in paragraph (1), (2) or (3).
(b) Exclusive jurisdictional basis.--Subsection (a) is the
exclusive jurisdictional basis for making a child custody
determination by a court of this Commonwealth.
(c) Physical presence and personal jurisdiction
unnecessary.--Physical presence of or personal jurisdiction
over a party or a child is not necessary or sufficient to make
a child custody determination.
Cross References. Section 5421 is referred to in sections
5210, 5422, 5423, 5424, 5428 of this title.
§ 5422. Exclusive, continuing jurisdiction.
(a) General rule.--Except as otherwise provided in section
5424 (relating to temporary emergency jurisdiction), a court
of this Commonwealth which has made a child custody
determination consistent with section 5421 (relating to initial
child custody jurisdiction) or 5423 (relating to jurisdiction
to modify determination) has exclusive, continuing jurisdiction
over the determination until:
(1) a court of this Commonwealth determines that neither
the child, nor the child and one parent, nor the child and
a person acting as a parent have a significant connection
with this Commonwealth and that substantial evidence is no
longer available in this Commonwealth concerning the child's
care, protection, training and personal relationships; or
(2) a court of this Commonwealth or a court of another
state determines that the child, the child's parents and any
person acting as a parent do not presently reside in this
Commonwealth.
(b) Modification where court does not have exclusive,
continuing jurisdiction.--A court of this Commonwealth which
has made a child custody determination and does not have
exclusive, continuing jurisdiction under this section may modify
that determination only if it has jurisdiction to make an
initial determination under section 5421.
Cross References. Section 5422 is referred to in sections
5210, 5423, 5424, 5428 of this title.
§ 5423. Jurisdiction to modify determination.
Except as otherwise provided in section 5424 (relating to
temporary emergency jurisdiction), a court of this Commonwealth
may not modify a child custody determination made by a court
of another state unless a court of this Commonwealth has
jurisdiction to make an initial determination under section
5421(a)(1) or (2) (relating to initial child custody
jurisdiction) and:
(1) the court of the other state determines it no longer
has exclusive, continuing jurisdiction under section 5422
(relating to exclusive, continuing jurisdiction) or that a
court of this Commonwealth would be a more convenient forum
under section 5427 (relating to inconvenient forum); or
(2) a court of this Commonwealth or a court of the other
state determines that the child, the child's parents and any
person acting as a parent do not presently reside in the
other state.
Cross References. Section 5423 is referred to in sections
5210, 5422, 5424, 5428 of this title.
§ 5424. Temporary emergency jurisdiction.
(a) General rule.--A court of this Commonwealth has
temporary emergency jurisdiction if the child is present in
this Commonwealth and the child has been abandoned or it is
necessary in an emergency to protect the child because the child
or a sibling or parent of the child is subjected to or
threatened with mistreatment or abuse.
(b) No previous custody determination or proceeding.--If
there is no previous child custody determination that is
entitled to be enforced under this chapter and a child custody
proceeding has not been commenced in a court of a state having
jurisdiction under sections 5421 (relating to initial child
custody jurisdiction) through 5423 (relating to jurisdiction
to modify determination), a child custody determination made
under this section remains in effect until an order is obtained
from a court of a state having jurisdiction under sections 5421
through 5423. If a child custody proceeding has not been or is
not commenced in a court of a state having jurisdiction under
sections 5421 through 5423, a child custody determination made
under this section becomes a final determination if it so
provides and this Commonwealth becomes the home state of the
child.
(c) Previous custody determination or proceeding.--If there
is a previous child custody determination that is entitled to
be enforced under this chapter or a child custody proceeding
has been commenced in a court of a state having jurisdiction
under sections 5421 through 5423, any order issued by a court
of this Commonwealth under this section must specify in the
order a period that the court considers adequate to allow the
person seeking an order to obtain an order from the state having
jurisdiction under sections 5421 through 5423. The order issued
in this Commonwealth remains in effect until an order is
obtained from the other state within the period specified or
the period expires.
(d) Mandatory communication between courts.--A court of
this Commonwealth which has been asked to make a child custody
determination under this section, upon being informed that a
child custody proceeding has been commenced in or a child
custody determination has been made by a court of a state having
jurisdiction under sections 5421 through 5423, shall immediately
communicate with the other court. A court of this Commonwealth
which is exercising jurisdiction pursuant to sections 5421
through 5423, upon being informed that a child custody
proceeding has been commenced in or a child custody
determination has been made by a court of another state under
a statute similar to this section, shall immediately communicate
with the court of that state to resolve the emergency, protect
the safety of the parties and the child and determine a period
for the duration of the temporary order.

5205, 5421, 5422, 5423, 5426, 5428, 5450, 5454 of this title.
§ 5425. Notice; opportunity to be heard; joinder.
(a) General rule.--Before a child custody determination is
made under this chapter, notice and an opportunity to be heard
in accordance with the standards of section 5408 (relating to
notice to persons outside Commonwealth) must be given to all
persons entitled to notice under the laws of this Commonwealth
as in child custody proceedings between residents of this
Commonwealth, any parent whose parental rights have not been
previously terminated and any person having physical custody
of the child.
(b) Lack of notice or opportunity to be heard.--This chapter
does not govern the enforceability of a child custody
determination made without notice or any opportunity to be
heard.
(c) Joinder and intervention.--The obligation to join a
party and the right to intervene as a party in a child custody
proceeding under this chapter are governed by the laws of this
Commonwealth as in child custody proceedings between residents
of this Commonwealth.
§ 5426. Simultaneous proceedings.
(a) General rule.--Except as otherwise provided in section
5424 (relating to temporary emergency jurisdiction), a court
of this Commonwealth may not exercise its jurisdiction under
this subchapter if, at the time of the commencement of the
proceeding, a proceeding concerning the custody of the child
has been commenced in a court of another state having
jurisdiction substantially in conformity with this chapter
unless the proceeding has been terminated or is stayed by the
court of the other state because a court of this Commonwealth
is a more convenient forum under section 5427 (relating to
inconvenient forum).
(b) Stay; communication with other court.--Except as
otherwise provided in section 5424, a court of this
Commonwealth, before hearing a child custody proceeding, shall
examine the court documents and other information supplied by
the parties pursuant to section 5429 (relating to information
to be submitted to court). If the court determines that a child
custody proceeding has been commenced in a court in another
state having jurisdiction substantially in accordance with this
chapter, the court of this Commonwealth shall stay its
proceeding and communicate with the court of the other state.
If the court of the state having jurisdiction substantially in
accordance with this chapter does not determine that the court
of this Commonwealth is a more appropriate forum, the court of
this Commonwealth shall dismiss the proceeding.
(c) Modification.--In a proceeding to modify a child custody
determination, a court of this Commonwealth shall determine
whether a proceeding to enforce the determination has been
commenced in another state. If a proceeding to enforce a child
custody determination has been commenced in another state, the
court may:
(1) stay the proceeding for modification pending the
entry of an order of a court of the other state enforcing,
staying, denying or dismissing the proceeding for
enforcement;
(2) enjoin the parties from continuing with the
proceeding for enforcement; or
(3) proceed with the modification under conditions it
considers appropriate.
§ 5427. Inconvenient forum.
(a) General rule.--A court of this Commonwealth which has
jurisdiction under this chapter to make a child custody
determination may decline to exercise its jurisdiction at any
time if it determines that it is an inconvenient forum under
the circumstances and that a court of another state is a more
appropriate forum. The issue of inconvenient forum may be raised
upon motion of a party, the court's own motion or request of
another court.
(b) Factors.--Before determining whether it is an
inconvenient forum, a court of this Commonwealth shall consider
whether it is appropriate for a court of another state to
exercise jurisdiction. For this purpose, the court shall allow
the parties to submit information and shall consider all
relevant factors, including:
(1) whether domestic violence has occurred and is likely
to continue in the future and which state could best protect
the parties and the child;
(2) the length of time the child has resided outside
this Commonwealth;
(3) the distance between the court in this Commonwealth
and the court in the state that would assume jurisdiction;
(4) the relative financial circumstances of the parties;
(5) any agreement of the parties as to which state
should assume jurisdiction;
(6) the nature and location of the evidence required
to resolve the pending litigation, including testimony of
the child;
(7) the ability of the court of each state to decide
the issue expeditiously and the procedures necessary to
present the evidence; and
(8) the familiarity of the court of each state with the
facts and issues in the pending litigation.
(c) Stay.--If a court of this Commonwealth determines that
it is an inconvenient forum and that a court of another state
is a more appropriate forum, it shall stay the proceedings upon
condition that a child custody proceeding be promptly commenced
in another designated state and may impose any other condition
the court considers just and proper.
(d) Jurisdiction declined.--A court of this Commonwealth
may decline to exercise its jurisdiction under this chapter if
a child custody determination is incidental to an action for
divorce or another proceeding while still retaining jurisdiction
over the divorce or other proceeding.
Cross References. Section 5427 is referred to in sections
5421, 5423, 5426, 5428 of this title.
§ 5428. Jurisdiction declined by reason of conduct.
(a) General rule.--Except as otherwise provided in section
5424 (relating to temporary emergency jurisdiction) or by other
laws of this Commonwealth, if a court of this Commonwealth has
jurisdiction under this chapter because a person seeking to
invoke its jurisdiction has engaged in unjustifiable conduct,
the court shall decline to exercise its jurisdiction unless:
(1) the parents and all persons acting as parents have
acquiesced in the exercise of jurisdiction;
(2) a court of the state otherwise having jurisdiction
under sections 5421 (relating to initial child custody
jurisdiction) through 5423 (relating to jurisdiction to
modify determination) determines that this Commonwealth is
a more appropriate forum under section 5427 (relating to
inconvenient forum); or
(3) no court of any other state would have jurisdiction
under the criteria specified in sections 5421 through 5423.
(b) Jurisdiction declined; remedy.--If a court of this
Commonwealth declines to exercise its jurisdiction pursuant to
subsection (a), it may fashion an appropriate remedy to ensure
the safety of the child and prevent a repetition of the
unjustifiable conduct, including staying the proceeding until
a child custody proceeding is commenced in a court having
jurisdiction under sections 5421 through 5423.
(c) Jurisdiction declined; expenses.--If a court dismisses
a petition or stays a proceeding because it declines to exercise
its jurisdiction pursuant to subsection (a), it shall assess
against the party seeking to invoke its jurisdiction necessary
and reasonable expenses, including costs, communication
expenses, attorney fees, investigative fees, expenses for
witnesses, travel expenses and child care during the course of
the proceedings unless the party from whom fees are sought
establishes that the assessment would be clearly inappropriate.
The court may not assess fees, costs or expenses against this
Commonwealth unless authorized by law other than this chapter.

5421 of this title.
§ 5429. Information to be submitted to court.
(a) General rule.--Subject to the rules set forth in Chapter
53 (relating to child custody) providing for the confidentiality
of procedures, addresses and other identifying information in
a child custody proceeding, each party in its first pleading
or in an attached affidavit shall give information, if
reasonably ascertainable, under oath as to the child's present
address or whereabouts, the places where the child has lived
during the last five years and the names and present addresses
of the persons with whom the child has lived during that period.
The pleading or affidavit must state whether the party:

other capacity in any other proceeding concerning the custody
of or visitation with the child and, if so, identify the

current proceeding, including proceedings for enforcement
and proceedings relating to domestic violence, protective
orders, termination of parental rights and adoptions, and,
if so, identify the court, the case number and the nature
of the proceeding; and

party to the proceeding who has physical custody of the child
or claims rights of legal custody or physical custody of or
visitation with the child and, if so, the names and addresses
of those persons.
(b) Stay.--If the information required by subsection (a)
is not furnished, the court upon motion of a party or its own
motion may stay the proceeding until the information is
furnished.

of the items described in subsection (a)(1) through (3) is in
the affirmative, the declarant shall give additional information
under oath as required by the court. The court may examine the
parties under oath as to details of the information furnished
and other matters pertinent to the court's jurisdiction and the
disposition of the case.
(d) Duty to disclose other proceedings.--Each party has a
continuing duty to inform the court of any proceeding in this
Commonwealth or any other state that could affect the current
proceeding.
(e) Identifying information.--If a party alleges in an
affidavit or a pleading under oath that the health, safety or
liberty of a party or child would be jeopardized by disclosure
of identifying information, the information must be sealed and
may not be disclosed to the other party or the public unless
the court orders the disclosure to be made after a hearing in
which the court takes into consideration the health, safety or
liberty of the party or child and determines that the disclosure
is in the interest of justice.

5206, 5426, 5445 of this title.
§ 5430. Appearance of parties and child.

Commonwealth, the court may order a party to the proceeding who
is in this Commonwealth to appear before the court in person
with or without the child. The court may order any person who
is in this Commonwealth and who has physical custody or control
of the child to appear in person with the child.
(b) Party outside this Commonwealth.--If a party to a child
custody proceeding whose presence is desired by the court is
outside this Commonwealth, the court may order that a notice
given pursuant to section 5408 (relating to notice to persons
outside Commonwealth) include a statement directing the party
to appear in person with or without the child and informing the
party that failure to appear may result in a decision adverse
to the party.

necessary to ensure the safety of the child and of any person
ordered to appear under this section.

of the hearing and advise the respondent that at the hearing
the court will order that the petitioner may take immediate
physical custody of the child and the payment of fees, costs
and expenses under section 5452 (relating to costs, fees and

further relief is appropriate unless the respondent appears and
establishes that:
(1) the child custody determination has not been
registered and confirmed under section 5445 and that:

under Subchapter B (relating to jurisdiction);
(ii) the child custody determination for which

modified by a court having jurisdiction to do so under
Subchapter B; or

5451 of this title.
§ 5449. Service of petition and order.
Except as otherwise provided in section 5451 (relating to
warrant to take physical custody of child), the petition and
order must be served by any method authorized by the laws of
this Commonwealth upon respondent and any person who has
physical custody of the child.
§ 5450. Hearing and order.
(a) General rule.--Unless the court issues a temporary
emergency order pursuant to section 5424 (relating to temporary
emergency jurisdiction), upon a finding that a petitioner is
entitled to immediate physical custody of the child, the court
shall order that the petitioner may take immediate physical
custody of the child unless the respondent establishes that:
(1) the child custody determination has not been
registered and confirmed under section 5445 (relating to
registration of child custody determination) and that:
(i) the issuing court did not have jurisdiction
under Subchapter B (relating to jurisdiction);
(ii) the child custody determination for which
enforcement is sought has been vacated, stayed or
modified by a court of a state having jurisdiction to
do so under Subchapter B; or

of section 5408 (relating to notice to persons outside
Commonwealth), in the proceedings before the court that
issued the order for which enforcement is sought; or

enforcement is sought was registered and confirmed under
section 5445 but has been vacated, stayed or modified by a
court of a state having jurisdiction to do so under
Subchapter B.
(b) Costs, fees and expenses.--The court shall award the
costs, fees and expenses authorized under section 5452 (relating
to costs, fees and expenses) and may grant additional relief,
including a request for the assistance of law enforcement
officials, and set a further hearing to determine whether
additional relief is appropriate.
(c) Refusal to testify.--If a party called to testify
refuses to answer on the ground that the testimony may be
self-incriminating, the court may draw an adverse inference
from the refusal.
(d) Spousal privilege unavailable.--A privilege against
disclosure of communications between spouses and a defense of
immunity based on the relationship of husband and wife or parent
and child may not be invoked in a proceeding under this
subchapter.
§ 5451. Warrant to take physical custody of child.
(a) General rule.--Upon the filing of a petition seeking
enforcement of a child custody determination, the petitioner
may file a verified application for the issuance of a warrant
to take physical custody of the child if the child is
immediately likely to suffer serious physical harm or be removed
from this Commonwealth.
(b) Petition.--If the court, upon the testimony of the
petitioner or other witness, finds that the child is imminently
likely to suffer serious physical harm or be removed from this
Commonwealth, it may issue a warrant to take physical custody
of the child. The petition must be heard on the next judicial
day after the warrant is executed unless that date is
impossible. In that event, the court shall hold the hearing on
the first judicial day possible. The application for the warrant
must include the statements required by section 5448(b)
(relating to expedited enforcement of child custody
determination).
(c) Warrant.--A warrant to take physical custody of a child
must:
(1) recite the facts upon which a conclusion of imminent
serious physical harm or removal from the jurisdiction is
based;
(2) direct law enforcement officers to take physical
custody of the child immediately; and
(3) provide for the placement of the child pending final
relief.
(d) Time of service.--The respondent must be served with
the petition, warrant and order immediately after the child is
taken into physical custody.
(e) Enforcement.--A warrant to take physical custody of a
child is enforceable throughout this Commonwealth. If the court
finds on the basis of the testimony of the petitioner or other
witness that a less intrusive remedy is not effective, it may
authorize law enforcement officers to enter private property
to take physical custody of the child. If required by exigent
circumstances of the case, the court may authorize law
enforcement officers to make a forcible entry at any hour.
(f) Appearance of child.--The court may impose conditions
upon placement of a child to ensure the appearance of the child
and the child's custodian.
Cross References. Section 5451 is referred to in section
5449 of this title.
§ 5452. Costs, fees and expenses.

party, including a state, necessary and reasonable expenses
incurred by or on behalf of the party, including costs,
communication expenses, attorney fees, investigative fees,
expenses for witnesses, travel expenses and child care during
the course of the proceedings, unless the party from whom fees
or expenses are sought establishes that the award would be
clearly inappropriate.
(b) Assessment against a state.--The court may not assess
fees, costs or expenses against a state unless authorized by
law other than this chapter.
Cross References. Section 5452 is referred to in sections
5448, 5450 of this title.
§ 5453. Recognition and enforcement.
A court of this Commonwealth shall accord full faith and
credit to an order issued by another state and consistent with
this chapter which enforces a child custody determination by a
court of another state unless the order has been vacated, stayed
or modified by a court having jurisdiction to do so under
Subchapter B (relating to jurisdiction).
§ 5454. Appeals.
An appeal may be taken from a final order in a proceeding
under this subchapter in accordance with expedited appellate
procedures in other civil cases. Unless the court enters a
temporary emergency order under section 5424 (relating to
temporary emergency jurisdiction), the enforcing court may not
stay an order enforcing a child custody determination pending
appeal.
§ 5455. Role of prosecutor or public official.
(a) General rule.--In a case arising under this chapter or
involving the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of
International Child Abduction, the prosecutor or other
appropriate public official may take any lawful action,
including resort to a proceeding under this subchapter or any
other available civil proceeding to locate a child, obtain the
return of a child or enforce a child custody determination if
there is:
(1) an existing child custody determination;
(2) a request to do so from a court in a pending child
custody proceeding;
(3) a reasonable belief that a criminal statute has
been violated; or
(4) a reasonable belief that the child has been
wrongfully removed or retained in violation of the Hague

§ 5611. Designation.
(a) General rule.--A custodial parent, a legal custodian
or legal guardian may designate a standby guardian by means of
a written designation unless the minor has another parent or
adoptive parent:
(1) whose parental rights have not been terminated or
relinquished;
(2) whose whereabouts are known; and
(3) who is willing and able to make and carry out the
day-to-day child-care decisions concerning the minor.
(b) Exception where other parent consents.--Notwithstanding
subsection (a), a parent, legal custodian or legal guardian may
designate a standby guardian with the consent of the other
parent.
(c) Contents.--
(1) A designation of a standby guardianship shall
identify the custodial parent, legal custodian or legal
guardian making the designation, the minor or minors, any
other parent, the standby guardian and the triggering event
or events upon which a named standby guardian shall become
a coguardian or guardian. If desired, different standby
guardians may be designated for different triggering events.
The designation shall also include the signed consent of the
standby guardian and the signed consent of any other parent
or an indication why the other parent's consent is not
necessary.
(2) The designation shall be signed by the designating
parent, legal custodian or legal guardian in the presence
of two witnesses who are 18 years of age or older and not
otherwise named in the designation, who shall also sign the
designation. If the parent, legal custodian or legal guardian
is physically unable to sign the designation, the parent,
legal custodian or legal guardian may direct another person
not named in the designation to sign on the parent's, the
legal custodian's or the legal guardian's behalf in the
presence of the parent, legal custodian or legal guardian
and the witnesses.
(3) A parent, legal custodian or legal guardian may
also but need not designate an alternate in the designation.
(4) A designation may but need not be in the following
form:
I (insert name of designator) do hereby appoint
(insert name, address and telephone number of standby
guardian) as the standby guardian of (insert name(s) of
minor(s)) to take effect upon the occurrence of the
following triggering event or events (insert specific
triggering events).
I hereby revoke all former wills and codicils to the
extent that there is a conflict between those formerly
executed documents and this, my duly executed standby
guardian designation.
I am the (insert designator's relationship to
minor(s)) of (insert name(s) of minor(s)).
(Insert name(s) of minor(s)'s other parent(s)) is
the father/mother of (insert name(s) of minor(s)).
His/her address is:
(Check all that apply):
He/she died on (insert date of death).
His/her parental rights were terminated or
relinquished on (insert date of termination or
relinquishment).
His/her whereabouts are unknown. I understand that
all living parents whose rights have not been
terminated must be given notice of this designation
pursuant to the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil
Procedure or a petition to approve this designation
may not be granted by the court.
He/she is unwilling and unable to make and carry
out day-to-day child-care decisions concerning the
minor.
He/she consents to this designation and has signed
this form below.
By this designation I am granting (insert name of
standby guardian) the authority to act for 60 days
following the occurrence of the triggering event as a
coguardian with me or, in the event of my death, as
guardian of my minor child(ren).
Optional: I hereby nominate (insert name, address
and telephone number of alternate standby guardian) as
the alternate standby guardian to assume the duties of
the standby guardian named above in the event the standby
guardian is unable or refuses to act as a standby
guardian.
If I have indicated more than one triggering event,
it is my intent that the triggering event which occurs
first shall take precedence. If I have indicated "my
death" as the triggering event, it is my intent that the
person named in the designation to be standby guardian
for my minor child(ren) in the event of my death shall
be appointed as guardian of my minor child(ren) when I
die.
It is my intention to retain full parental rights
to the extent consistent with my condition and to retain
the authority to revoke the standby guardianship if I
so choose.
This designation is made after careful reflection,
while I am of sound mind.

§ 5612. Petition for approval of a designation.
(a) General rule.--A petition for court approval of a
designation under this chapter may be made at any time by filing
with the court a copy of the designation. If the triggering
event has not occurred on or before the time of filing, only
the designator may file the petition. If the triggering event
has occurred on or before the time of filing, the standby
guardian named in the designation may file the petition, and
the petition shall also contain one of the following:
(1) A determination of the designator's incapacity.
(2) A determination of the designator's debilitation
and the designator's signed and dated consent.
(3) A copy of the designator's death certificate.
(b) Notice.--
(1) The petitioner shall notify any person named in the
designation within ten days of the filing of the petition
and of any hearing thereon.
(2) If the petition alleges that a nondesignating parent
cannot be located, that parent shall be notified in
accordance with the notice provisions of the Pennsylvania
Rules of Civil Procedure in Custody Matters. No notice is
necessary to a parent whose parental rights have previously
been terminated or relinquished.
(c) Jurisdiction.--For purposes of determining jurisdiction
under this chapter, the provisions of Chapter 54 (relating to
uniform child custody jurisdiction and enforcement) shall apply.
(d) Presumptions.--In a proceeding for judicial appointment
of a standby guardian, a designation shall constitute a
rebuttable presumption that the designated standby guardian is
capable of serving as coguardian or guardian. When the
designator is the sole surviving parent, when the parental
rights of any noncustodial parent have been terminated or
relinquished or when all parties consent to the designation,
there shall be a rebuttable presumption that entry of the
approval order is in the best interest of the child. In any
case, if the court finds entry of the approval order to be in
the best interest of the child, the court shall enter an order
approving the designation petition.
(e) Approval without hearing.--Approval of the designation
without a hearing is permitted when the designator is the sole
surviving parent, when the parental rights of any noncustodial
parent have been terminated or relinquished or when all parties
consent to entry of the approval order.
(f) Hearing.--In the event a hearing is required, it shall
be conducted in accordance with the proceedings set forth in
Chapters 53 (relating to custody) and 54.
(g) Court appearance.--The designator need not appear in
court if the designator is medically unable to appear.

Cross References. Section 5612 is referred to in sections
5613, 5614 of this title.
§ 5613. Authority of standby guardian.
(a) General rule.--The standby guardian shall have authority
to act as coguardian or guardian upon the occurrence of the
triggering event. The commencement of the standby guardian's
authority to act as coguardian pursuant to a determination of
incapacity, a determination of debilitation and consent or the
receipt of consent alone shall not itself divest the designator
of any parental rights but shall confer upon the standby
guardian concurrent or shared custody of the child. The
commencement of the standby guardian's authority to act as
guardian pursuant to the death of the designator shall not
confer upon the standby guardian more than physical and legal
custody of the child as defined in Chapter 53 (relating to
custody). A coguardian shall assure frequent and continuing
contact with and physical access to the child and shall further
assure the involvement of the parent, to include, to the
greatest extent possible, in the decision making on behalf of
the child.
(b) Effect of filing.--The designator may file a petition
for approval of a designation with the court at any time. If
the petition is approved by the court before the occurrence of
the triggering event, the standby guardian's authority will
commence automatically upon the occurrence of the triggering
event. No further petition or confirmation is necessary. If a
designation has been made but the petition for approval of the
designation has not been filed and a triggering event has
occurred, the standby guardian shall have temporary legal
authority to act as a coguardian or guardian of the minor
without the direction of the court for a period of 60 days. The
standby guardian shall within that period file a petition for
approval in accordance with section 5612 (relating to petition
for approval of a designation). If no petition is filed within
the specified 60 days, the standby guardian shall lose all
authority to act as coguardian or guardian. If a petition is
filed but the court does not act upon it within the 60-day
period, the temporary legal authority to act as coguardian or
guardian shall continue until the court orders otherwise.
(c) Parental rights.--The commencement of a coguardian's
or guardian's authority under this subchapter may not itself
divest a parent or legal guardian of any parental or
guardianship rights.
(d) Restored capacity.--If a licensed physician determines
that the designator has regained capacity, the coguardian's
authority which commenced pursuant to the occurrence of a
triggering event shall become inactive, and the coguardian shall
return to having no authority. Failure of a coguardian to comply
with this provision and to immediately return the minor to the
designator's care shall entitle the designator to an emergency
hearing in a court of competent jurisdiction.
References in Text. Former Chapter 53 (Custody), referred
to in this section, is repealed. The subject matter is now
contained in Chapter 53 (Child Custody).
§ 5614. Revocation.
(a) Prepetition.--Prior to a petition being filed under
section 5612 (relating to petition for approval of a
designation), the designator may revoke a standby guardianship
by simple destruction of the designation and notification of
the revocation to the standby guardian.
(b) Postpetition.--After a petition has been filed, the
designator may revoke a standby guardianship by:
(1) executing a written revocation;
(2) filing the revocation with the court; and
(3) notifying the persons named in the designation of
the revocation in writing.
(c) Unwritten revocation.--Regardless of whether a petition
has been filed, an unwritten revocation may be considered by
the court if it can be proven by clear and convincing evidence.
§ 5615. Conflicting documents.
If a parent has appointed a testamentary guardian of the
person or estate of a minor by will under 20 Pa.C.S. § 2519
(relating to testamentary guardian) and there is a conflict
between that will and a duly executed written standby guardian
designation, the document latest in date of execution shall
prevail.
§ 5616. Bond.
In no event shall a standby guardian be required to post
bond prior to the occurrence of the triggering event. The court
may require a bond if the standby guardian is designated the
coguardian or guardian of the estate of a minor but will not
require a bond for the coguardianship or guardianship of the
person of a minor.

with the court a copy of the designation.
(b) Exception where designation has not been entered.--If
a custodial parent has been subject to emergency medical
intervention due to abuse of drugs or alcohol and a written
designation has not been executed, a family member shall
petition the court to hold a hearing to be designated temporary
guardian. The petition, which shall require the notarized
signature of the petitioner, shall be provided by the court in
the following form:

GUARDIAN OF ...................................................

I HAVE NOTIFIED THE CHILD(REN)'S OTHER PARENT,.............
................................................................
(Insert Name, Address and Telephone Number), OF MY INTENT TO
PETITION THIS COURT FOR TEMPORARY GUARDIANSHIP.
I UNDERSTAND THAT FILING THIS PETITION DOES NOT REVOKE THE
PARENTAL RIGHTS OF THE MINOR'S PARENT(S) NOR DOES IT GRANT ME
ANY PARENTAL RIGHTS.
I UNDERSTAND THAT MY RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES AS A
TEMPORARY GUARDIAN TOWARD THE MINOR CHILD(REN) NAMED ABOVE WILL
BECOME EFFECTIVE UPON THE COMPLETION OF A HEARING AND RENDERING
OF A DECISION BY THE COURT.
I UNDERSTAND THAT FILING FEES AND OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED
WITH THESE PROCEEDINGS MAY BE WAIVED IF I DEMONSTRATE THE FEES
AND OTHER COSTS WOULD CONSTITUTE A FINANCIAL BURDEN TO ME AND
MY FAMILY.
I HEREBY SWEAR OR AFFIRM THAT THE INFORMATION CONTAINED
HEREIN IS TRUE AND CORRECT TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE.
.............................. .................................
(DATE) (SIGNATURE OF PETITIONER)
(c) Notice.--
(1) The court shall notify a person named in the
designation within 10 days of the filing of the petition and
of any hearing on the petition.
(2) If a designation has not been executed, the
petitioner shall notify the custodial parent or parents,
noncustodial parent or adoptive parent within 10 days of the
filing of the petition and of any hearing on the petition.
(3) If the petition alleges that a noncustodial parent
cannot be located, that parent shall be notified in
accordance with the notice provisions of the Pennsylvania
Rules of Civil Procedure in custody matters. No notice is
necessary to a parent whose parental rights have previously
been terminated or relinquished.
(d) Jurisdiction.--For purposes of determining jurisdiction
under this chapter, the provisions of Chapter 54 (relating to
uniform child custody jurisdiction and enforcement) shall apply.
(e) Presumptions.--In a proceeding for judicial appointment
of a temporary guardian, a designation shall constitute a
rebuttable presumption that the designated temporary guardian
is capable of serving as coguardian or guardian. When the
designator is the sole surviving parent and when the parental
rights of any noncustodial parent have been terminated or
relinquished or when all parties consent to the designation,
there shall be a rebuttable presumption that entry of the
approval order is in the best interest of the child. In any
case, if the court finds entry of the approval order to be in
the best interests of the child, the court shall enter an order
approving the designation petition.
(f) Approval without hearing.--Approval of the designation
without a hearing is permitted when the designator is the sole
surviving parent, when the parental rights of a noncustodial
parent have been terminated or relinquished or when all parties
consent to entry of the approval order.
(g) Hearing.--If a hearing is required, it shall be
conducted in accordance with the proceedings under Chapters 53
(relating to child custody) and 54.
(h) Court appearance.--If a designation has not been
executed and a petition for temporary guardianship has been
filed with the court by a family member, the custodial parent
and noncustodial parent or adoptive parent shall appear in court
in order to consent to or oppose the designation. If notice has
been given under subsection (c)(3) and a noncustodial parent
does not appear in court, it is presumed that consent to the
designation has been granted.
(i) Costs.--A court may waive filing fees and other costs
upon application when the petitioner demonstrates the fees and
other costs would constitute a financial burden upon the
petitioner and the petitioner's family. There shall be a
presumption of a financial burden if the income from all sources
of the petitioner is less than 300% of the poverty level set
by the Federal Government.
Cross References. Section 5622 is referred to in section
5623 of this title.
§ 5623. Authority of temporary guardian.
(a) Authority.--

act as coguardian or guardian upon a custodial parent
entering into an alcohol or drug treatment facility or upon
a court ordering the designation pursuant to hearing under
subsection 5622(b) (relating to petition for approval of
designation).
(2) The commencement of the temporary guardian's
authority to act as coguardian shall not itself divest the
custodial parent of parental rights but shall confer upon
the temporary guardian concurrent or shared custody of the
child.
(3) A coguardian shall assure frequent and continuing
contact with and physical access to the child and shall
further assure the involvement of the custodial parent, to
the greatest extent possible, in the decision making on
behalf of the child.
(4) The commencement of a temporary guardian's authority
under this subchapter shall not itself divest a parent or
legal guardian of parental or guardianship rights.
(b) Limitations on authority.--In addition to any other
restrictions placed on a temporary guardian by the court, the
temporary guardian may not:
(1) remove the minor or permit the minor to be removed
from the United States either permanently or temporarily
without the consent of the custodial parent and the approval
of the court; or
(2) remove the minor from this Commonwealth absent a
court order, which may only be issued after a hearing at
which both parents and the minor shall have the right to be
present.
§ 5624. Period of temporary guardianship.
(a) Initial period.--Temporary guardianship under this
subchapter shall be limited to not more than 90 days from entry
of the order of temporary guardianship.
(b) Extension of guardianship.--Upon approval by the court
or by written agreement of the temporary guardian and the parent
who has entered a rehabilitation facility, temporary
guardianship shall be extended for periods of up to 90
additional days.
(c) Total period.--The total period of guardianship under
this section shall not exceed 365 days.
§ 5625. Termination of temporary guardianship.
(a) Conditions.--A court shall terminate a temporary
guardianship if any of the following exists:
(1) The custodial parent demonstrates the basis for the
temporary guardianship no longer exists.
(2) The custodial parent and temporary guardian agree
upon termination.
(3) The temporary guardian files a petition with the
court seeking termination.
(4) Subject to subsection (b), a noncustodial or
adoptive parent files a petition with the court seeking
termination of the guardianship.
(5) The temporary guardian or an individual who resides
with the temporary guardian commits an offense that results
in the temporary guardian or an individual who resides with
the temporary guardian being identified as a perpetrator as
defined in section 6303 (relating to definitions).

for temporary guardianship under subsection (a)(4), the court

rights were previously terminated.

written pleading was filed seeking the protection order; or
(2) a cross or counter petition, complaint or other
written pleading was filed and the court did not make a
specific finding that each party was entitled to a protection
order.

file a certified copy of a foreign protection order with the
prothonotary in any county within this Commonwealth where the
plaintiff believes enforcement may be necessary. The following

be considered in any subsequent proceedings under this title.
This notice shall be printed and delivered in a manner which
easily attracts attention to its content and shall specify that
child custody is one of the proceedings where prior protection
orders may be considered.

protection from abuse and alleges immediate and present
danger of abuse to the plaintiff or minor children, the court
shall conduct an ex parte proceeding.

when it finds they are in immediate and present danger of
abuse. The order shall remain in effect until modified or

firearms, other weapons or ammunition for the duration of
the temporary order if the petition demonstrates any of the
following:

from abuse is not likely to achieve its purpose in
the absence of such a condition.

violated a protection from abuse order.

weapon or ammunition listed in the order. Relinquishment may
be to the sheriff pursuant to section 6108(a)(7) or to a
third party for safekeeping pursuant to section 6108.3
(relating to relinquishment to third party for safekeeping).

temporary orders under subsection (b) as it deems necessary.
(2) If a hearing is scheduled to take place within three
business days after a defendant is served under section 6106
(relating to commencement of proceedings), the court shall
grant a continuance until the three-business-day period has
elapsed, if requested by the defendant.
(3) The court shall notify the defendant of the right
to such continuance.

§ 6108. Relief.
(a) General rule.--Subject to subsection (a.1), the court
may grant any protection order or approve any consent agreement
to bring about a cessation of abuse of the plaintiff or minor
children. The order or agreement may include:
(1) Directing the defendant to refrain from abusing the
plaintiff or minor children.
(2) Granting possession to the plaintiff of the
residence or household to the exclusion of the defendant by
evicting the defendant or restoring possession to the
plaintiff if the residence or household is jointly owned or
leased by the parties, is owned or leased by the entireties
or is owned or leased solely by the plaintiff.
(3) If the defendant has a duty to support the plaintiff
or minor children living in the residence or household and
the defendant is the sole owner or lessee, granting
possession to the plaintiff of the residence or household
to the exclusion of the defendant by evicting the defendant
or restoring possession to the plaintiff or, with the consent
of the plaintiff, ordering the defendant to provide suitable
alternate housing.
(4) Awarding temporary custody of or establishing
temporary visitation rights with regard to minor children.
In determining whether to award temporary custody or
establish temporary visitation rights pursuant to this
paragraph, the court shall consider any risk posed by the
defendant to the children as well as risk to the plaintiff.
The following shall apply:
(i) A defendant shall not be granted custody,
partial custody or unsupervised visitation where it is
alleged in the petition, and the court finds after a
hearing under this chapter, that the defendant:
(A) abused the minor children of the parties or
poses a risk of abuse toward the minor children of
the parties; or
(B) has been convicted of violating 18 Pa.C.S.
§ 2904 (relating to interference with custody of
children) within two calendar years prior to the
filing of the petition for protection order or that
the defendant poses a risk of violating 18 Pa.C.S.
§ 2904.
(ii) Where the court finds after a hearing under
this chapter that the defendant has inflicted abuse upon
the plaintiff or a child, the court may require
supervised custodial access by a third party. The third
party must agree to be accountable to the court for
supervision and execute an affidavit of accountability.
(iii) Where the court finds after a hearing under
this chapter that the defendant has inflicted serious
abuse upon the plaintiff or a child or poses a risk of
abuse toward the plaintiff or a child, the court may:
(A) award supervised visitation in a secure
visitation facility; or
(B) deny the defendant custodial access to a
child.
(iv) If a plaintiff petitions for a temporary order
under section 6107(b) (relating to hearings) and the
defendant has partial, shared or full custody of the
minor children of the parties by order of court or
written agreement of the parties, the custody shall not
be disturbed or changed unless the court finds that the
defendant is likely to inflict abuse upon the children
or to remove the children from the jurisdiction of the
court prior to the hearing under section 6107(a). Where
the defendant has forcibly or fraudulently removed any
minor child from the care and custody of a plaintiff,
the court shall order the return of the child to the
plaintiff unless the child would be endangered by
restoration to the plaintiff.
(v) Nothing in this paragraph shall bar either party
from filing a petition for custody under Chapter 53
(relating to custody) or under the Pennsylvania Rules
of Civil Procedure.
(vi) In order to prevent further abuse during
periods of access to the plaintiff and child during the
exercise of custodial rights, the court shall consider,
and may impose on a custody award, conditions necessary
to assure the safety of the plaintiff and minor children
from abuse.
(5) After a hearing in accordance with section 6107(a),
directing the defendant to pay financial support to those
persons the defendant has a duty to support, requiring the

the minor child and spouse, directing the defendant to pay
all of the unreimbursed medical expenses of a spouse or minor
child of the defendant to the provider or to the plaintiff
when he or she has paid for the medical treatment, and
directing the defendant to make or continue to make rent or
mortgage payments on the residence of the plaintiff to the
extent that the defendant has a duty to support the plaintiff
or other dependent household members. The support order shall
be temporary, and any beneficiary of the order must file a
complaint for support under the provisions of Chapters 43
(relating to support matters generally) and 45 (relating to
reciprocal enforcement of support orders) within two weeks
of the date of the issuance of the protection order. If a
complaint for support is not filed, that portion of the
protection order requiring the defendant to pay support is
void. When there is a subsequent ruling on a complaint for
support, the portion of the protection order requiring the
defendant to pay support expires.
(6) Prohibiting the defendant from having any contact
with the plaintiff or minor children, including, but not
limited to, restraining the defendant from entering the place
of employment or business or school of the plaintiff or minor
children and from harassing the plaintiff or plaintiff's

possessing any firearm for the duration of the order,

§ 6304. Exclusions from child abuse.
(a) Environmental factors.--No child shall be deemed to be
physically or mentally abused based on injuries that result
solely from environmental factors, such as inadequate housing,
furnishings, income, clothing and medical care, that are beyond
the control of the parent or person responsible for the child's
welfare with whom the child resides. This subsection shall not
apply to any child-care service as defined in this chapter,
excluding an adoptive parent.
(b) Practice of religious beliefs.--If, upon investigation,
the county agency determines that a child has not been provided
needed medical or surgical care because of sincerely held
religious beliefs of the child's parents or relative within the
third degree of consanguinity and with whom the child resides,
which beliefs are consistent with those of a bona fide religion,
the child shall not be deemed to be physically or mentally
abused. In such cases the following shall apply:
(1) The county agency shall closely monitor the child
and the child's family and shall seek court-ordered medical
intervention when the lack of medical or surgical care
threatens the child's life or long-term health.
(2) All correspondence with a subject of the report and
the records of the department and the county agency shall
not reference child abuse and shall acknowledge the religious
basis for the child's condition.
(3) The family shall be referred for general protective
services, if appropriate.
(4) This subsection shall not apply if the failure to
provide needed medical or surgical care causes the death of
the child.
(5) This subsection shall not apply to any child-care
service as defined in this chapter, excluding an adoptive
parent.
(c) Use of force for supervision, control and safety
purposes.--Subject to subsection (d), the use of reasonable
force on or against a child by the child's own parent or person
responsible for the child's welfare shall not be considered
child abuse if any of the following conditions apply:
(1) The use of reasonable force constitutes incidental,
minor or reasonable physical contact with the child or other
actions that are designed to maintain order and control.
(2) The use of reasonable force is necessary:
(i) to quell a disturbance or remove the child from
the scene of a disturbance that threatens physical injury
to persons or damage to property;
(ii) to prevent the child from self-inflicted
physical harm;
(iii) for self-defense or the defense of another
individual; or
(iv) to obtain possession of weapons or other
dangerous objects or controlled substances or
paraphernalia that are on the child or within the control
of the child.
(d) Rights of parents.--Nothing in this chapter shall be
construed to restrict the generally recognized existing rights
of parents to use reasonable force on or against their children
for the purposes of supervision, control and discipline of their
children. Such reasonable force shall not constitute child
abuse.
(e) Participation in events that involve physical contact
with child.--An individual participating in a practice or
competition in an interscholastic sport, physical education, a
recreational activity or an extracurricular activity that
involves physical contact with a child does not, in itself,
constitute contact that is subject to the reporting requirements
of this chapter.
(f) Child-on-child contact.--
(1) Harm or injury to a child that results from the act
of another child shall not constitute child abuse unless the
child who caused the harm or injury is a perpetrator.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the following shall
apply:

against a child shall be subject to the reporting
requirements of this chapter:
(A) rape as defined in 18 Pa.C.S. § 3121

(ii) No child shall be deemed to be a perpetrator
of child abuse based solely on physical or mental
injuries caused to another child in the course of a
dispute, fight or scuffle entered into by mutual consent.
(iii) A law enforcement official who receives a
report of suspected child abuse is not required to make
a report to the department under section 6334(a)
(relating to disposition of complaints received), if the
person allegedly responsible for the child abuse is a
nonperpetrator child.
(g) Defensive force.--Reasonable force for self-defense or
the defense of another individual, consistent with the
provisions of 18 Pa.C.S. §§ 505 (relating to use of force in
self-protection) and 506 (relating to use of force for the

child abuse that also alleges that a criminal offense has been
committed against the child, the department shall immediately
transmit an oral notice or notice by electronic technologies
to the appropriate law enforcement official in the county where

received does not suggest a need for protective services but
does suggest a need for social services or other services or

services and the report of suspected child abuse is clearly
identified as an unfounded report. The county agency shall
notify the department immediately upon closure of the case, and
the report shall be expunged as soon as possible, but no later
than 120 days after the one-year period following the date the

as possible, but no later than 120 days after the ten-year
period following the closure of services by the county agency

the date the report was received by the department. The
expunction shall be mandated and guaranteed by the department.

protective services reports shall be maintained by a county
agency as follows:

be used and maintained in a manner that is consistent with
the use and maintenance of information in the Statewide
database, as provided under this chapter, except as otherwise
provided in paragraph (2). If required under this chapter
to amend or expunge information in the Statewide database,

of the amendment or expungement within ten days. The county
agency shall amend or expunge its records in a commensurate
manner within ten days of receiving notification from the

(2) Any person named as a perpetrator, and any school
employee named, in an indicated report of child abuse may,
within 90 days of being notified of the status of the report,

in their records so that the records are consistent at both the
State and local levels.
(c) Review of refusal of request.--Subject to subsection
(c.1), if the secretary refuses a request under subsection
(a)(1) or a request for administrative review under subsection
(a)(2), or does not act within the prescribed time, the

and request a hearing before the secretary to amend or expunge
an indicated report on the grounds that it is inaccurate or it
is being maintained in a manner inconsistent with this chapter.
The request for hearing must be made within 90 days of notice
of the decision. The appropriate county agency and appropriate
law enforcement officials shall be given notice of the hearing.
The burden of proof in the hearing shall be on the appropriate

a founded report of child abuse must provide to the department
a court order indicating that the underlying adjudication that
formed the basis of the founded report has been reversed or
vacated.
(c.2) Hearing.--A person making an appeal under subsection
(a)(2) or (c) shall have the right to a timely hearing to

scheduling order is entered, unless all parties have agreed
to a continuance. Proceedings and hearings shall be scheduled
to be heard on consecutive days whenever possible, but if
not on consecutive days, then the proceeding or hearing shall
be concluded not later than 30 days from commencement.

burden of proving by substantial evidence that the report
should remain categorized as an indicated report.
(c.3) Prompt decision.--The administrative law judge's or
hearing officer's decision in a hearing under subsection (c.2)
shall be entered, filed and served upon the parties within 45
days of the date upon which the proceeding or hearing is
concluded unless, within that time, the tribunal extends the
date for the decision by order entered of record showing good
cause for the extension. In no event shall an extension delay
the entry of the decision more than 60 days after the conclusion
of the proceeding or hearing.
(c.4) Notice of decision.--Notice of the decision shall be
made to the Statewide database, the appropriate county agency,
any appropriate law enforcement officials and all subjects of
the report, except for the abused child.
(d) Stay of proceedings.--Any administrative appeal
proceeding pursuant to subsection (b) shall be automatically
stayed upon notice to the department by either of the parties
when there is a pending criminal proceeding or a dependency or
delinquency proceeding pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. Ch. 63 (relating
to juvenile matters), including any appeal thereof, involving
the same factual circumstances as the administrative appeal.
(e) Order.--The secretary or designated agent may make any
appropriate order respecting the amendment or expunction of
such records to make them accurate or consistent with the
requirements of this chapter.
(f) Notice of expunction.--Written notice of an expunction
of any child abuse record made pursuant to the provisions of
this chapter shall be served upon the subject of the record who
was responsible for the abuse or injury and the appropriate
county agency. Except as provided in this subsection, the county
agency, upon receipt of the notice, shall take appropriate,
similar action in regard to the local child abuse records and
inform, for the same purpose, the appropriate coroner if that
officer has received reports pursuant to section 6367 (relating
to reports to department and coroner). Whenever the county
agency investigation reveals, within 60 days of receipt of the
report of suspected child abuse, that the report is unfounded
but that the subjects need services provided or arranged by the
county agency, the county agency shall retain those records and
shall specifically identify that the report was an unfounded
report of suspected child abuse. An unfounded report regarding
subjects who receive services shall be expunged no later than
120 days following the expiration of one year after the
termination or completion of services provided or arranged by
the county agency.
(g) Reconsideration and appeal.--Parties to a proceeding
or hearing held under subsection (c.2) have 15 calendar days
from the mailing date of the final order of the Bureau of
Hearings and Appeals to request the secretary to reconsider the

section have 30 calendar days from the mailing date of the final
order of the Bureau of Hearings and Appeals to perfect an appeal
to Commonwealth Court. The filing for reconsideration shall not
toll the 30 days provided.

§ 6361. Organization for child protective services.
(a) Establishment.--Every county agency shall make available
child protective services within the agency. The department may
waive the requirement that a county agency be the sole civil
agency for receipt and investigation of reports pursuant to
section 6362 (relating to responsibilities of county agency for
child protective services) upon a showing by the county that:
(1) It is participating in a demonstration project for
or has become part of an approved combined intake system for
public human service agencies as permitted by department
regulations. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to permit
noncounty government agencies to participate in the receipt
and investigation of the reports.
(2) The goals and objectives of this chapter will
continue to be met if a waiver is granted.
If the department grants a waiver under this subsection, the
county agency and its agents shall be bound by all other
provisions of this chapter, including requirements concerning
the maintenance and disclosure of confidential information and
records.
(b) Staff and organization.--The county agency shall have
a sufficient staff of sufficient qualifications to fulfill the
purposes of this chapter and be organized in a way to maximize
the continuity of responsibility, care and services of
individual workers toward individual children and families. The
department, by regulation, shall set forth staff-to-family
ratios for the various activities required of the county agency
under this chapter, including reports and investigations of
suspected child abuse, risk assessment and the provision or
monitoring of services to abused children and their families.
(c) Functions authorized.--The county agency staff shall
perform those functions assigned to it by this chapter and such
other functions as would further the purposes of this chapter.

§ 6362. Responsibilities of county agency for child protective
services.
(a) General rule.--The county agency shall be the sole civil
agency responsible for receiving and investigating all reports
of child abuse made pursuant to this chapter, specifically
including, but not limited to, reports of child abuse in
facilities operated by the department and other public agencies,
for the purpose of providing protective services to prevent
further abuses to children and to provide or arrange for and
monitor the provision of those services necessary to safeguard
and ensure the well-being and development of the child and to
preserve and stabilize family life wherever appropriate.
(b) Assumption of responsibility by department.--When the
suspected abuse has been committed by the county agency or any
of its agents or employees, the department shall assume the
role of the agency with regard to the investigation and directly
refer the child for services.
(c) Action by agencies for abuse by agents or
employees.--Where suspected child abuse has occurred and an
employee or agent of the department or the county agency or a
private or public institution is a subject of the report, the
department, agency or institution shall be informed of the
investigation so that it may take appropriate action.
(d) Reliance on factual investigation.--An agency charged
by this section or section 6361 (relating to organization for
child protective services) with investigating a report of child
abuse may rely on a factual investigation of substantially the
same allegations by a law enforcement agency to support the
agency's finding. This reliance shall not, however, limit the
duties imposed by section 6368(a) (relating to investigation
of reports).
(e) Risk assessment.--Each county agency shall implement a
State-approved risk assessment process in performance of its
duties under this subchapter.
(f) Weekly face-to-face contacts.--For those children
assessed as being at high risk for abuse or neglect who are
remaining in or returning to the home in which the abuse or
neglect occurred, the county agency shall ensure that those
children are seen at least once a week, either directly by a
county agency worker or through purchase of service, until they
are no longer assessed as being at high risk for abuse or
neglect.

the court proceeding in accordance with the purposes of this
chapter.

status of the report from an indicated report to an
unfounded report. Upon notice, the department shall be
responsible for expunging the indicated report consistent
with the expunction requirements of this chapter.

custodian or guardian. Where the county agency finds that the
placement for any temporary or permanent custody, care or
treatment is for any reason inappropriate or harmful in any way
to the physical or mental well-being of the child, it shall
take immediate steps to remedy these conditions including
petitioning the court.

necessary for the adjudication of dependency of a child pursuant
to 42 Pa.C.S. Ch. 63 (relating to juvenile matters).

the court during all stages of a court proceeding in accordance
with the purposes of this chapter.
(m) Weekly face-to-face contacts.--For those children
assessed under this section as being at high risk for abuse or

(a) Single child support order.--If a proceeding is brought
under this part and only one tribunal has issued a child support
order, the order of that tribunal controls and must be so
recognized.
(a.1) Multiple orders.--If a proceeding is brought under
this part and two or more child support orders have been issued
by tribunals of this State, another state or a foreign country
with regard to the same obligor and same child, a tribunal of
this State having personal jurisdiction over both the obligor
and the individual obligee shall apply the following rules and
by order shall determine which order controls and must be
recognized:
(1) If only one of the tribunals would have continuing,
exclusive jurisdiction under this part, the order of that
tribunal controls.
(2) If more than one of the tribunals would have
continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this part, an order
issued by a tribunal in the current home state of the child
controls and must be so recognized, but, if an order has not
been issued in the current home state of the child, the order
most recently issued controls and must be so recognized.
(3) If none of the tribunals would have continuing,
exclusive jurisdiction under this part, the tribunal of this
State shall issue a child support order, which controls.
(a.2) Request to determine controlling order.--If two or
more child support orders have been issued for the same obligor
and the same child, upon request of a party who is an individual
or which is a support enforcement agency, a tribunal of this
State having personal jurisdiction over both the obligor and
the obligee who is an individual shall determine which order
controls under subsection (a.1). The request may be filed with
a registration for enforcement or registration for modification
under Chapter 76 (relating to registration, enforcement and
modification of support order) or may be filed as a separate
proceeding. The request to determine which is the controlling
order must be accompanied by a copy of every child support order
in effect and the applicable record of payments. The requesting
party shall give notice of the request to each party whose
rights may be affected by the determination.
(b) Exclusive jurisdiction.--The tribunal that issued the
controlling order under subsection (a), (a.1) or (a.2) is the
tribunal that has continuing jurisdiction under section 7205
(relating to continuing, exclusive jurisdiction to modify child
support orders) or 7206 (relating to continuing jurisdiction
to enforce child support orders).
(c) Basis of order.--A tribunal of this State which
determines by order the identity of the controlling order under
subsection (a.1)(1) or (2) or (a.2) or which issues a new
controlling order under subsection (a.1)(3) shall state all of
the following in that order:
(1) The basis upon which the tribunal made its
determination.
(2) The amount of prospective support, if any.
(3) The total amount of consolidated arrears and accrued
interest, if any, under all of the orders after all payments
made are credited under section 7209 (relating to credit for
payments).
(d) Filing of copy of order.--Within 30 days after issuance
of an order determining the identity of the controlling order,
the party obtaining the determining order shall file a certified
copy of it with each tribunal that issued or registered an
earlier order of child support. A party or support enforcement
agency that obtains a determining order and fails to file a
certified copy is subject to appropriate sanctions by a tribunal
in which the issue of failure to file arises. Failure to file
a copy of the determining order does not affect the validity
or enforceability of the controlling order.
(e) Recognition.--An order which has been determined to be
the controlling order or a judgment for consolidated arrears
of support and interest, if any, made under this section must
be recognized in proceedings under this part.

name. Payment of support owed to the obligee has priority over
fees, costs and expenses.

determining parentage of a child.

substantially complying with federally mandated forms, and a
document incorporated by reference in any of them, not excluded
under the hearsay rule if given in person, are admissible in
evidence if given under penalty of perjury by a party or witness
residing outside this State.

payments certified as a true copy of the original by the
custodian of the record may be forwarded to a responding
tribunal. The copy is evidence of facts asserted in it and is
admissible to show whether payments were made.
(d) Bills.--Copies of bills for testing for parentage of a
child and for prenatal and postnatal health care of the mother
and child, furnished to the adverse party at least ten days
before trial, are admissible in evidence to prove the amount

civil hearing refuses to answer on the ground that the testimony

inference from the refusal.

of communications between spouses does not apply in a proceeding
under this part.

relationship of husband and wife or parent and child does not
apply in a proceeding under this part.

certified as a true copy, is admissible to establish parentage
of the child.

Subchapter Heading. The heading of Subchapter C was amended
December 28, 2015, P.L.559, No.94, effective immediately.
§ 7609. Procedure to register child support order of another
state for modification.
A party or support enforcement agency seeking to modify or
to modify and enforce a child support order issued in another
state must register that order in this State in the same manner
provided in Subchapter A (relating to registration for
enforcement of support order) or B (relating to contest of
validity or enforcement) if the order has not been registered.
A petition for modification may be filed at the same time as a
request for registration or later. The pleading must specify
the grounds for modification.
(Dec. 28, 2015, P.L.559, No.94, eff. imd.)
§ 7610. Effect of registration for modification.
A tribunal of this State may enforce a child support order
of another state registered for purposes of modification in the
same manner as if the order had been issued by a tribunal of
this State, but the registered support order may be modified
only if the requirements of section 7611 (relating to
modification of child support order of another state) or 7613
(relating to jurisdiction to modify child support order of
another state when individual parties reside in this State)
have been met.
(Dec. 28, 2015, P.L.559, No.94, eff. imd.)
§ 7611. Modification of child support order of another state.
(a) Authority.--After a child support order issued in
another state has been registered in this State, the responding
tribunal of this State may modify that order, upon petition,
only if section 7613 (relating to jurisdiction to modify child
support order of another state when individual parties reside
in this State) does not apply and after notice and hearing it
finds one of the following:
(1) The following requirements are met:
(i) the child, the individual obligee and the
obligor do not reside in the issuing state;
(ii) a petitioner who is a nonresident of this State
seeks modification; and
(iii) the respondent is subject to the personal
jurisdiction of the tribunal of this State.
(2) This State is the residence of the child, or a party
who is an individual is subject to the personal jurisdiction
of the tribunal of this State; and all of the parties who
are individuals have filed consents in a record in the
issuing tribunal for a tribunal of this State to modify the
support order and assume continuing, exclusive jurisdiction
over the order.
(b) General rule.--Modification of a registered child
support order is subject to the same requirements, procedures
and defenses that apply to the modification of an order issued
by a tribunal of this State, and the order may be enforced and
satisfied in the same manner.
(c) Restriction.--A tribunal of this State may not modify
any aspect of a child support order that may not be modified
under the law of the issuing state, including the duration of
the obligation of support. If two or more tribunals have issued
child support orders for the same obligor and child, the order
that controls and must be so recognized under section 7207
(relating to determination of controlling child support order)
establishes the aspects of the support order which are not
modifiable.
(c.1) Modification.--In a proceeding to modify a child
support order, the law of the state that is determined to have
issued the initial controlling order governs the duration of
the obligation of support. The obligor's fulfillment of the
duty of support established by that order precludes imposition
of a further obligation of support by a tribunal of this State.
(d) Continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.--On issuance of an
order by a tribunal of this State modifying a child support
order issued in another state, a tribunal of this State becomes
the tribunal of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.
(e) Filing.--(Deleted by amendment).
(f) Retained jurisdiction.--Notwithstanding subsection (a),
(b), (c) or (d) or section 7201(b) (relating to bases for
jurisdiction over nonresident), a tribunal of this State retains
jurisdiction to modify an order issued by a tribunal of this
State if the following are met:
(1) One party resides in another state.
(2) The other party resides outside the United States.
(Dec. 16, 1997, P.L.549, No.58, eff. Jan. 1, 1998; Dec. 28,

§ 7612. Recognition of order modified in another state.

is modified by a tribunal of another state which assumed
jurisdiction under a law substantially similar to this part,
all of the following are available to a tribunal of this State:
(1) A tribunal may enforce the order that was modified
only as to arrears and interest accruing before the
modification.
(2) (Deleted by amendment).
(3) A tribunal may provide appropriate relief for
violations of that order which occurred before the effective
date of the modification.
(4) A tribunal shall recognize the modifying order of
the other state upon registration for the purpose of
enforcement.

§ 7613. Jurisdiction to modify child support order of another
state when individual parties reside in this State.
(a) General rule.--If all of the parties who are individuals
reside in this State and the child does not reside in the

in each tribunal in which the party knows the earlier order had
been registered. A party who obtains the order and fails to

tribunal in which the issue of failure to file arises. The
failure to file does not affect the validity or enforceability
of the modified order of the new tribunal having continuing,
exclusive jurisdiction.

been issued in the county where the obligee resides, the
order most recently issued must be recognized.
(3) If two or more tribunals have issued support orders
for the same obligation and none of the tribunals would have
continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this part, the

is admissible in evidence if given under oath by a party or
witness.

payments certified as a true copy of the original by the
custodian of the record may be forwarded to a responding
tribunal. The copy is evidence of facts asserted in it and is
admissible to show whether payments were made.
(e) Bills.--Copies of bills for testing for parentage and
for prenatal and postnatal health care of the mother and child,
furnished to the adverse party at least ten days before trial,
are admissible in evidence to prove the amount of the charges
billed and that the charges were reasonable, necessary and

expenses incurred by the obligee and the obligee's witnesses.
The tribunal may not assess fees, costs or expenses against the
department or against the support enforcement agency of either
the initiating county or the responding county except as

to the obligee has priority over fees, costs and expenses.
(c) Dilatory actions.--Except as provided in subsection
(a), the tribunal shall order the payment of costs and
reasonable attorney fees if it determines that a hearing was
requested primarily for delay. In a proceeding under Chapter
76 (relating to enforcement and modification of support order

Preamble
It is the intention of the General Assembly by enacting 23
Pa.C.S. § 4327 (relating to postsecondary educational costs)
to codify the decision of the Superior Court in the case of
Ulmer v. Sommerville, 200 Pa. Superior Ct. 640, 190 A.2d 182
(1963), and the subsequent line of cases interpreting Ulmer
prior to the decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in Blue
v. Blue, 532 Pa. 521, 616 A.2d 628 (1992), decided on November
13, 1992.
Further, the General Assembly finds that it has a rational
and legitimate governmental interest in requiring some parental
financial assistance for a higher education for children of
parents who are separated, divorced, unmarried or otherwise
subject to an existing support obligation.
Explanatory Note. Act 62 amended or added sections 4302,

1998, NOVEMBER 24, P.L.811, NO.103
Preamble
The General Assembly finds and declares as follows:
(1) Existing law does not provide adequately for the
needs of a parent who is terminally ill or who is
periodically incapable of caring for the needs of a minor
due to the parent's incapacity or debilitation resulting
from illness and who desires to make long-term plans for the
future of a minor without terminating or limiting in any way
the parent's legal rights.
(2) It is the intent of the General Assembly to create
an expeditious procedure which will enable a parent who is
terminally ill or periodically incapable or debilitated to
make long-term plans for a minor without terminating or
limiting in any manner parental rights.

Preamble
The General Assembly finds and declares as follows:
(1) The provisions of 23 Pa.C.S. Ch. 61 (relating to
protection from abuse) are necessary and proper in that they
further the Commonwealth's compelling State interest to
protect victims of domestic violence from abuse.
(2) The Second Amendment to the Constitution of the
United States and section 21 of Article I of the Constitution
of Pennsylvania recognize a fundamental right to keep and
bear arms.
(3) The limitation of firearm rights for the duration
of a protection from abuse order as authorized by 23 Pa.C.S.
Ch. 61 is a reasonable regulation, a valid exercise of the
police power of the Commonwealth and furthers the compelling
State interest to protect victims from abuse.
(4) As provided in 23 Pa.C.S. Ch. 61, a court may impose
limitations on firearm rights prohibiting someone who has
engaged in domestic violence from possessing firearms when
the court deems it appropriate to do so in order to protect
a victim.

The General Assembly finds and declares as follows:
(1) The Commonwealth has a duty to protect all children
in this Commonwealth, and all three branches of the State
government play important roles in fulfilling that duty.
(2) Domestic abuse is a pattern of abuse within the
family or household and can include abuse of a partner,
spouse, child or pet.
(3) Although abusers often use physical violence as one
of the tactics to commit domestic abuse, these tactics are
not necessarily physical or illegal.
(4) These tactics can include verbal, emotional,
psychological and economic abuse, isolation, threats,
controlling behaviors, monitoring, litigation abuse and
threats to seek or demands for custody or joint custody to
pressure the partner to return or punish the partner for
leaving.
(5) The health and safety of all children in this
Commonwealth must be the first priority in all decisions
concerning child custody.
(6) It is the intent of the General Assembly to ensure
that in all cases and controversies before the courts
involving questions of child custody, the health, safety and
welfare of the child are protected and regarded as issues
of paramount importance.
